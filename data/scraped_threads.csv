2014-06-11T15:54:16-0700,"Ok,QUESTION: Can I have another post if I have a question - or decide I want to offer pokemon for trade aside from my pokemon wants/needs? Cuz at this point, I really have no wants/needs, but at some future point I may want to get specific IV pokemon for a competitive team or two. But until then, I don't mind doing some trades to help people - with some of my event pokes, or shiny's or even some of my 5 IV pokemon. Anyways that's my reasoning. If it's a problem, you can just delete this post and I'll have my answer, and no worries, mate."
2014-06-11T18:02:38-0700,"hmmmmmm- good question-for the time being, I suppose a second post will suffice until we have a trade system up.

2013-11-08T13:13:20-0800,"You maxed out your friend codes??!! How many is that? I registered 20 people so far, however some might not have gotten around to registering me for one reason or another (perhaps they have been busy with real life, or - I hope this isn't the case but .... they may not recognize me as a friend - who knows?) but my 3DS hasn't said anything about not being able to input any more yet."
2013-11-08T14:15:04-0800,"I don't know the max number of friends- most of everyone who posted here has not added me as it is. The ones I do have are repeat Pokemon, and I do not know just yet how to drop the repeats. The SZ is getting lame, as I can only see two Pokemon (which I have 7 zones that offer the same Pokemon - well, at least 1 like I have 3 zones that have Nincada)- but it is a waste of time getting only 2 to appear when I have what zones I have that share a 1 common Pokemon. The only ""stand out Pokemon is Wartortal in my whole list for my zones. Lame if you ask me.I spent 15 minutes before Wortortal even showed. Of all my zones- 3 display all 3 Pokemon.Whats the deal?"
2013-11-08T14:46:44-0800,"Oh I can answer that. I've never actually done it yet, because I have no reason to do so since I'm quite happy with all the friend safaris that I have. However, if you do happen to have quite a number of repeat safaris and you want to pare them down to just ones you'd go on, follow these easy steps ...... Step 1 - make sure you have in mind the profile you want to delete. Step 2 - on the friend code page touch ""Settings"" with your stylus. Step 3 - Touch ""Delete Friend Card."" Step 4 - do like it says and select a friend card to delete. The system says that once you decide who you want to delete, you no longer will be friends with that person - but no notification will be sent to the other person. It asks if this is ok. If you say yes by touching ok, or pressing the A button, it deletes the person as a friend. Of course that doesn't mean you can't add the person again at a later date."

I was looking for that for a while.Yours may be, but I still have lots of room!Don't get me wrong, but can't you just get that at the start of the game pretty much? Or are you looking for a specific one? You could also just breed one....."
2013-11-22T18:40:17-0800,^ The SZ provides Pokémon with 2 perfect 31 IV's in the Pokémon's Base stats. This is a better option to get Pokémon that have the 2 31's vs trying to catch them in the wild.Makes breeding so much easier.............
2013-11-22T18:54:38-0800,"Yeah, so I've been told. So what's the easy way to see which ones actually have those 2 perfect IV's in any particular species? I know of one person who is looking for max IV's in Dittos, and now Fletchinders. Are all SZ pokemon that way, or are the odds just stacked in favor of finding more perfect IV's?"
2013-11-22T19:02:49-0800,"^ In the Kiloude City Pokcenter, there is a man off to the left who will tell you which 2 IV's are a 31 on the Pokémon you obtained in the SZ. The guy will even tell you if a Pokémon has a really low IV in a stat (if it is really low or even a zero).The odds are not stacked for getting 2 perfect IV's on a SZ Pokémon. Getting the right Nature from an SZ Pokémon, now that is where you will find those odds......Edit-------------Since Ditto is the breeding king for compatibility, getting Ditto's with 2 31 IV's (if lucky, more then 2 but a guaranteed 2 31's) is most definitely the current ""must have"" SZ Pokémon of choice by the competitive scene."
2013-11-22T19:17:34-0800,"Yeah, I can understand that. Ok, well once I get a full box of Ditto I'll check them all out. I'm about half way there.While I'm doing that, I'm also propagating the pokerus by having a pokemon with it in my party, then giving it to my caught dittos as well. They don't all catch it right away before I put them into storage, since I don't have the time to keep it up, but I'll be getting a lot by the time the weekend is up.Edit: Ok, so [DEL]when that guy says that such and such stat ""can't be beat,"" then you can pretty much say that they are maxed out, right[/DEL]?EDIT#2: I later figured out that wasn't the case, but it was just an expression he says at the end of his speech. I still have yet to find a good guide to what he means.If so, as of this moment I have about 40 Dittos, 27 of which have the pokerus, a large number of which have at least 2 maxed out IV's, a few with only one maxed, and 3 or 4 with no maxed stats. For a few hours of harvesting Dittos, I think it didn't turn out too bad.For you mods, I apologize for taking this subject so off topic. In any case, I'm willing to trade to those who have registered my FC. I'm not looking for anything special, but I'm doing this as a favor. If you'd like to trade a good pokemon for them, I certainly won't object, but that's not my goal. Preference will be given to those who pm me a trade request, but any time I'm online with the game I don't mind trading. That will all start later on today. It's well past my bedtime. I'm off."
2013-11-22T22:39:18-0800,"@P_AThe 2 31 Ivs can be useful for breeding. With the ability to get both male a female versions, I can pass down 4 31 IVs. Also the FS has fletchinders with their hidden ability, which gives all flying moves +1 priority.Its very useful for my bird team."

2013-11-25T03:29:53-0800,"Ah yes, thanks again. I also made a stats comparison spreadsheet in excel to help me out. It was time consuming but once it was done I was able to clearly see how each pokemon stats measured up. I'll bookmark that page to help out as well."
2013-11-26T06:30:55-0800,"New info: My son Josh is just starting out with friend codes on his Y game. He may not read the gym much, but if your willing, he's willing to FC people as well. I updated his game to have all the FC's that I have, so if you'd like to add him here is his code:5300-9685-0389As far as I can tell, his FS is Ground with Camerupt and Trapinch. Weird. Not sure what his 3rd one is yet. EDIT: Diggersby is his 3rd."
2013-11-26T16:47:36-0800,This may seem stupid but i have a lot of aquaintances and dont know where to type friend codes or anything. Could someone help me?
2013-11-26T17:55:58-0800,"You use the friend code of your 3DS. There should be a face on the top of your 3DS's main menu. When you click that, you can view your 3DS friend code and input your friends code."
2013-11-26T21:25:25-0800,"Nope, not stupid at all, everyone's gotta start somewhere, right?First, before you can do what Vaporeon is suggesting, you need to make a ""mii"". Essentially that's a character representation of yourself (essentially an avatar of yourself that you use to represent you online) that you make using the Mii Maker software on your Home screen that comes up when you turn your 3DS on. I made a representation (a poor one in any case) without using a picture of myself, but the software can do a reasonably close figure on it's own - or so I've been told. Then once you do that, ..... again, on your home screen at the top, there's a smiley face which when opened up shows you what your friend code is. The code is linked to your 3DS .... NOT WHATEVER GAME YOU HAPPEN TO BE PLAYING IN YOUR GAME SLOT. You can choose to allow other people see what game you are playing, your favorite game, and when you were last online. It's entirely up to you what you choose to allow others to see, but ...... parental note coming next: ...... it might be worthwhile to note that younger players should not give out too much info. Once you have your friend code, you can certainly give your code to others - even if they aren't your friends, just like here on this thread. Just be aware that your info is now public - if you decide to make it so.One thing to note, that if you do happen to give out your friend code here, everyone benefits from being able to go on ""your"" friend safari (even though you personally can't go to your own), and you get the added benefit of being able to trade with more players in the community, and the ability of both using and receiving ""O-Powers"" as well. It definitely is a win-win situation in that respect.How to register codes? That's easy. Once you've finished getting your own code, just re-open the smiley face and notice at the top of the touch screen where it says ""Register Friend."" Click on that, put in the 12 digit friend codes of any people that you want, then add their names. As is noted earlier in this thread, you can input quite a few codes before your 3DS is full, so register away! Once you've done that, it might be wise to let the other person know that you've friended them in your game, so they can register your FC. That's all you need to do. Every once in a while you can open the friend code app and see who's online, or you can see them as a lighter colored person in your Player Search System (the screen that normally is up on the touch screen when you're not in a battle). If both you and your friend happen to be registered, you should be able to see them up in the ""Friends"" section, instead of the ""Acquaintances"" or ""Passersby"" sections. Most times after that, you can interact with your friends by clicking on their lighted avatar, unless they are busy either trading or in a battle (which happens a lot, so don't be discouraged if you don't get to trade with them the first time you see their avatar lighted). Don't worry, over time it will be second nature.Good luck, and I hope to see a lot more of your friend codes here on this thread.Edit: One thing I neglected to mention is that if you don't know the exact name of the person you plan to ""friend"" you don't need to worry. You can input what you think their name might be, or (if you like), whatever you decide to call someone - for example Benzo's name on his game is also Benzo. My personal name is Garret, but my game name is P_A. When your 2 codes are linked as friends, your 3DS system will let you know what the other person is registered as, and from that point on you'll know that person as the registered name. No sweat."
2013-11-26T22:14:28-0800,I Didnt realize that friends were a 3ds thing rather than each individual game. Thanks for the in depth description P A. I will post my code here tomorrow when i get home

2013-12-04T16:07:27-0800,"Hey great, good to see you here.[DEL] It's nice that you want to add to the amount of codes available, but it might be wise to make sure you have their permission to do so. In fact, it might be better to have them give out their codes themselves - just to be sure, since they may not want their information public.[/DEL] EDIT: ARGH! I can't believe I took your post wrong by accident. Sorry about that! At least I figured out afterward that you needed to put in everyone's codes later on tonight. Now I feel kinda silly.:redface:Yes, this IS an amazing thread showing some great community spirit. I'm looking forward to seeing a lot more people and codes here! Welcome to everyone!"

2013-12-04T18:41:18-0800,"So far a great turn out for codes indeed! Keep them coming!I think it is safe to assume that if people are posting their FC's in here unless specifically stating that they will give you their FC via PM that it is ""open permission"" to add them."
2014-01-20T05:39:22-0800,Hi everyoneI was wondering why some of my friends only had two pokemon in the safari. I don't think it's because they haven't beaten the elite four because they have been friends for a while and other people were able to see their third pokemon. After doing a little research online I saw that the friend had to be online at the same time as you. This seems like it is very tedious. Is there an easier way to get access to the third pokemon?
2014-01-24T21:55:18-0800,"^ There is no other way to activate the3rd slot. You both need to be on-line at the same time, but not both playing the game."
2014-01-25T16:04:02-0800,"That doesn't seem to necessarily hold true for locally added friends. I added someone IRL yesterday and immediately had his Ponyta available.Definitely true for online, however."
2014-01-26T14:20:30-0800,"^ Thank you for clarification on that- my reply should have included ""local"" adding in general which indeed is immediate."
2014-01-27T09:35:32-0800,I kinda knew that. My post was more asking is there an easy way to get a friend to be online at the same time as me. Sorry if my post was not clear.
2014-01-28T13:29:40-0800,"Actually that seems to be wrong. I added some friends (from elsewhere) and we were online at the same time, according to 3DS friends list but my game wasn't on. I later go and turn on Pokemon Y and one of the guys is online in the game and appears in the friends section of the PSS. I only got the 3rd pokemon on his friend safari and not the other guys who were online at the same time but not while I was online in game. Turns out you need to be online int the actual game to get the 3rd friend safari pokemon. That or my game is very broken. You can tell when you have done this when the persons PSS avatar appears on the friend safari list. I can vouch for rivershock and say that locally added friends maybe an exception.Unfortunately because of that I still don't know the contents of my friend safari. Local added friends haven't completed the main game yet so I can't find out form them.I'll post my FC in the hopes that 1) someone who adds me will be online at the same time and 2) they can notify me the contents of my safari so I can edit this post and add it in.FC: 0533-5637-0926PM me if you add me and we'll sort out a time to be online at the same time so that the full contents of the safari can be seen."

2013-10-22T19:42:30-0700,Your 3DS has it's own Friend Code that the Pokémon X and Y Versions use for Wi-Fi instead of a code found with in the game itself.For those of you who would like to post their Friend Code- here is where you can do so if you would like anyone to add you to your games.Post away if you would like to be added!Mine is in siggy if ya'd like to add me :smile:

I registered 20 people so far, however some might not have gotten around to registering me for one reason or another (perhaps they have been busy with real life, or - I hope this isn't the case but .... they may not recognize me as a friend - who knows?) but my 3DS hasn't said anything about not being able to input any more yet."
2013-11-08T14:15:04-0800,"I don't know the max number of friends- most of everyone who posted here has not added me as it is. The ones I do have are repeat Pokemon, and I do not know just yet how to drop the repeats. The SZ is getting lame, as I can only see two Pokemon (which I have 7 zones that offer the same Pokemon - well, at least 1 like I have 3 zones that have Nincada)- but it is a waste of time getting only 2 to appear when I have what zones I have that share a 1 common Pokemon. The only ""stand out Pokemon is Wartortal in my whole list for my zones. Lame if you ask me.I spent 15 minutes before Wortortal even showed. Of all my zones- 3 display all 3 Pokemon.Whats the deal?"
2013-11-08T14:46:44-0800,"Oh I can answer that. I've never actually done it yet, because I have no reason to do so since I'm quite happy with all the friend safaris that I have. However, if you do happen to have quite a number of repeat safaris and you want to pare them down to just ones you'd go on, follow these easy steps ...... Step 1 - make sure you have in mind the profile you want to delete. Step 2 - on the friend code page touch ""Settings"" with your stylus. Step 3 - Touch ""Delete Friend Card."" Step 4 - do like it says and select a friend card to delete. The system says that once you decide who you want to delete, you no longer will be friends with that person - but no notification will be sent to the other person. It asks if this is ok. If you say yes by touching ok, or pressing the A button, it deletes the person as a friend. Of course that doesn't mean you can't add the person again at a later date."

2013-11-21T21:28:00-0800,keniselvis you have electric: Emolga Manetric stunfisk
2013-11-22T04:38:34-0800,Thanks!!!!now to find a freaking ditto!!!!
2013-11-22T08:08:19-0800,Friends list is now full.
2013-11-22T11:11:43-0800,Does anyone have Fletchinder on their friend safari?
2013-11-22T18:36:34-0800,"I'm ditto-ing for someone else in one of the safaris I have. Whatcha looking for? Just any one or a specific one? Oh and thanks for the Emolga! I was looking for that for a while.Yours may be, but I still have lots of room!Don't get me wrong, but can't you just get that at the start of the game pretty much? Or are you looking for a specific one? You could also just breed one....."
2013-11-22T18:40:17-0800,^ The SZ provides Pokémon with 2 perfect 31 IV's in the Pokémon's Base stats. This is a better option to get Pokémon that have the 2 31's vs trying to catch them in the wild.Makes breeding so much easier.............
2013-11-22T18:54:38-0800,"Yeah, so I've been told. So what's the easy way to see which ones actually have those 2 perfect IV's in any particular species? I know of one person who is looking for max IV's in Dittos, and now Fletchinders. Are all SZ pokemon that way, or are the odds just stacked in favor of finding more perfect IV's?"
2013-11-22T19:02:49-0800,"^ In the Kiloude City Pokcenter, there is a man off to the left who will tell you which 2 IV's are a 31 on the Pokémon you obtained in the SZ. The guy will even tell you if a Pokémon has a really low IV in a stat (if it is really low or even a zero).The odds are not stacked for getting 2 perfect IV's on a SZ Pokémon. Getting the right Nature from an SZ Pokémon, now that is where you will find those odds......Edit-------------Since Ditto is the breeding king for compatibility, getting Ditto's with 2 31 IV's (if lucky, more then 2 but a guaranteed 2 31's) is most definitely the current ""must have"" SZ Pokémon of choice by the competitive scene."
2013-11-22T19:17:34-0800,"Yeah, I can understand that. Ok, well once I get a full box of Ditto I'll check them all out. I'm about half way there.While I'm doing that, I'm also propagating the pokerus by having a pokemon with it in my party, then giving it to my caught dittos as well. They don't all catch it right away before I put them into storage, since I don't have the time to keep it up, but I'll be getting a lot by the time the weekend is up.Edit: Ok, so [DEL]when that guy says that such and such stat ""can't be beat,"" then you can pretty much say that they are maxed out, right[/DEL]?EDIT#2: I later figured out that wasn't the case, but it was just an expression he says at the end of his speech. I still have yet to find a good guide to what he means.If so, as of this moment I have about 40 Dittos, 27 of which have the pokerus, a large number of which have at least 2 maxed out IV's, a few with only one maxed, and 3 or 4 with no maxed stats. For a few hours of harvesting Dittos, I think it didn't turn out too bad.For you mods, I apologize for taking this subject so off topic. In any case, I'm willing to trade to those who have registered my FC. I'm not looking for anything special, but I'm doing this as a favor. If you'd like to trade a good pokemon for them, I certainly won't object, but that's not my goal. Preference will be given to those who pm me a trade request, but any time I'm online with the game I don't mind trading. That will all start later on today. It's well past my bedtime. I'm off."
2013-11-22T22:39:18-0800,"@P_AThe 2 31 Ivs can be useful for breeding. With the ability to get both male a female versions, I can pass down 4 31 IVs. Also the FS has fletchinders with their hidden ability, which gives all flying moves +1 priority.Its very useful for my bird team."
2013-11-24T09:02:21-0800,Looking to find out whats in my friend safari & also looking for someone who has Ditto's in there's (I want to start IV/EV Training)My FC is: 0061-1006-8032Edit: Forgot to mention I have added everyone above me
2013-11-24T10:25:54-0800,"Karlos, you have Skarmory, and Magneton. I don't have a Ditto in my FS, but I've harvested a bunch and given them the pokerus. Find me online today and I'll trade you one if that will help."
2013-11-24T10:27:11-0800,"So I'm steel, Thats cool. Thank you for that! Won't ever say no to Pokerus!"
2013-11-24T11:38:15-0800,"@ P_A - don't worry, it is not that far off topic since this thread is about the SZ and having what ""off topic"" info in here is very helpfull in understanding the point of the usefulness of the SZ. The info supports the want to obtain FC's for the cause of contributing to the game with in the community.I have added everyone, but only a few of you register. I have 38 FC's- which only 18 are ""active"" (7 are not FC's from here)Still looking to add more!"
2013-11-24T11:52:08-0800,"Well then! Glad to be of service! LOL.Keep the friend codes coming guys!Edit: Karlos, are you interested in a particular nature or maxed out stat? Or will any of the 40 or so do that I have available?"
2013-11-24T12:10:07-0800,"Any of the 40 would be amazing thank you! I will mostly be keeping him/her boxed & only using for the PokerusEdit: Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!! That Pokerus Ditto will definitely come in handy!"
2013-11-24T12:31:35-0800,"My pleasure. Now that you and I have traded, Klefki has also shown up in your FS."
2013-11-24T13:05:56-0800,Anyone with Fletchinders in their safari?
2013-11-24T21:17:59-0800,"@ P_A:Since I have mentioned the IV Judge in Kiloude City, here is the info regarding his judgment calls and what they mean:http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Stats_judgeI hope this is of help when you use him to find out about SZ and breed Pokies for IV checks."
2013-11-25T03:29:53-0800,"Ah yes, thanks again. I also made a stats comparison spreadsheet in excel to help me out. It was time consuming but once it was done I was able to clearly see how each pokemon stats measured up. I'll bookmark that page to help out as well."
2013-11-26T06:30:55-0800,"New info: My son Josh is just starting out with friend codes on his Y game. He may not read the gym much, but if your willing, he's willing to FC people as well. I updated his game to have all the FC's that I have, so if you'd like to add him here is his code:5300-9685-0389As far as I can tell, his FS is Ground with Camerupt and Trapinch. Weird. Not sure what his 3rd one is yet. EDIT: Diggersby is his 3rd."
2013-11-26T16:47:36-0800,This may seem stupid but i have a lot of aquaintances and dont know where to type friend codes or anything. Could someone help me?
2013-11-26T17:55:58-0800,"You use the friend code of your 3DS. There should be a face on the top of your 3DS's main menu. When you click that, you can view your 3DS friend code and input your friends code."
2013-11-26T21:25:25-0800,"Nope, not stupid at all, everyone's gotta start somewhere, right?First, before you can do what Vaporeon is suggesting, you need to make a ""mii"". Essentially that's a character representation of yourself (essentially an avatar of yourself that you use to represent you online) that you make using the Mii Maker software on your Home screen that comes up when you turn your 3DS on. I made a representation (a poor one in any case) without using a picture of myself, but the software can do a reasonably close figure on it's own - or so I've been told. Then once you do that, ..... again, on your home screen at the top, there's a smiley face which when opened up shows you what your friend code is. The code is linked to your 3DS .... NOT WHATEVER GAME YOU HAPPEN TO BE PLAYING IN YOUR GAME SLOT. You can choose to allow other people see what game you are playing, your favorite game, and when you were last online. It's entirely up to you what you choose to allow others to see, but ...... parental note coming next: ...... it might be worthwhile to note that younger players should not give out too much info. Once you have your friend code, you can certainly give your code to others - even if they aren't your friends, just like here on this thread. Just be aware that your info is now public - if you decide to make it so.One thing to note, that if you do happen to give out your friend code here, everyone benefits from being able to go on ""your"" friend safari (even though you personally can't go to your own), and you get the added benefit of being able to trade with more players in the community, and the ability of both using and receiving ""O-Powers"" as well. It definitely is a win-win situation in that respect.How to register codes? That's easy. Once you've finished getting your own code, just re-open the smiley face and notice at the top of the touch screen where it says ""Register Friend."" Click on that, put in the 12 digit friend codes of any people that you want, then add their names. As is noted earlier in this thread, you can input quite a few codes before your 3DS is full, so register away! Once you've done that, it might be wise to let the other person know that you've friended them in your game, so they can register your FC. That's all you need to do. Every once in a while you can open the friend code app and see who's online, or you can see them as a lighter colored person in your Player Search System (the screen that normally is up on the touch screen when you're not in a battle). If both you and your friend happen to be registered, you should be able to see them up in the ""Friends"" section, instead of the ""Acquaintances"" or ""Passersby"" sections. Most times after that, you can interact with your friends by clicking on their lighted avatar, unless they are busy either trading or in a battle (which happens a lot, so don't be discouraged if you don't get to trade with them the first time you see their avatar lighted). Don't worry, over time it will be second nature.Good luck, and I hope to see a lot more of your friend codes here on this thread.Edit: One thing I neglected to mention is that if you don't know the exact name of the person you plan to ""friend"" you don't need to worry. You can input what you think their name might be, or (if you like), whatever you decide to call someone - for example Benzo's name on his game is also Benzo. My personal name is Garret, but my game name is P_A. When your 2 codes are linked as friends, your 3DS system will let you know what the other person is registered as, and from that point on you'll know that person as the registered name. No sweat."
2013-11-26T22:14:28-0800,I Didnt realize that friends were a 3ds thing rather than each individual game. Thanks for the in depth description P A. I will post my code here tomorrow when i get home

2013-12-04T16:07:27-0800,"Hey great, good to see you here.[DEL] It's nice that you want to add to the amount of codes available, but it might be wise to make sure you have their permission to do so. In fact, it might be better to have them give out their codes themselves - just to be sure, since they may not want their information public.[/DEL] EDIT: ARGH! I can't believe I took your post wrong by accident. Sorry about that! At least I figured out afterward that you needed to put in everyone's codes later on tonight. Now I feel kinda silly.:redface:Yes, this IS an amazing thread showing some great community spirit. I'm looking forward to seeing a lot more people and codes here! Welcome to everyone!"
2013-12-04T18:05:31-0800,
2013-12-04T18:41:18-0800,"So far a great turn out for codes indeed! Keep them coming!I think it is safe to assume that if people are posting their FC's in here unless specifically stating that they will give you their FC via PM that it is ""open permission"" to add them."
2014-01-20T05:39:22-0800,Hi everyoneI was wondering why some of my friends only had two pokemon in the safari. I don't think it's because they haven't beaten the elite four because they have been friends for a while and other people were able to see their third pokemon. After doing a little research online I saw that the friend had to be online at the same time as you. This seems like it is very tedious. Is there an easier way to get access to the third pokemon?
2014-01-24T21:55:18-0800,"^ There is no other way to activate the3rd slot. You both need to be on-line at the same time, but not both playing the game."
2014-01-25T16:04:02-0800,"That doesn't seem to necessarily hold true for locally added friends. I added someone IRL yesterday and immediately had his Ponyta available.Definitely true for online, however."
2014-01-26T14:20:30-0800,"^ Thank you for clarification on that- my reply should have included ""local"" adding in general which indeed is immediate."
2014-01-27T09:35:32-0800,I kinda knew that. My post was more asking is there an easy way to get a friend to be online at the same time as me. Sorry if my post was not clear.
2014-01-28T13:29:40-0800,"Actually that seems to be wrong. I added some friends (from elsewhere) and we were online at the same time, according to 3DS friends list but my game wasn't on. I later go and turn on Pokemon Y and one of the guys is online in the game and appears in the friends section of the PSS. I only got the 3rd pokemon on his friend safari and not the other guys who were online at the same time but not while I was online in game. Turns out you need to be online int the actual game to get the 3rd friend safari pokemon. That or my game is very broken. You can tell when you have done this when the persons PSS avatar appears on the friend safari list. I can vouch for rivershock and say that locally added friends maybe an exception.Unfortunately because of that I still don't know the contents of my friend safari. Local added friends haven't completed the main game yet so I can't find out form them.I'll post my FC in the hopes that 1) someone who adds me will be online at the same time and 2) they can notify me the contents of my safari so I can edit this post and add it in.FC: 0533-5637-0926PM me if you add me and we'll sort out a time to be online at the same time so that the full contents of the safari can be seen."

2014-01-20T05:39:22-0800,Hi everyoneI was wondering why some of my friends only had two pokemon in the safari. I don't think it's because they haven't beaten the elite four because they have been friends for a while and other people were able to see their third pokemon. After doing a little research online I saw that the friend had to be online at the same time as you. This seems like it is very tedious. Is there an easier way to get access to the third pokemon?
2014-01-24T21:55:18-0800,"^ There is no other way to activate the3rd slot. You both need to be on-line at the same time, but not both playing the game."

This is false. It has been illegal to have a back-up of a video game of any kind sence 1983:""in the U.S. it has been illegal since 1983 for a user to create their own backups of video game ROMs onto other cartridges. This was decided in the court case of Atari v. JS&A. JS&A manufactured a ""game backup"" device that allowed users to dump their Atari ROMs onto a blank cartridge. JS&A argued that the archival rule allowed for this. The court disagreed, noting that ROM media was not subject to the same volatility as magnetic media (for which the law was created). Thus, not being so relatively vulnerable, ROMs were not applicable under section 17 USC 117(a)(2).Some games companies, such as Nintendo, print warnings inside their game manuals that they do not allow users to make backup or archival copies.""We here on the Pokegym also suggest that anyone who sees these devices being sold either online or in stores should contact Nintendo Anti-Piracy division to report it.You can report Piracy to these web sites:Nintendo Anti-Piracy site:http://ap.nintendo.com/Entertainment Software Association:http://www.theesa.com/This does NOT include features already programed into the game (RNG's,In-game passwords,Etc.)An example of what is OK to post:As such, we do not see anything as ""legal"" hacks.

2016-07-19T10:34:54-0700,"Considering that breeding Pokemon in the games has made it easier to have Pokemon with 4,5,even 6 31 IV's (individual stats), this new feature in Sun and Moon might be of some good use for raising that perfect Pokemon for battles.In my opinion, it has been a long time waiting for this to be something that a competitive player could have used 5 years ago. True, the breeding mechanics have vastly improved in being able to at least control the nature of a Pokemon. Being able to hand-down certain IV's from parents. using hold items. Hold items in general for breeding did receive the boosting of the chances to be able to pass along IV's.Seeing the competitive scene grow more and more every year, dedication to breeding, EV training, move tutor, leveling up, egg moves, nature selection- the list goes on- it is great to see that the player base now has a rather helpfull new mechanic in being able to finally boost IV's!Breeding, breeding, and- hatching. You get the right nature! You get 3 31 IV's! Missing the right IV slots, well- back to the breeding............ / This. This has been one of the factors of ""time wasted"" in trying to get exactly what you want out of breeding. Let me break it down for a minute, on what it takes to get that perfect Pokemon ready for the big competitions:Take Parent A, 99% of the time being Ditto, Ditto having hopefully 3 31 IV stats, have it hold the Destiny Knot item to pass on the 3 31 IV stats to the hatch-ling.Take Pokemon B, which has the nature you want to hand down to the hatch-ling, have it hold the Everstone to pass down that desired nature.Place both Pokemon A and B into the daycare.Ride your bike around near the daycare, wait for the mysterious process that has stumped daycare employees when an egg has appeared, and, take the mystery off their hands.Ride your bike in circles, until the egg hatches.Check out the new offspring for it's nature. Hope it also has the ability you want as well.Ok, the offspring has both nature and ability! -BUT, does it have good IV stats?NOPE............Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.Eventually you do end up with the Pokemon you want for that perfect team for , oh, Regional's, or an online competition. There is way more involved in raising a Pokemon then just what I outlined above. It is dedication. It is time spent. To a competitive player: it is time well spent.Yes, there has been many things done by Gamefreak to shorten the time it takes to get the Pokemon you want, the way you want it, the right moves, the right stats, the right IV's, and, that feeling of accomplishment and the reward of seeing your hard work pay off in a competition.Well, this new Hyper Training will hopefully shave off more time, and, make it easier to quickly produce that Pokemon you just breed for that wasn't quite as perfect as you had hoped. This Hyper Training process will also make it easier to get that Event Legendary that has a guaranteed 3 31 IV stats already. If you'd like, you could just breed for a Pokemon with the right nature, a few 31 IV's, EV train it, slap on the Lucky Egg and be at level 100 in no time.One thing I do also like about this new form of training is that it also does encourage more legit methods of obtaining Pokemon that can be easily more breed/raised for the player base, competitive or non-competitive.Hopefully, there is also a method to reduce an IV stat. Sometimes you just need to have a specific stat not be at it's best, that 31 that the rest of the stats you want- sometimes the ""best"" is not the best when you do need to have that lower speed stat on a Pokemon. Sometimes you need that lower stat for Hidden Power. There are yes, a few reasons to not have the 31 IV, so, I am hoping that with Sun and Moon there is that option/mechanic to lower an IV stat.In all, I am glad to see Hyper Training being included into the games. It is an over due option to be able to manipulate the IV's in which there is a lengthy process. This induction is a mechanic that some players could say ""Why get your Pokemon up to level 100 just so that you can adjust it's IV's then when you could just do what we have been doing all this time and stop at level 50 and be done?"" I do agree, to some degree. This Hyper Training is definitely an option, usable, has it's benefits, and as I see it- it will see a lot of use and is in an Arceus send to us gamers.What do you all think? Is Hyper Training something you think you will use? Do you think it is worth being a feature in the game, or is the current methods doing just fine for getting battle worthy Pokemon? Is there another option you would rather see for making Pokemon better?Thoughts? Ideas? Anything?"
2016-07-20T06:42:48-0700,"Life today is fast paced. Through one reason or another many people currently either won't take the time (due to having too many other more exciting pursuits) or can't afford the time (due to real life troubles intruding upon their gaming time) to train up their pokemon to ""perfection."" It's great to see that Nintendo has understood that issue and is making it easier. The games have to evolve just like the pokemon!"
2016-08-01T22:25:54-0700,That was a nice strategy. Will follow your guides.
2016-08-05T09:53:49-0700,I'm in full support that makes getting competitive Pokemon easier. Right now some people don't like the idea because it makes all their hard work invalid but this is a nice change. Hyper Training is something I look forward to. I do hope this makes it easy to get the right Hidden Power you want.
2016-08-05T13:26:59-0700,"Yeah, true. I know it took quite a while to get some of the ones I wanted, but now I don't have the time to devote to it. If there are some competitive pokemon in the new generation, then I'd rather have this hyper training .... than not have it. It's like when all those competive pokemon got nerfed from the scene in the X/Y generation (what is that .... Kanto?) .... at least you could train up some decent pokemon in the new generation ie. Kangaskhan. You couldn't use some of the older Zapdos, and the newer ones were kinda useless, but at least some of the new pokemon that you could raise were decent. We'll all get used to it in time.Once S/M comes out, I'm just wondering when they'll nerf the current generation of games and their pokemon. Obviously there's no way you can battle S/M pokemon with older ones unless they actually are on a S/M cartridge. I imagine that by the second set of regionals (spring 2017) this will happen. So hyper training might be a good thing to put everyone on the same footing (GASP!)"
2016-08-05T19:43:46-0700,"Who knows. I just wonder how they are going to balance the game. I really want a lot of the megas that need buffs to get them, same for other Pokemon. This game is looking to change how things are played but I wonder how deep they are going with this game."
2016-07-19T10:34:54-0700,"Considering that breeding Pokemon in the games has made it easier to have Pokemon with 4,5,even 6 31 IV's (individual stats), this new feature in Sun and Moon might be of some good use for raising that perfect Pokemon for battles.In my opinion, it has been a long time waiting for this to be something that a competitive player could have used 5 years ago. True, the breeding mechanics have vastly improved in being able to at least control the nature of a Pokemon. Being able to hand-down certain IV's from parents. using hold items. Hold items in general for breeding did receive the boosting of the chances to be able to pass along IV's.Seeing the competitive scene grow more and more every year, dedication to breeding, EV training, move tutor, leveling up, egg moves, nature selection- the list goes on- it is great to see that the player base now has a rather helpfull new mechanic in being able to finally boost IV's!Breeding, breeding, and- hatching. You get the right nature! You get 3 31 IV's! Missing the right IV slots, well- back to the breeding............ / This. This has been one of the factors of ""time wasted"" in trying to get exactly what you want out of breeding. Let me break it down for a minute, on what it takes to get that perfect Pokemon ready for the big competitions:Take Parent A, 99% of the time being Ditto, Ditto having hopefully 3 31 IV stats, have it hold the Destiny Knot item to pass on the 3 31 IV stats to the hatch-ling.Take Pokemon B, which has the nature you want to hand down to the hatch-ling, have it hold the Everstone to pass down that desired nature.Place both Pokemon A and B into the daycare.Ride your bike around near the daycare, wait for the mysterious process that has stumped daycare employees when an egg has appeared, and, take the mystery off their hands.Ride your bike in circles, until the egg hatches.Check out the new offspring for it's nature. Hope it also has the ability you want as well.Ok, the offspring has both nature and ability! -BUT, does it have good IV stats?NOPE............Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.Eventually you do end up with the Pokemon you want for that perfect team for , oh, Regional's, or an online competition. There is way more involved in raising a Pokemon then just what I outlined above. It is dedication. It is time spent. To a competitive player: it is time well spent.Yes, there has been many things done by Gamefreak to shorten the time it takes to get the Pokemon you want, the way you want it, the right moves, the right stats, the right IV's, and, that feeling of accomplishment and the reward of seeing your hard work pay off in a competition.Well, this new Hyper Training will hopefully shave off more time, and, make it easier to quickly produce that Pokemon you just breed for that wasn't quite as perfect as you had hoped. This Hyper Training process will also make it easier to get that Event Legendary that has a guaranteed 3 31 IV stats already. If you'd like, you could just breed for a Pokemon with the right nature, a few 31 IV's, EV train it, slap on the Lucky Egg and be at level 100 in no time.One thing I do also like about this new form of training is that it also does encourage more legit methods of obtaining Pokemon that can be easily more breed/raised for the player base, competitive or non-competitive.Hopefully, there is also a method to reduce an IV stat. Sometimes you just need to have a specific stat not be at it's best, that 31 that the rest of the stats you want- sometimes the ""best"" is not the best when you do need to have that lower speed stat on a Pokemon. Sometimes you need that lower stat for Hidden Power. There are yes, a few reasons to not have the 31 IV, so, I am hoping that with Sun and Moon there is that option/mechanic to lower an IV stat.In all, I am glad to see Hyper Training being included into the games. It is an over due option to be able to manipulate the IV's in which there is a lengthy process. This induction is a mechanic that some players could say ""Why get your Pokemon up to level 100 just so that you can adjust it's IV's then when you could just do what we have been doing all this time and stop at level 50 and be done?"" I do agree, to some degree. This Hyper Training is definitely an option, usable, has it's benefits, and as I see it- it will see a lot of use and is in an Arceus send to us gamers.What do you all think? Is Hyper Training something you think you will use? Do you think it is worth being a feature in the game, or is the current methods doing just fine for getting battle worthy Pokemon? Is there another option you would rather see for making Pokemon better?Thoughts? Ideas? Anything?"
2016-07-20T06:42:48-0700,"Life today is fast paced. Through one reason or another many people currently either won't take the time (due to having too many other more exciting pursuits) or can't afford the time (due to real life troubles intruding upon their gaming time) to train up their pokemon to ""perfection."" It's great to see that Nintendo has understood that issue and is making it easier. The games have to evolve just like the pokemon!"
2016-08-01T22:25:54-0700,That was a nice strategy. Will follow your guides.
2016-08-05T09:53:49-0700,I'm in full support that makes getting competitive Pokemon easier. Right now some people don't like the idea because it makes all their hard work invalid but this is a nice change. Hyper Training is something I look forward to. I do hope this makes it easy to get the right Hidden Power you want.
2016-08-05T13:26:59-0700,"Yeah, true. I know it took quite a while to get some of the ones I wanted, but now I don't have the time to devote to it. If there are some competitive pokemon in the new generation, then I'd rather have this hyper training .... than not have it. It's like when all those competive pokemon got nerfed from the scene in the X/Y generation (what is that .... Kanto?) .... at least you could train up some decent pokemon in the new generation ie. Kangaskhan. You couldn't use some of the older Zapdos, and the newer ones were kinda useless, but at least some of the new pokemon that you could raise were decent. We'll all get used to it in time.Once S/M comes out, I'm just wondering when they'll nerf the current generation of games and their pokemon.

2016-02-29T09:14:21-0800,"So what do you think we will see in the new games that come out this Fall?What would you like to see in the games?I would like to see a metal Eeevee evolution. Have Eevee hold the Metal Coat hold item and breed it with Mawile.Possible name for the metal type Eevee I would like to see: Mercureon ( after the planet Mercury, since the games have the theme)-Breeding with Legendary Pokémon to get either new type combos like Electric + Psychic type or the sort.This of course is early speculation, but trying to generate discussion is all. The only info out about the new games so far is the Man-made Diance + Klink ""hybrid/fusion"" (just using those words for description of how I see the image) Pokémon-Anyways, speak your thoughts! Speculate!"
2016-02-29T20:52:50-0800,"Well, I hear the bird is a woodpecker so I'll enjoy it. Its also rumored that the fire starter is a peacock. I just hope it stays that way and not turn into a bird person."
2016-03-01T09:40:36-0800,"I have soooo many ideas I'd like to see - literally, as the name of the games suggest, the sky's the limit! As of late I was seriously considering not picking up my pokemon games again - they've gotten stale. Don't get me wrong, I have all the latest games (B, W, Ruby, Sapphire, Alpha, Omega, X, Y .... and a few others including old Pokemon Box!). I've loved many different aspects of lots of them. Maybe the cure for my apathy is an expansion that not only has some new pokemon, and Mega pokemon, perhaps even some new types like ""light"" or ""gas"" (gotta catchem' all!), but an expansion that also EXPANDS from what they already built upon. It would be nice to be able to dig to the underground again, or the lost zone, grow berries and create pokeblocks that help your pokemon learn never before possible moves - or the ability to actually have 5 moves instead of 4. How about the ability to explore ALL the regions? How about the ability to liberate mistreated pokemon from bad owners and bring them back to the light? How about being able to fuse pokemon together? Oh man, this could seriously turn into a post that no one reads in it's entirety! I better stop for now. More later."
2016-03-01T11:55:19-0800,"Couldn't help myself. Had to put up another post!How about chances to battle people who have more than just a few pokemon (like maybe 5 or 6) earlier in the game? Berries that can randomly change your type, but when used with the right ingredients in a pokeblock (or pokepotion) gain the ability to change to a specific type for a battle (or a day, or maybe even permanently!) Or how about being able to change your ability (power) to another? (yes, I know that can be done now with the right item, but how about an easier way to do it?) How about having giveaways of special pokemon (special types/movesets/abilities) to those who contribute to the pokemon community - like LO's, LL's, TO's, PTO's, professors with over 100 lifetime points, pokemon website owners/ helpers? How about a loyalty giveaway to those who can produce 10 copies of different pokemon games? How about an even better giveaway for those who can produce 20 or more? More later."
2016-03-01T20:31:03-0800,"All I ask is that they finally get rid of that 2x2 square grid. That is ancient, atrocious game design that Square ditched over 20 years ago in pretty much the same type of game.As an Organizer, I'd like them to give us some sort of decent VGC prizes. Download codes, or something similar, for unique Pokemon, like that Pachi that won Worlds last year. But especially a more robust hack checking utility that can be used effectively within the time constraints of a standard tournament. The former would drive attendance. The latter would help keep the players they already got."
2016-03-02T05:44:56-0800,"How about more bird pokemon? More sky battles? More inverse battles for sure! Battles where you have a time limit? More puzzles? Yeah, I would like any and all of those things."
2016-03-02T14:12:15-0800,"Getting rid of the ""grid-walking"" would be nice. The 3DS can do so much, it seems it would be a sin if they didn't use the system (or NX when it is released) to it's fullest potential.Battle mechanics could use an upgrade, with Pekken being out- that-would-be-Awesome to see the battles done in that style (turn-based, that is going to be hard to ditch for Stat reasons).Gym Leader battles could be more intense. Instead of having to defeat them in order to advance in the story mode, the gyms could ""advance in level"" as your Pokémon leveled up.So many ways to get a Pokémon to evolve (heck, we have one that evolves when you hold your system up-side-down)- what if a Pokémon where to evolve (besides mega in battle) when you use a specific attack during the battle? And it stays permanent after the battle?Rotom- could use some more evo'sCastform- a sand form?Types I would like to see more of:SteelDarkFightingFairyZygard- all those forms, seems to me Legends could use altered/less base stat ""mini's"" for battles.A boost (non mega) to a good handful of Pokémon so that they can be tourney worthy to boost the battle roster."
2016-03-23T02:37:27-0700,I'm always willing to support more bird Pokemon. Maybe Pidgeot can get 2 more megas. That would be sweet! I too would also like to see Sky Battles being its own thing. The game just gave it to us but never really did anything with them.
2016-04-04T00:57:28-0700,"I'd like to see customization for the trainers make a return. Going from XY where you had tons of options to probably my least favorite design in terms of trainers (the RSE ones), I do miss them. Or a return to the older models of BW would be sweet as well. Or even better, an option to at least resize your trainer with customization so you don't always look like a midget with every other ""adult"" character you face in the game.I'd like to see genderless Pokemon be able to breed at least with other genderless types of the same species, fairly ridiculous Ditto is still the only option after all this time. That would also open up my next suggestion of breedable legendaries, so that way you don't have to SR for ages (even with 3 guaranteed 31 IVs that's still a substantial amount of resetting).Guess the other main thing for me would be more content to do after the main story ends. Considering the original RSE games had a whole fun area of different battle styles and themes with the original Battle Frontier, it really pissed me off that all they did was lazily transpose the Battle Maison (which I never liked) from XY to ORAS; they couldn't even bother making new maison girls, just the ones from XY are now ""visiting"". And of course, the most weirdest part is that it basically established ORAS as a prequel to the original RSE as the dev's lazy excuse was that Battle Frontier was being built, Pike Queen Lucy even has a cameo. Which really messes with any storyline when you consider primal forms or their lore are nowhere to be found in RSE of course.Anyways rant aside, I've always liked the GSC/HGSS way of linking it to another game area with Kanto/Johto and letting you collect that area's 8 badges and then having a showdown with the original champ, Red. Or again, a revisit of the original Battle Frontier facilities (or I guess the Subway) would be cool. The World Tournament in BW2 was also sweet in letting you download and facing off against the actual WC teams from that year, was kinda disappointing that only turned into a 1 year thing even though BW2 lasted long enough to warrant a second update. And being able to face Gym Leaders and E4 members of all generations was also a nice touch. But really, anything than the old standard of a Battle Tower (or worse, a shrunken version called the Battle Maison) would be great to have.Also give back Steel its Dark and Ghost resists. The loss of those 2 resistances really hurt the type even when it was made one of the SE options vs Fairies. They were never overpowering resistances to have in the first place given how more uncommon than not attacking ghost/dark Pokemon are, and it made Pokemon like poor Metagross a lot harder to use now that they're being hit for SE damage instead of neutral."
2016-04-05T11:52:06-0700,"Hey, you know, I was just thinking that we've had quite a number of pokemon that look like cats of some sort - some of which are decent to have. However pokemon that look like dogs are less and are kinda useless. How about givin some dogs some love? Ummm, I suppose that could have been said better, but you know what I mean."
2016-04-08T01:56:47-0700,More cat and dog Pokemon would be nice but I would like to see more bird and sea life. Seems appropriate for the games location.
2016-04-08T09:48:50-0700,"It would be interesting (to me anyways) to see a part of the game that is Pokken style included into S/M. An area of the game you can go into and fight Pokken style. You could earn things like Rare Candies, pp up, ect..........You could earn IV Capsules to use on a Pokemon to boost or decrease an IV stat of your choice."
2016-04-09T10:33:59-0700,Would be nice but it means they would have to model the Pokemon for a fighting game and give them all movesets. I dont think they will do that.
2016-04-16T11:08:38-0700,"Looking at Magearna's design and type- it looks like you breed a Klinklang and Diance together-I know that it was stated that at least 10 new Pokemon will be added to the full dex, I wonder if there will be a more blended typing through breeding that will be the bigger focus this time around to give older Pokemon the boost they need............."
2016-02-29T09:14:21-0800,"So what do you think we will see in the new games that come out this Fall?What would you like to see in the games?I would like to see a metal Eeevee evolution. Have Eevee hold the Metal Coat hold item and breed it with Mawile.Possible name for the metal type Eevee I would like to see: Mercureon ( after the planet Mercury, since the games have the theme)-Breeding with Legendary Pokémon to get either new type combos like Electric + Psychic type or the sort.This of course is early speculation, but trying to generate discussion is all. The only info out about the new games so far is the Man-made Diance + Klink ""hybrid/fusion"" (just using those words for description of how I see the image) Pokémon-Anyways, speak your thoughts! Speculate!"
2016-02-29T20:52:50-0800,"Well, I hear the bird is a woodpecker so I'll enjoy it. Its also rumored that the fire starter is a peacock. I just hope it stays that way and not turn into a bird person."
2016-03-01T09:40:36-0800,"I have soooo many ideas I'd like to see - literally, as the name of the games suggest, the sky's the limit! As of late I was seriously considering not picking up my pokemon games again - they've gotten stale. Don't get me wrong, I have all the latest games (B, W, Ruby, Sapphire, Alpha, Omega, X, Y .... and a few others including old Pokemon Box!). I've loved many different aspects of lots of them. Maybe the cure for my apathy is an expansion that not only has some new pokemon, and Mega pokemon, perhaps even some new types like ""light"" or ""gas"" (gotta catchem' all!), but an expansion that also EXPANDS from what they already built upon. It would be nice to be able to dig to the underground again, or the lost zone, grow berries and create pokeblocks that help your pokemon learn never before possible moves - or the ability to actually have 5 moves instead of 4. How about the ability to explore ALL the regions? How about the ability to liberate mistreated pokemon from bad owners and bring them back to the light? How about being able to fuse pokemon together? Oh man, this could seriously turn into a post that no one reads in it's entirety! I better stop for now. More later."
2016-03-01T11:55:19-0800,"Couldn't help myself. Had to put up another post!How about chances to battle people who have more than just a few pokemon (like maybe 5 or 6) earlier in the game? Berries that can randomly change your type, but when used with the right ingredients in a pokeblock (or pokepotion) gain the ability to change to a specific type for a battle (or a day, or maybe even permanently!) Or how about being able to change your ability (power) to another? (yes, I know that can be done now with the right item, but how about an easier way to do it?) How about having giveaways of special pokemon (special types/movesets/abilities) to those who contribute to the pokemon community - like LO's, LL's, TO's, PTO's, professors with over 100 lifetime points, pokemon website owners/ helpers? How about a loyalty giveaway to those who can produce 10 copies of different pokemon games? How about an even better giveaway for those who can produce 20 or more? More later."
2016-03-01T20:31:03-0800,"All I ask is that they finally get rid of that 2x2 square grid. That is ancient, atrocious game design that Square ditched over 20 years ago in pretty much the same type of game.As an Organizer, I'd like them to give us some sort of decent VGC prizes. Download codes, or something similar, for unique Pokemon, like that Pachi that won Worlds last year. But especially a more robust hack checking utility that can be used effectively within the time constraints of a standard tournament. The former would drive attendance. The latter would help keep the players they already got."
2016-03-02T05:44:56-0800,"How about more bird pokemon? More sky battles? More inverse battles for sure! Battles where you have a time limit? More puzzles? Yeah, I would like any and all of those things."
2016-03-02T14:12:15-0800,"Getting rid of the ""grid-walking"" would be nice. The 3DS can do so much, it seems it would be a sin if they didn't use the system (or NX when it is released) to it's fullest potential.Battle mechanics could use an upgrade, with Pekken being out- that-would-be-Awesome to see the battles done in that style (turn-based, that is going to be hard to ditch for Stat reasons).Gym Leader battles could be more intense. Instead of having to defeat them in order to advance in the story mode, the gyms could ""advance in level"" as your Pokémon leveled up.So many ways to get a Pokémon to evolve (heck, we have one that evolves when you hold your system up-side-down)- what if a Pokémon where to evolve (besides mega in battle) when you use a specific attack during the battle? And it stays permanent after the battle?Rotom- could use some more evo'sCastform- a sand form?Types I would like to see more of:SteelDarkFightingFairyZygard- all those forms, seems to me Legends could use altered/less base stat ""mini's"" for battles.A boost (non mega) to a good handful of Pokémon so that they can be tourney worthy to boost the battle roster."

2016-02-06T15:44:05-0800,"there are a few glitches you can do in the games in order to get mew. no outside device is needed, you can find many articles on this using the keywords Pokemon Blue and Red Mew glitch."
2016-02-08T16:23:12-0800,My favorite one is turning the game to an Hex Editor using the item bag and just accessing its hex value. Good times were had.
2016-04-04T01:03:12-0700,"I always thought it was more fun going through the elaborate steps to force an encounter outside of one of the routes. Remember Mew was added in last second and completely untested, so there's multiple ways to get it. Though having never bothered getting the new versions on the e-shop, I couldn't tell you if any of the old glitches were patched or not."

2015-09-17T22:07:36-0700,"This is just for discussion, something I think would be cool to have added into the Pokémon games.I will start off with asking: What do you think about fusing Pokemon together to get a new Pokémon?Not like mixing the designs from two Pokémon together, but getting say a Fire + psychic type from breeding two (say Torchic and Solosis) to make a new Pokémon? No resemblances from the two at all.I think that you could take two Pokémon, take them to someplace in a new game, like near the breeding house- place two Pokémon in there, and, receive a fused Pokémon in return.I base this thought on how Zygarde has ""%"" forms, which this information came out recently.IMO, there needs to be an addition to the Fairy, Steel, Dark, and Poison Pokémon lists. Perhaps Ice as well.This would generate new Pokémon, a new mechanic, and, some good possible combinations to mix things up a bit. And it could not only bring in new Pokémon, but it will make use of some Pokémon that don't really get that much use in so many cases.Not that the Fused Pokémon would be huge power-house Pokémon, the base stats and move sets could be adjusted to make them competitive and passive.What do you all think?"
2015-09-18T03:30:34-0700,"Bring it on! Would be a breath of fresh air in a somewhat stagnating game series. Don't get me wrong, I still love the games, but with each new iteration I find less and less exciting new content. It might also be interesting to be able to breed and/or fuse ""prime"" pokemon."
2015-09-18T11:41:08-0700,"It would be awesome to get say for example an Ice/Fire type from a fusion result. Perhaps taking Normal types and fusing them with single-type such as Fire (even though Pyroar is Normal/Fire along with a small handful of others which are Normal/???)- this could expand typing and give the boost in variety to the battle scene.Abilities could be expanded as well- the fused Pokémon could take on one or the other abilities from the Original two Pokémon. Or there could be a new ability for it in which it could only have that ability from the result of the fusion process.Primal Fusion sounds great, don't get me wrong- but I do not want to see more power-house legends. Perhaps if you do fuse say Primal Groudon with a compatible fuseing Pokémon, your result would be a mini-mix version of the legend that adds a second typing to it, like Electric/Ground. Alhough it would be sorta cool to see Rayquaza + Groudon blend."
2015-09-18T16:40:15-0700,"I was thinking of an idea where you could cross breed pokemon for stats and typing, like if you bred a pidgeot with a zapdos, you could get a pidgey with lightning attack and it becomes part electric."
2015-09-18T17:17:58-0700,"That wouldn't be bad either. I think it might be hard to code all these changes into a game - but perhaps deleting all the excess crap - errrr, excuse me, .... stuff, like costumes (pants, shoes, shirts, hats, bags) out of the game might give enough room to make some interesting changes."
2015-09-18T20:57:38-0700,A 3ds game cart has a max of 8bg on it so they can add all the stuff they would like.
2015-09-19T17:24:49-0700,"Well, I honestly have no idea how much room it might take, but allowing for all the permutations sounds like a lot. If they take the time and effort to do this right, there's a lot of money to be made - considering how many people appreciate the series already."
2015-09-21T11:34:33-0700,"Look at how many Pokémon have potential as it is if a few things changed such as Base Stat levels. Abilities sometimes do no justice for it if it does have good Base Stats making it not competitive-playable. I understand that not every Pokémon is supposed to be battle worthy (in game in story mode it comes in handy, but only to get you through the story mode)- but out of the 720 available only a handful make the cut (including taking out legendries makes that list even shorter).If GF does introduce a new mechanic to boost Pokémon to a higher status of being useable for competition besides a new form or evolution- them meta would get the breath of fresh air it needs to not become stale.Fusing or even cross-breeding could mix it up so much, it will not only open the list for more anticipatable Pokémon to be used for competitions but expand on the strategy level as well.Considering that it could be in December that we get the new format rules like previously done, the only thing I see that could be able to change up what we have now that GF could do is to release Gen 7 to really boost the scene from what it is now. To me, adding in new Pokémon is great and all, but, something needs to be done to change the game in a way that opens up more strategy besides singling out certain Pokémon to be battle worthy on the current system we have now.I love the games, don't get me wrong- but adding new forms or adding just a new batch where only 4 or 5 (and legends that will not be allowed to battle) are worth using is not going to keep me interested in the competitive scene much longer. Even though this is an idea to be able to cross-breed or fuse, I just do not know what could shake it up so much that it is not only impressive, but competitive changing on a level that really gives team building that fun factor that is already there but fading fast due to repetitiveness and the lack of available battlers we have now."
2015-09-21T13:08:32-0700,It would be more of a type replacement rather than changing the model any. Pidgeot would become Electric/Flying rather than its Normal/Flying. We already had a electric pidgeot in the TCG so this is one I would like to see.
2015-10-03T09:58:39-0700,"I also think it would be good if we could de-fusion the pokemon as well. My reasoning is that if you have raised a particular pokemon through breeding and effort values, and are only using it to get a particular fusion pokemon, it may have times where you need that particular pokemon back to make another specific pokemon. So I'd never want them to be locked in after a fusion."
2015-10-04T13:03:17-0700,That would be nice. Its so annoying to have to re-breed a pokemon just because you want a different hidden power.

2015-06-17T00:24:46-0700,"Is there a Pokémon you would like to see become a Mega Evolution Pokémon? If so, what Pokémon would it be and why?Absol being one of my favorite Pokémon got the blessing of having a Mega evolution option to it, so it leaves me with a few Pokémon I would like to see gain the status of being Mega form. I know a lot of people would like to see Flygon receive the treatment, so add me in on that wish as well.Cryogonal would be nice to see it gain the Mega form option. It does have a great special defense stat, which 405 max stat is not something to over look if you are looking for a great wall. It does get dual screens for doubles, and a not too bad of a move pool for being a reasonable contender- but, it lacks in attack and defense stats so much it really does not fit into teams much because the two stats leave you stuck and struggling if you cant get the perfect opposing team that can take the hits and physically attack back. Other Pokémon easily get chosen over Crogonal for many reasons.It's ability is situational, most of the attacks it has in the physical stat department are decent- but won't hit hard. Speed wise, it is fast, but you need to invest ev's into it- which, well, is better placed else where to benefit from the special defense and special attack areas. Cryogonal is greta in the right format or facing against other POemon that are in it's battle bracket- but I would love to see it gain the Mega treatment.Boost up it's defense, a little in the hit point section, a boost into attack and a small kick to the special attack stat- toss in an ability that is not situational- this would be a Pokémon worth using in the battle field for adding into the current Mega list we have now.Well, that's just one for now, but-What about you? Which Pokémon do you think should get the Mega treatment?"
2015-06-18T13:46:31-0700,I think Zangoose really needs one but I think all mega Pokemon who can mega evolve should have a base stat increase before they mega.

2015-03-22T17:03:26-0700,"For those of you who don't know, the way that TCG and VGC award ranking-based Worlds invites is different. Until recently, TCG used the same system that VGC currently uses: top 40 in a certain region (i.e. North America). However, they have now changed their system to where everyone who reaches a certain level of CP (which is currently 300) gets an invite. With the threshold being 300 CP, top players are already clinching their invite. Obviously, this system ultimately allows for more people to participate in Worlds.Do you think VGC will eventually switch to a similar system?"
2015-03-31T22:55:55-0700,"Doubtful unless the game really expands, VGC events and opportunities for earning CP are a lot more limited than constant TCG league challenges, cities, states, regionals, nats.Besides just getting an invite doesn't mean a lot of those players will go to worlds since they don't include travel costs or anything right? I'm sure there's probably quite a few invites that go unclaimed or given up."

2014-09-30T12:46:03-0700,"When the 2015 Winter Regionals arrive, the rules will reflect any changes that are made to accomodate the release of the ORAS games. Until then, the '14 pre-ORAS rules still ban the use of Mewtwo, Yveltal, Zygarde, Xerneas, and Diance."

2014-09-30T18:49:21-0700,"Lol. I just don't like the native rule because of how long its takes to raise pokemon. With school, a movie project and work, I just dont have time to rebreed pokemon. Plus heat wave pidgeot and zapdos are nice."
2014-10-01T06:30:56-0700,"Actually, the rules do include ""banned"" Pokemon - just not by name.""Players may only use Pokémon from the Central Kalos Pokédex from #001 to #150, Coastal Kalos Pokédex from #001 to #153, or Mountain Kalos Pokédex from #001 to #147.""This list excludes Diancie (Central #151), Xerneas (Mountain #148), Yveltal (Mountain #149), Zygarde (Mountain #150) and Mewtwo (Mountain #151) because of their dex numbers."
2014-10-01T09:07:04-0700,Thats a bit too complicated. Not even I know the Pokedex that way. Its far easier for everyone to just see the list of pokemon they can't use by name.
2014-10-01T10:03:14-0700,"Trust me, I don't know the Pokedex either - but I imagine that excluding the list is to simplify the process of updating the rules. For example, when they first issued Kalos-based rules (January '14 or so) - no one ""knew"" about Diancie yet. So calling it out by name would be a no-no, but omitting it would mean having to re-issue the rules when Diancie was discovered/announced."
2014-10-07T06:40:41-0700,"I don't mind the Kalos bred, blue pentagon, rule. The only thing this really removes is move tutor moves, which could lead to OR/AS bringing some move tutors back.It really does not take that long to breed anymore if you have a group of friends that breed also.With the Destiny Knot and time machine breeding you can really breed a 5x31 IV Pokémon within 1-3 eggs.I have a pretty deep collection of IV bred and I have two Ditto with 4x31 IVs that really speeds up breeding time.I would look into time machine breeding if you are looking to speed the breeding process up further."
2014-12-10T03:04:50-0800,What is time machine breeding?
2014-12-10T12:01:57-0800,I think it involves sending over 6IV pokes for breeding in the new games. The problem is I use a lot of pokemon with Hidden Power and they take forever to get.

2014-09-30T18:49:21-0700,"Lol. I just don't like the native rule because of how long its takes to raise pokemon. With school, a movie project and work, I just dont have time to rebreed pokemon. Plus heat wave pidgeot and zapdos are nice."
2014-10-01T06:30:56-0700,"Actually, the rules do include ""banned"" Pokemon - just not by name.""Players may only use Pokémon from the Central Kalos Pokédex from #001 to #150, Coastal Kalos Pokédex from #001 to #153, or Mountain Kalos Pokédex from #001 to #147.""This list excludes Diancie (Central #151), Xerneas (Mountain #148), Yveltal (Mountain #149), Zygarde (Mountain #150) and Mewtwo (Mountain #151) because of their dex numbers."
2014-10-01T09:07:04-0700,Thats a bit too complicated. Not even I know the Pokedex that way. Its far easier for everyone to just see the list of pokemon they can't use by name.
2014-10-01T10:03:14-0700,"Trust me, I don't know the Pokedex either - but I imagine that excluding the list is to simplify the process of updating the rules. For example, when they first issued Kalos-based rules (January '14 or so) - no one ""knew"" about Diancie yet. So calling it out by name would be a no-no, but omitting it would mean having to re-issue the rules when Diancie was discovered/announced."
2014-10-07T06:40:41-0700,"I don't mind the Kalos bred, blue pentagon, rule. The only thing this really removes is move tutor moves, which could lead to OR/AS bringing some move tutors back.It really does not take that long to breed anymore if you have a group of friends that breed also.With the Destiny Knot and time machine breeding you can really breed a 5x31 IV Pokémon within 1-3 eggs.I have a pretty deep collection of IV bred and I have two Ditto with 4x31 IVs that really speeds up breeding time.I would look into time machine breeding if you are looking to speed the breeding process up further."
2014-12-10T03:04:50-0800,What is time machine breeding?
2014-12-10T12:01:57-0800,I think it involves sending over 6IV pokes for breeding in the new games. The problem is I use a lot of pokemon with Hidden Power and they take forever to get.
2014-09-29T21:55:32-0700,"I was reading over the rules for 2015 VCG Tournaments and I noticed something or at less I could not find it. A list of Pokemon that are Banned.Last time Mewtwo, Xerneas, Yveltal, Zygarde, and Diancie were banned but I am unable to find this list under the current rules posted.Does this mean they are legal now or is there a mess up on the rules on pokemon.com"
2014-09-30T12:46:03-0700,"When the 2015 Winter Regionals arrive, the rules will reflect any changes that are made to accomodate the release of the ORAS games. Until then, the '14 pre-ORAS rules still ban the use of Mewtwo, Yveltal, Zygarde, Xerneas, and Diance."
2014-09-30T13:55:40-0700,"I looked up on Pokemon.com as well for the rules and they did not list any banned Pokemon. Not sure why this would change but maybe they are looking into a different rule set. I would still say use 2014 rules.On a side note, I want to see the Kalos Native rule to go away.

2014-06-02T18:45:09-0700,"So- with new games around the corner and some possible new stuff on the way-Who can't resist a bit of speculation or hears rumors?This is where we can stick all that sort of discussion for now, because, we all know that as the time draws closer to new games- there is speculation and rumors abound.Whether it is real (which will get ""filtered out"" in time, but- let's just toss around some simple discussion and maybe have a bit of fun in speculating what we can see or will have in the up coming games Pokémon Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire:so...................... I think it would be awesome to have the return of:Secret baseson-line underground spelunkingand- some 7th Gen Pokémon to expand on balancing out the types a bit more as far as numbers go.A town in the game that is on-line wi-fi interactive where you can battle, trade, and do a few other things that the town is really a ""live"" town- where players actually ""visit"" in the town and can interact with players like walking around a real town is.What do you guys think?What would you like to see?Ideas?Feel free to speculate or express what you think will be in the next games!"
2014-06-03T11:28:07-0700,"Well I want to see a Mega Pidgeot and the one thing everyone would care about is faster surfing. What would be cool is a overworld flying mode. I would like more good move tutors. Would be nice to visit all regions. However this is wishful thinking. We all know its going to be more of the same, just another 40 buck game where we get 8 badges and fight bad guys."
2014-06-03T13:19:35-0700,"Hey, you never know, maybe it'll be a 50 buck game where you can get 16 badges and fight bad guys? LOL.Yeah, I'd like to see the return of secret bases, mind you, I'd like to see more content there. It would be nice to be able to call up people from your secret base and have a battle, call up your ""friends"" from your friend code and do a mini safari game, or a catch-em-all competition, or maybe use that base as an avenue to call up pokemon from an earlier game. It would also be cool to make more use of farming berries - maybe even underwater berries where you have to fend off certain pokemon that love to eat them, and the use of underwater caves. Perhaps even more content after you learn how to climb rocks, and dive? I doubt this would happen, but it would be nice to see the use of cross-breeding, and more of the mechanic that made Black and White Kyurem. I'm sure on the average, most current pokemon game owners will jump at the chance for another adventure, but this could be a game with so much more than the standard - using online capabilities as well - possibly making it into the facebook of the pokemon world. How about maybe giving previews of who your next gym battle will be with, and what kind of battles you'll face there, so you can catch specific pokemon to help you out if you so desire. How about level of difficulty instead of just playing the game as is? How about letting a pokemon follow you through the game (or not) if you desire, a la pokemon yellow? And if you do end up letting a pokemon out of it's pokeball, when another pokemon touches it (instead of you), you can battle, or talk as well. Better communication between you and your pokemon .... how about fatigue like another person suggested in another thread? How about finding bully pokemon that you have to try to tame? Bully trainers that you have to try to liberate their pokemon from? How about the return of dark pokemon?, and maybe even the birth of a new type of pokemon - light pokemon? Pokemon X and Y brought the fractured pokedex - how about doing a rock/paper/scizor thing with this pokedex so that regardless of what type the pokemon is, they have a minor advantage over another specific region (as an explanation maybe there's just something in the water in a particular region, and something else which gives a disadvantage to another region). How about bringing back more time of year and weather effects? How about bringing in a map where you aren't constrained to going down a specific path but can wander aimlessly from any point of the compass - but only with the right conditions. There would be certain obstacles that you would need to learn to overcome - like brambles that poison YOU and your pokemon if you try to go through them where you need a specific pokemon in your party to either eat the obstacle or heal you and your pokemon, fences that you need a Gogoat for, and the usual high wall or water crossing that you need the requisite moveset to overcome. That way you could learn where you need to go by your experiences - if you wander into an area that has significantly higher level pokemon and your pokemon all faint you go back to your last pokemon center and choose a different path. Eventually you still will need the 8 badges to challenge the pokemon league. How about more tm's and the ability to use 5 moves instead of 4? Button combo moves? How about instead of turn based moves, you have the option to use the speed of the reaction of the player to base the attack on - such as if the player is quick to input what would normally be a slow move, it still attacks before something like Extreme speed, or Quick attack, due to the fast input of the attack. How about continued use of the Horde mechanic - possibly expanded to being able to catch more than one pokemon at a time if you have enough of the right pokeballs to do so - or maybe even one or two of the horde pokemon with slightly higher stats or levels, or the ability to flee. How about fitness based experiences as well - for example, if you treat a pokemon well, and make sure it's used a lot, it makes a better companion and more useable pokemon in battle, but if you don't feed it regularly it becomes underweight and it's stats suffer, or overfeed it and less exercise and it becomes too slow and the stats suffer. We've already seen some customization for trainers with outfits and accessories and such, but how about customizable music selection, and the ability to listen to your own music in your travels? And how about more rewards - possibly even more usable in-game items, collectable badges or certificates for achievements? How about wider results and outcomes based upon your responses to the game? Addition of more puzzles. No matter how this goes, I just hope they take advantage of any opportunity to make it a really great game."
2014-06-03T13:43:34-0700,"Great but straining post PA. That post is why I consider Gold and Silver the best of the series. It had a lot and did everything right for its time, with HGSS using the updated system. I expect the ""core"" of RS to remain he same but improved on, like the secret base. It would be nice to see difficulty to return to the game. Removing something like a poisoned pokemon taking 1 damage every 4 or 6 steps or the hunger system from the PMD game changes the game on a large scale. It's a small change but affects gameplay because you can take your time and not have to deal with the ""timer""Rather than use the same system of collect badges and fight the bad guy, why not do something different? I heard somewhere they GameFreak was looking to change the battle system. Would be nice to see it."
2014-06-14T10:43:04-0700,"I know one thing, I'm gonna breed up the best darn Mawile I can, here on my pokemon X game so I can use it on ORAS."
2014-06-14T21:49:55-0700,"With wifi now, if they can't do secret bases justice, that would be a shame."
2014-06-16T17:01:30-0700,"Yeah, and it would be nice to see secret bases in more than just underground places. Trees, buildings, under water ... all viable."
2014-06-16T18:42:37-0700,A underwater secret base would be sick.
2014-06-16T20:00:18-0700,how about using Fly to go up onto a cliff edge and have a secret base there?
2014-06-16T20:03:56-0700,"That would be cool to but birds dont get any love, just used."
2014-07-08T18:20:16-0700,"Ok, so we now know that secret bases are definitely returning. We just need to know a bit more about them."
2014-07-10T13:18:47-0700,Heard that mega Metagross is confirmed. Don't know the source. I hope so since I really like that pokemon.
2014-07-10T18:09:49-0700,"^ confirmed through Coro Coro leaks. But I'm excited, as Metagross has always been a favorite of mine, and a mega form for it is sweet. I don't particularly care for the design (mostly because it looks pretty lazy on their part, just flipping over the legs and giving him a pointy goatee), but eh, you don't use a Pokemon for looks, but for how good it is.One source says the mega ability will be Tough Claws...kinda hoping not honestly. Ok, it makes sense for him given the mega form pic, and it makes him a more fearsome sweeper especially since he can't be intimidated at the start, but what he - really - wants and needs is Levitate, especially since it gained 2 more weaknesses with the whole Steel type nerf this gen, so subtracting 1 is the least they can do."
2014-07-10T20:40:18-0700,"That design looks scary. Not sure why pokemon that dont need any boost are getting megas. Since Metagross is getting one, we can pretty much assume Mightyna is getting one. I also hope Zangoose gets one. Its needs the boost."
2014-07-12T13:06:46-0700,"Megas Garchomp and Scizor says hi, though that is kind of moot since they're rarely used over the base form anyways."
2014-07-12T16:37:03-0700,"I look forwards to them. When that Garchomp evolves and that base 102 speed drops to 80, I can get a free kill with Zapdos. Scizor has always been a free kill for me, even more so when my opponent didn't play in or understand GEN 4 and 5 meta.On a side note, Expert Belt Zapdos has been working really well for me."
2014-07-13T00:12:15-0700,"well-One thing that can be said about ""should this pokemon be a mega evolver or not"" is that when you look at the numbers is:718 pokemon18 typesthe total number of pokemon in a typethe number of dual type per the 18 single typesthe number of non-eligible VGC pokemonthe number of base stat battle worthy pokemon that can really be used in VGCthe move sets available for said VGC worthy pokemonabilities that are actually worth using in the VGCthe hold items that are worth using in VGCand the number of pokemon that can go mega--something will need to happen to raise the number of actual pokemon that can participate in the VGC out of the pokemon that don't fit the VGC scene criteria level of what is considered to be battle worthy if we are going to see a change in the meta.just as an example with no real numbers tossed in for factual but for reference:lets say there are only 700 pokemon (just rounding down for simplicity)of the 700, say 200 are not able to participate because they are legendary.500300 of those pokemon have such low base stats and pointless abilities that they have no real use in the VGC based upon the competitive level of what the VGC requires to be able to stand a chance in a competition level.20050 mega evolve, but only 25 actually are worth VGC battles17550 have such a bad dual typing and horrible move pools that makes them not able to stand a chance due to one too many weaknesses yet do have decent base stats to try to compete but are too frail to battle compared to the remaining pool of battle worthy pokemon.12550 pokemon have what it takes to compete- yet fail to pair nicely with other pokemon to make a strategy worth trying to use in the VGC.75your looking at perhaps 75 battle worthy pokemon, which these are the pokemon that will determin how the meta game goes.something other then giving pokemon the megavolution is needing to be done, or the game state of the VGC will be IMO ""stale""-let's hope that with the new games, some pokemon will get better base stats and better abilities to open up the VGC scene to a better playing state then just getting more megas and not a higher pool number to draw from for better battle strategies.edit---------------------I personally would love to see the number be at least 400 out of 700 be able to be battle worthy for the sake of mixing up the strategy options to break the meta's current state for the future of the VGC scene. This way there is little room of seeing the same pokemon be on the over used list for each coming year.Sure, there are those pokemon that work well for getting you through the game story mode and all, and makes it possible to beat the gym leaders and getting around and catching and breeding-but it seems rather saddening that only so many pokemon make it to be VGC worthy and only the higher base stated pokies with abilities that make them the only option for battles at that level."
2014-07-13T15:13:40-0700,"Thats the point of the weaker pokemon getting Megas, so they can be useable. Mawile had no use at all and it randomly gets a Mega though I think thats due to it getting new typing. Most of the Pokemon that got Mega's did not really need them so Im hoping some unique Pokemon get them this time around. Would love to see Mega Zangoose but seeing Mega Metagross saddens me a bit because I know the powercreep will grow stronger."
2014-07-13T17:25:06-0700,"Well, to be honest, we don't know how Metagross' stats will be affected, so getting to be a mega may not necessarily be a blessing. It's just more of a guess at the moment."
2014-07-13T20:07:20-0700,"Based on the art, I can tell its attack stat is going up. Based 135 to like maybe 160ish. We can assume its not getting weaker for sure with its mega. It may see a special stat drop or a dual 4x weakness. It may change to dark/metal or psychic/dark."
2014-07-14T04:44:48-0700,"I won't debate that you may indeed be right. Hey, who knows? Your guess at this point may be no more valid or invalid than anyone else. In fact I rather hope you ARE right. However, at this point, until the game arrives, there's a remote possibility you might get surprised. For that reason, I wouldn't start counting your chickens just yet. I could make fantastic claims right now and no one would be the wiser until release day. That's all I have to say on the subject.It's nice to find out a bit more on the ""Super"" secret bases. I like the fact that you can make them into a mini gym where people can battle you. I hope a lot of my friends do that instead of being a collector of dolls and such. However, to each his (or her) own."
2014-07-14T09:57:44-0700,Super secret base sounds fun. One thing I hope returns is letting your lead Pokemon walk around with you. Its not much of a needed change but its the small things that make the game fell more life like. Also would be nice if they did a dungeon crawling mode where you can find items with your Pokemon. Would be cool for a mini game.
2014-07-17T16:03:37-0700,"There's since been information that Metagross is going to get a big buff to its Speed (I'm guessing bumping up to the typical 100) and the rest of its stats are also going to be buffed, as well as getting Touch Claws as a new ability, additionally the same source also said Mega Diancie is going to lose defenses and pick up a lot in the speed and attack stats.In regards to Megas I'm excited for Mega Metagross and Swampert, both are bulky to begin with and have good movepools and typing, but I'm not sold on Mega Sableye or Mega Sceptile yet. Sableye losing prankster is a pretty big deal, and while it promises to become bulkier, I'm not convinced it's going to be enough to make it worthwhile. Sceptile's problem on the other hand has always been its movepool, focusing on physical attacks when its stats emphasize Special. I'm expecting Sceptile to pick up Dragon Pulse, but unless it gets something more that'll leave it at about 4 types for special attacks (including Hidden Power), and its ability while nice doesn't cover any of the major weaknesses its typing gives it."
2014-07-17T17:09:09-0700,"Sceptile already learns Dragon Pulse, right? I could have sworn I came across on that did it. With DP, Giga Drain, Hidden Power Fire and maybe Focus Blast, it would work well with Lightning Rod. Its may get faster. We can only wait to see if it gets anything else.Where is my mega pidgeot though. Thats what I really want."
2014-07-17T19:34:07-0700,"Yes, I did notice there had been some news about Metagross. Good to see it, since I used that, Deoxys, Rayquaza, Swampert, and Kyogre a lot when I was playing the original Sapphire game. Hopefully they'll give Rayquaza a mega as well. In any case, it's good to find out that vaporeon's suspicions were confirmed. I'm really looking forward to ORAS.LOL ..... On a side note, just to show you what's going on at our house, my son Josh (who is 25 this year) had me take him to EB Games to preorder the games. I assumed he was planning on preordering one of them for me. So I asked him which one he wanted for himself. He says to me, ""Both of course! Get your own, Dad!"" Apparently he really loved that pokemon set of games, so wants to play both when they come out this time. That's a first for us, since usually he gets one game and I get the other. So I guess I'll just have to buy both for me! Na na na! Take that annoying youngster!"
2014-07-17T19:45:51-0700,"Dragon Pulse is currently only a move tutor move from gen 5 sad to say, unless they give it Dragon Pulse it'll be stuck with Dragonbreath, but they've been throwing Dragon Pulse around a lot in XY, so it'll probably get it anyway. Even so, those 4 moves aren't enough to sell me on an attacker, especially when Dragon has little coverage and is now blocked by Fairies."
2014-07-17T20:45:31-0700,Yeah but 2 stab is good enough for the mega though since it will be hard to switch into... Even more so if it got the lightning rod boost. It would need a good fairy counter move though. I still have my Black 2 game so I should be able to get Dragon Pulse on mine. I did not know it was a tutor move. I thought it was a egg move. Thanks for letting me know that.
2014-08-13T16:45:03-0700,"So now we have more megas coming out. How many have been announced so far?MetagrossAudinoSlowbroSalamenceLopunnyAltariaDiancieMawileSableyeSwampertSceptileI guess Kyogre and Groudon aren't really considered megas, but they are going to see some changes as well.Any others I'm forgetting?"
2014-08-19T16:31:04-0700,"Mega Mawile is already outI think we're going to be getting a Mega Slaking as many prerelease shots have tended to include only Megas and the starters (with the exception of the E4 having Shiftry and Dusknoir), and Slaking is in some of the screenshots for Mega Slowbro."
2014-08-31T04:52:44-0700,I hope mega slaking will be awesome (if confirmed)
2014-09-01T15:40:23-0700,"MEGA MR. MIME!lol, nah- perhaps Mega Unown-I think that with some Pokémon getting Mega treatments, it is helping to balance out the games a bit more and adding Fairy types in IMO was a good move-now if the new 2014/15 VGC format gets announced, we'll see where the balance goes in favor of....................."
2014-09-06T20:24:18-0700,"In a recent bit by Pokemon Get TV, it was apparently revealed that the moves used by Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre are new moves. However their effects and names were not revealed. This reminds me though, we don't know what their abilities are yet."
2014-09-09T13:00:32-0700,"Do you think that maybe they're calling the new forms of Groundon and Kyogre ""Primal,"" it means that maybe there'll be a return of Primal Dialga and with it the Sinnoh region?"" If so, think of the battle music. If anybody has played MD2 and beaten it, they know what I'm talking about. Plus, Primal Giratina would look amazing and Primal Palkia might actually get a typing that makes sense. Maybe new type, such as Mystery or Cosmic. It would definitly give pokemon like Deoxys or Unknown something unique. Why is Deoxys a phychic, anyway? Shouldn't it be Electric-Phychic instead of just the plain Phychic? 'Cause that would make a lot more sense. Speaking of which, how about a Primal form of Deoxys? Too much? Probably."
2014-09-10T04:21:26-0700,"Primal Deoxys? Yummm! Doubt it, but definitely a nice dream. As for the rest .... I guess we won't know 'til later."
2014-09-10T14:06:28-0700,"The new Corocoro is leaking, which means we're getting the names of those attacks...although Kyogre's still hasn't been leaked yet.Primal Groudon gets ""Land of Endings"" as its ability and the attack ""Cliff Sword""Primal Kyogre gets ""Sea of Beginnings,"" and the attack as stated has not been leaked yet.These abilities summon ""strong sun"" and ""strong rain"" probably meaning infinite and maybe other effectsAlso 3 more Megas have been leaked, Gallade (no further info), Mega Sharpedo having Strong Jaw, and Mega Camerupt. Kinda sad to see that Wally's staple Pokemon is gonna be Gallade an not Gardey now, but I guess Diantha already stole that thunder"
2014-09-11T09:48:10-0700,"It's even sadder to think that Diantha's isn't really all that good. I'd say, if they were going to make the boss's pokemon decent they should make them a bit more of a challenge."
2014-09-12T20:22:27-0700,Heck- why not give the gym leaders pokies that can mega evolve and have a double battle to make it a bit more of a challenge-
2014-09-13T07:26:24-0700,"Why don't they make players gym leaders? Sure, that would be complicated but incredibly fun and challenging."
2014-09-15T04:43:46-0700,"Smeargle1, can you explain what you mean? I can't figure out how that would be done, other than by taking an opponent you played with and advancing their pokemon, and giving them the most devastating attacks. The problem with that is that sometimes an older learned attack sometimes is more effective - for example trick room. And how would you choose the players that become gym leaders? On second thought, maybe you should make a separate thread for that - I don't think it would really fit in this one."
2014-09-16T18:00:46-0700,"My guess on what Smeargle is saying is that it would be awesome if players could upload a team to the system and then another player would be able to download that team into the game as a gym battle.The hidden bases has that sort of a set-up that it is like a gym, where your friends are there to battle in I am guessing in a gym fashion.I think it would be awesome if there was a way to ""up-grade"" the gym leader's gym with downloads. Say you play through the game, get all the badges- defeat the E4- and, you would then be able to download the up-grade to each of the gyms. Different Pokémon and of course higher levels, and each time you go to the E4- there would be a successor to you who has come in after you and is the new champion.In a way it would be even better if there was like say 16 people who are on-line wifi battles for you to earn a badge from the wifi gym. They could have like 10 different teams at their disposal when challenged so that the battles are different every time if you have to rematch if you lost the match. That and not everyone who challenges them will face the same team. Personally, I like the idea but I highly doubt that something of that manner would happen. To me, wifi opens up so many ideas for Pokémon and how the games could be interactive with options other then trading and battles - like there could be a Pokémon universe mode that is a virtual world region set up like XD:GoD where it is a union area for the players to do all sorts of things."
2014-10-02T18:45:33-0700,"Oh now that's what I'm talkin about! Mega Rayquaza! Man I love that pokemon! The design is great and the upgrade makes it even better! Now I definitely can't wait! Have I used enough ! in this post? Na, I don't think so! Here's some more: !!!!!!!!!!"
2014-10-02T20:09:39-0700,I know. That ability would make my bird team OP! Too bad I'll likely have no chance to use it competitively.
2014-10-04T14:21:36-0700,"well- it might be possible that you'll be able to use that ability, Vaporeon. The '14/15 format has yet to be announced.I think the format will be (and I did say ""I think"") ORAS Pokedex combined with X/Y Pokedex, with a restriction to the legendries' list. And the normal no duplicate Pokémon, no duplicate hold item. Like, you'll be able to have ONE legendary in your party, but a ban on Pokémon like Celebi and a ban on the legendary that are not ORAS/X/Y. At least if I could say what the format is, this is what I would do.I think Staraptor would pair awesome with the new 'quazza, perhaps Talonflame would be awesome as well."
2014-10-04T15:11:52-0700,"Well, I would my Pidgeot but I'm also thinking they might allow 1 ""uber"" legendary as well and if they do, I would use mega rayquaza. I just want to know how the move works. I dont know if it removes weakness from flying types of if it makes them immune to rock, lightning and ice attack but only on the flying typing. if thats the case, I can make a team to abuse that ability."
2014-10-04T16:07:54-0700,"Well, to my understanding- the move removes any current weather status, and prevents any further weather changes that come in or are activated. It only keeps Flying type Pokémon from taking ""weakness"" damage, those attacks only do normal damage.The Flying types will definitely get a great boost in use for sure if 'quazza is allowed. So many good Flying Pokémon will get a chance to be on the VGC scene. Charizard will see even more use when paired with 'quazza.What I meant about only 1 legendary being used and Celebi being banned, I was saying that Celebi, Mew, Jirachi- those sort will be banned but you'll be able to use the ""mascot"" legends."
2014-10-04T20:38:19-0700,"Okay, I see. I really dislike selective rules like that. On the ability, for say articuno, would it still take weakness damage because of its ice type, so would stone edge deal 2x damage instead of 4x. Also, I hope they get rid of the native rule."
2014-10-05T18:13:07-0700,I'm also looking forward to see how the mega evolution of Rayquaza looks with my shiny Rayquaza as well.
2014-10-05T22:09:44-0700,Shiny 'quazza.............................................. droooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooolllllll-if it hadn't been ruby/sapphire and emerald- 'quazza should be black
2014-10-06T03:59:13-0700,Probably one of the coolest Megas in the series.
2014-10-06T16:13:17-0700,"I really wish they'd make megas of the pixies as well. They currently are a decent design, but with their stats, competitively they are a dead end in my opinion. I have regular and shiny versions of Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie also, so I'd like to see if anything can be done with them."
2014-10-14T18:12:08-0700,"Well, no pixies yet, but Steelix and Glalie are gonna be megas. Not sure if I like the Steelix one, but that Glalie was just what I would have pictured. Weird but cool."
2014-10-16T17:23:22-0700,"well- with the demos out, there is little room left for speculation, lol."
2014-10-17T04:54:57-0700,"True. Oh well, maybe next time."
2014-10-17T16:14:29-0700,"I'm not so sure, we still could get more Megas. I mean the coding isn't complete as evident by the level up moves for Pokemon like Blaziken apparently being only level 1 moves"
2014-10-17T17:32:08-0700,There are still Pokemon like Zangoose that could have megas. Im sure they make sure to keep data like that out of the demo but we'll see soon enough. I do wish the demo was a worldwide release though.
2014-10-19T07:24:33-0700,"Pretty radical form change to Hoopa though. Wouldn't have even known it was the same pokemon - if pics from the beach are correct. I agree with Fox_Master51 on the other thread - it would be nice to see a Mega Ninetales. However it would also be nice to see a Mega Zoroark, Quagsire, Muk, and Walrein. I've used those a lot over the years (edit: not competitively, but I have used them in the games)."
2014-11-10T04:34:47-0800,"In best Paul Revere voice: The new games are coming, the new games are coming!Yeah, I know it's kinda redundant at this point, but I just had to do it. 11 more days.It'll be kinda interesting to see if that Hunger Games movie will get anywhere near the money that pokemon will on that weekend.Hey, now you Americans will have something more to fight over on Thanksgiving weekend! LOL."
2014-11-10T10:11:50-0800,"Pokemon prints money. I wish I had something like that. On a side note, I was thinking what if Pidgeot had 2 megas. m pidgeot alpha and m pidgeot omega, both of which will specialize in physical and special attack. That would make my day."
2014-11-10T18:45:16-0800,"Well ..... now you're just dreamin' buddy. Life usually doesn't give out beautiful dreams like that. However, given that both Charizard AND Mewtwo both have 2 megas .... hey, you never know."
2014-11-10T22:29:24-0800,"Very true but the reason I say that is because it seems odd to give pidgeot a mega for special when it attack base stat is much higher, though not by much. It would make sense because of things like brave bird and other good egg moves. Either way, I have a pidgey ready for the game to play through with."
2014-11-14T02:55:21-0800,I'm just curious if there are going to be some restrictions with pokemon bank or some such thing to prevent people from trading over pokemon right away. I guess we'll hear about it as time gets closer.
2014-11-14T10:45:09-0800,I hope not. It does suck to play through pokemon game over and over. I have a pidgey I want to send over.
2014-11-15T18:15:51-0800,"There really hasn't been anything inhibiting trades since FRLG as far as I'm aware (maybe HGSS with DPPt), only restrictions regarding cross-gen, and even that isn't a thing in XY"
2014-11-15T20:57:40-0800,"Well- it hasn't been said on when at what point in the game Bank will be accessible. It could be right away or some time in the story mode.As far as trading over, it should be just after your able to obtain pokeballs. The demo gives you some, so it seems to me trading could happen after your first Pokemon center visit. There could be a restriction, like ""the system is in upgrade"" line like previous games, so who knows at this point.There should be no hassles with X/Y and ORAS in Bank use and ""normal"" trading."
2014-11-17T16:50:33-0800,"I am planning as if it is like x and y, so I am already building a team. I will be frustrated if we have to wait but I can quickly level them to what ever is needing in my X and Y."
2014-11-18T00:22:36-0800,I know for sure my team will have vaporeon and pidgeot in it. I may have a zangoose as well.
2014-11-18T03:19:09-0800,"You've piqued my interest - why would you possibly want vaporeon when you could use Swampert? Mega Swampert. Now Pidgeot, that I understand."
2014-11-18T09:06:29-0800,"There was the recent trailer for the 'Delta Episode' so it sounds like Pokemon 'Delta Emerald' is built-in for ORAS. Going into space with Mega-Rayquaza to fight Deoxys sounds very cool, but would you need to catch Rayquaza before this or does this allow the player to catch Rayquaza afterwards? Or is it like cover Pokemon in certain games where the player must catch the Legendary to progress (unless the PC box is full)? I'd hope that catching Rayquaza is a separate thing and we still get to climb the Sky Pillar to get him. As for the other legendary trios being in the game, it sounds pretty cool. However a lot of people are complaining about the game having too may Legendaries. It's quite the opposite of Pokemon X/Y which had fewer Legendaries than previous games. People are mentioning version exclusivity too. I'm putting it down now, I hate the way they made Legendary trios version exclusive and required owning both to get the third in gen 5. I would be a bit upset if they did these trios 5th gen style. However, Pokemon X/Y dealt with Legendary trios better. Some people may have complained about getting only one of the trio per game, but at least it's better that version exclusive trios. I hope that the legendary trios work in the same way as in X/Y. It can still retain the prestige of having all 3 of a trio. The option to trade for them is still available too. And people like me will play the game 3 times, banking Pokemon to get all 3 of a trio. Heck, it adds replayability with Pokemon Bank allowing us to carry our Pokemon over to new saves. So lets hope the trios are done as they are in Pokemon X/Y, heck it may even get them more subscribers for Pokemon Bank. Though we still can't keep items. That's my biggest complaint about Pokemon Bank.As for an ORAS team? I plan to play it through 3 times, with a different starter each time. I'll go serious on the last run, since I'll know the game after the first two times. So far its Sceptile, Groudon and Gallade for run 3 and of course, I'll breed them 5IV with natures and any egg moves, just because I enjoy breeding perfection. I am a perfectionist after all. I'll use Blaziken on run 2, but I feel like I should go the extra mile and breed a 5IV speedboost Torchic too, which won't take too long since I've already got perfect adamant Pokemon of it's egg group in the bank. I wonder if ORAS will still have the IV checker guy and how early would we be able to use him? As for other options, I'm considering Absol, since it's such a badass, but I used one on my first run of Pokemon Y and I want to use different Pokemon. Perhaps that Mega-Glalie would come in useful? I like to keep my options open with Mega's, especially as we can keep opponents guessing whether they'll actually go Mega or not. I'll have a couple of spare mint condition Groudon's up for trade as a result too. Speaking of which, would anyone want a mint Yveltal for a Xerneas? Actually, wrong place for that, sorry.I'm very busy these few weeks, therefore I'm unable to attend the Diancie event. Especially since it's so far away and I don't own a car. As such I've relied on my younger brother to get it on my game for me, hopefully it'll pull through like he did with Shiny-Gengar for the same reasons. I might even use it on one run if it's capable of interesting builds."
2014-11-18T09:34:52-0800,I like to start my new adventures with my favorites at lv 5. Chances are I'm going to put the starter in my pc. I still have the lv 5 torchic they gave away with its mega stone though so I may use that.
2014-11-18T15:04:20-0800,"Ah yes, hence the name. Got it.Mahius, if there are some items you want to keep, instead of sending all your pokemon to Pokemon Bank, you could always trade the pokemon over to a friend or relative's game, then trade back and still have the item available to you. That's what I plan on doing. I will still use Bank of course, but I don't plan on losing my items if I can help it. If I can help you, please let me know."
2014-11-19T00:32:31-0800,"Funny you said that. I actually traded most of my items over to my younger brother's copy Pokemon X after my first 2 play-throughs of Pokemon Y. He's got roughly a box full of my Pokemon & items, though it was previously 2 boxes. I've retrieved one lot so far and banked the Pokemon from it (it takes a while to catch trade-fodder & trade over). I don't think we can trade over Pokemon/items form ORAS to XY now can we? Though my brother did say he was planning on buying AS somehow. Won't really matter till Christmas, I'll take it easy with my first play-through and I can continue on Y if I have to wait for him to get his copy of AS. Or maybe... I have the perfect idea for a Christmas present... hehehe! Oh and as for my final team build, I've just remembered Mega-Salamence! I've got perfected Bagon's in the bank ready to rock, rumble and Mega-Evolve, I'd be a fool not to use one in OR. Especially since I've not used one recently in Pokemon. That's 4 spots in my final party taken up and since Treecko is in the Dragon egg-group, it's easier to breed a perfect one since I've already got Bagons and the like to breed the perfect IV's/natures in. I'm wondering whether they'll have the equivalent of Kalos cafe's to grind levels on in ORAS? Or I may just have to trade my Pokemon over to Y to maintain decent levels. Especially with teams of 6. Gah, I can't hold the excitement, just a week and a day away from having the game! Mega-Swampert here I come!One major question I have about game mechanics, which would likely be able to be answered in a couple of days, Sceptile can't learn Dragon Pulse on level up or TMs. Would there be a move tutor able to teach in in ORAS, cos we could do that in B2W2? I want to utilise that 105 Sp. A, along with Mega-Sceptile STAB if I can."
2014-06-02T18:45:09-0700,"So- with new games around the corner and some possible new stuff on the way-Who can't resist a bit of speculation or hears rumors?This is where we can stick all that sort of discussion for now, because, we all know that as the time draws closer to new games- there is speculation and rumors abound.Whether it is real (which will get ""filtered out"" in time, but- let's just toss around some simple discussion and maybe have a bit of fun in speculating what we can see or will have in the up coming games Pokémon Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire:so...................... I think it would be awesome to have the return of:Secret baseson-line underground spelunkingand- some 7th Gen Pokémon to expand on balancing out the types a bit more as far as numbers go.A town in the game that is on-line wi-fi interactive where you can battle, trade, and do a few other things that the town is really a ""live"" town- where players actually ""visit"" in the town and can interact with players like walking around a real town is.What do you guys think?What would you like to see?Ideas?Feel free to speculate or express what you think will be in the next games!"
2014-06-03T11:28:07-0700,"Well I want to see a Mega Pidgeot and the one thing everyone would care about is faster surfing. What would be cool is a overworld flying mode. I would like more good move tutors. Would be nice to visit all regions. However this is wishful thinking. We all know its going to be more of the same, just another 40 buck game where we get 8 badges and fight bad guys."
2014-06-03T13:19:35-0700,"Hey, you never know, maybe it'll be a 50 buck game where you can get 16 badges and fight bad guys? LOL.Yeah, I'd like to see the return of secret bases, mind you, I'd like to see more content there. It would be nice to be able to call up people from your secret base and have a battle, call up your ""friends"" from your friend code and do a mini safari game, or a catch-em-all competition, or maybe use that base as an avenue to call up pokemon from an earlier game. It would also be cool to make more use of farming berries - maybe even underwater berries where you have to fend off certain pokemon that love to eat them, and the use of underwater caves. Perhaps even more content after you learn how to climb rocks, and dive? I doubt this would happen, but it would be nice to see the use of cross-breeding, and more of the mechanic that made Black and White Kyurem. I'm sure on the average, most current pokemon game owners will jump at the chance for another adventure, but this could be a game with so much more than the standard - using online capabilities as well - possibly making it into the facebook of the pokemon world. How about maybe giving previews of who your next gym battle will be with, and what kind of battles you'll face there, so you can catch specific pokemon to help you out if you so desire. How about level of difficulty instead of just playing the game as is? How about letting a pokemon follow you through the game (or not) if you desire, a la pokemon yellow? And if you do end up letting a pokemon out of it's pokeball, when another pokemon touches it (instead of you), you can battle, or talk as well. Better communication between you and your pokemon .... how about fatigue like another person suggested in another thread? How about finding bully pokemon that you have to try to tame? Bully trainers that you have to try to liberate their pokemon from? How about the return of dark pokemon?, and maybe even the birth of a new type of pokemon - light pokemon? Pokemon X and Y brought the fractured pokedex - how about doing a rock/paper/scizor thing with this pokedex so that regardless of what type the pokemon is, they have a minor advantage over another specific region (as an explanation maybe there's just something in the water in a particular region, and something else which gives a disadvantage to another region). How about bringing back more time of year and weather effects? How about bringing in a map where you aren't constrained to going down a specific path but can wander aimlessly from any point of the compass - but only with the right conditions. There would be certain obstacles that you would need to learn to overcome - like brambles that poison YOU and your pokemon if you try to go through them where you need a specific pokemon in your party to either eat the obstacle or heal you and your pokemon, fences that you need a Gogoat for, and the usual high wall or water crossing that you need the requisite moveset to overcome. That way you could learn where you need to go by your experiences - if you wander into an area that has significantly higher level pokemon and your pokemon all faint you go back to your last pokemon center and choose a different path. Eventually you still will need the 8 badges to challenge the pokemon league. How about more tm's and the ability to use 5 moves instead of 4? Button combo moves? How about instead of turn based moves, you have the option to use the speed of the reaction of the player to base the attack on - such as if the player is quick to input what would normally be a slow move, it still attacks before something like Extreme speed, or Quick attack, due to the fast input of the attack. How about continued use of the Horde mechanic - possibly expanded to being able to catch more than one pokemon at a time if you have enough of the right pokeballs to do so - or maybe even one or two of the horde pokemon with slightly higher stats or levels, or the ability to flee. How about fitness based experiences as well - for example, if you treat a pokemon well, and make sure it's used a lot, it makes a better companion and more useable pokemon in battle, but if you don't feed it regularly it becomes underweight and it's stats suffer, or overfeed it and less exercise and it becomes too slow and the stats suffer. We've already seen some customization for trainers with outfits and accessories and such, but how about customizable music selection, and the ability to listen to your own music in your travels? And how about more rewards - possibly even more usable in-game items, collectable badges or certificates for achievements? How about wider results and outcomes based upon your responses to the game? Addition of more puzzles. No matter how this goes, I just hope they take advantage of any opportunity to make it a really great game."
2014-06-03T13:43:34-0700,"Great but straining post PA. That post is why I consider Gold and Silver the best of the series. It had a lot and did everything right for its time, with HGSS using the updated system. I expect the ""core"" of RS to remain he same but improved on, like the secret base. It would be nice to see difficulty to return to the game. Removing something like a poisoned pokemon taking 1 damage every 4 or 6 steps or the hunger system from the PMD game changes the game on a large scale. It's a small change but affects gameplay because you can take your time and not have to deal with the ""timer""Rather than use the same system of collect badges and fight the bad guy, why not do something different? I heard somewhere they GameFreak was looking to change the battle system. Would be nice to see it."
2014-06-14T10:43:04-0700,"I know one thing, I'm gonna breed up the best darn Mawile I can, here on my pokemon X game so I can use it on ORAS."
2014-06-14T21:49:55-0700,"With wifi now, if they can't do secret bases justice, that would be a shame."
2014-06-16T17:01:30-0700,"Yeah, and it would be nice to see secret bases in more than just underground places. Trees, buildings, under water ... all viable."
2014-06-16T18:42:37-0700,A underwater secret base would be sick.
2014-06-16T20:00:18-0700,how about using Fly to go up onto a cliff edge and have a secret base there?
2014-06-16T20:03:56-0700,"That would be cool to but birds dont get any love, just used."
2014-07-08T18:20:16-0700,"Ok, so we now know that secret bases are definitely returning. We just need to know a bit more about them."
2014-07-10T13:18:47-0700,Heard that mega Metagross is confirmed. Don't know the source. I hope so since I really like that pokemon.
2014-07-10T18:09:49-0700,"^ confirmed through Coro Coro leaks. But I'm excited, as Metagross has always been a favorite of mine, and a mega form for it is sweet. I don't particularly care for the design (mostly because it looks pretty lazy on their part, just flipping over the legs and giving him a pointy goatee), but eh, you don't use a Pokemon for looks, but for how good it is.One source says the mega ability will be Tough Claws...kinda hoping not honestly. Ok, it makes sense for him given the mega form pic, and it makes him a more fearsome sweeper especially since he can't be intimidated at the start, but what he - really - wants and needs is Levitate, especially since it gained 2 more weaknesses with the whole Steel type nerf this gen, so subtracting 1 is the least they can do."
2014-07-10T20:40:18-0700,"That design looks scary. Not sure why pokemon that dont need any boost are getting megas. Since Metagross is getting one, we can pretty much assume Mightyna is getting one. I also hope Zangoose gets one. Its needs the boost."
2014-07-12T13:06:46-0700,"Megas Garchomp and Scizor says hi, though that is kind of moot since they're rarely used over the base form anyways."
2014-07-12T16:37:03-0700,"I look forwards to them. When that Garchomp evolves and that base 102 speed drops to 80, I can get a free kill with Zapdos. Scizor has always been a free kill for me, even more so when my opponent didn't play in or understand GEN 4 and 5 meta.On a side note, Expert Belt Zapdos has been working really well for me."
2014-07-13T00:12:15-0700,"well-One thing that can be said about ""should this pokemon be a mega evolver or not"" is that when you look at the numbers is:718 pokemon18 typesthe total number of pokemon in a typethe number of dual type per the 18 single typesthe number of non-eligible VGC pokemonthe number of base stat battle worthy pokemon that can really be used in VGCthe move sets available for said VGC worthy pokemonabilities that are actually worth using in the VGCthe hold items that are worth using in VGCand the number of pokemon that can go mega--something will need to happen to raise the number of actual pokemon that can participate in the VGC out of the pokemon that don't fit the VGC scene criteria level of what is considered to be battle worthy if we are going to see a change in the meta.just as an example with no real numbers tossed in for factual but for reference:lets say there are only 700 pokemon (just rounding down for simplicity)of the 700, say 200 are not able to participate because they are legendary.500300 of those pokemon have such low base stats and pointless abilities that they have no real use in the VGC based upon the competitive level of what the VGC requires to be able to stand a chance in a competition level.20050 mega evolve, but only 25 actually are worth VGC battles17550 have such a bad dual typing and horrible move pools that makes them not able to stand a chance due to one too many weaknesses yet do have decent base stats to try to compete but are too frail to battle compared to the remaining pool of battle worthy pokemon.12550 pokemon have what it takes to compete- yet fail to pair nicely with other pokemon to make a strategy worth trying to use in the VGC.75your looking at perhaps 75 battle worthy pokemon, which these are the pokemon that will determin how the meta game goes.something other then giving pokemon the megavolution is needing to be done, or the game state of the VGC will be IMO ""stale""-let's hope that with the new games, some pokemon will get better base stats and better abilities to open up the VGC scene to a better playing state then just getting more megas and not a higher pool number to draw from for better battle strategies.edit---------------------I personally would love to see the number be at least 400 out of 700 be able to be battle worthy for the sake of mixing up the strategy options to break the meta's current state for the future of the VGC scene. This way there is little room of seeing the same pokemon be on the over used list for each coming year.Sure, there are those pokemon that work well for getting you through the game story mode and all, and makes it possible to beat the gym leaders and getting around and catching and breeding-but it seems rather saddening that only so many pokemon make it to be VGC worthy and only the higher base stated pokies with abilities that make them the only option for battles at that level."
2014-07-13T15:13:40-0700,"Thats the point of the weaker pokemon getting Megas, so they can be useable. Mawile had no use at all and it randomly gets a Mega though I think thats due to it getting new typing. Most of the Pokemon that got Mega's did not really need them so Im hoping some unique Pokemon get them this time around. Would love to see Mega Zangoose but seeing Mega Metagross saddens me a bit because I know the powercreep will grow stronger."
2014-07-13T17:25:06-0700,"Well, to be honest, we don't know how Metagross' stats will be affected, so getting to be a mega may not necessarily be a blessing. It's just more of a guess at the moment."
2014-07-13T20:07:20-0700,"Based on the art, I can tell its attack stat is going up. Based 135 to like maybe 160ish. We can assume its not getting weaker for sure with its mega. It may see a special stat drop or a dual 4x weakness. It may change to dark/metal or psychic/dark."
2014-07-14T04:44:48-0700,"I won't debate that you may indeed be right. Hey, who knows? Your guess at this point may be no more valid or invalid than anyone else. In fact I rather hope you ARE right. However, at this point, until the game arrives, there's a remote possibility you might get surprised. For that reason, I wouldn't start counting your chickens just yet. I could make fantastic claims right now and no one would be the wiser until release day. That's all I have to say on the subject.It's nice to find out a bit more on the ""Super"" secret bases. I like the fact that you can make them into a mini gym where people can battle you. I hope a lot of my friends do that instead of being a collector of dolls and such. However, to each his (or her) own."
2014-07-14T09:57:44-0700,Super secret base sounds fun. One thing I hope returns is letting your lead Pokemon walk around with you. Its not much of a needed change but its the small things that make the game fell more life like. Also would be nice if they did a dungeon crawling mode where you can find items with your Pokemon. Would be cool for a mini game.
2014-07-17T16:03:37-0700,"There's since been information that Metagross is going to get a big buff to its Speed (I'm guessing bumping up to the typical 100) and the rest of its stats are also going to be buffed, as well as getting Touch Claws as a new ability, additionally the same source also said Mega Diancie is going to lose defenses and pick up a lot in the speed and attack stats.In regards to Megas I'm excited for Mega Metagross and Swampert, both are bulky to begin with and have good movepools and typing, but I'm not sold on Mega Sableye or Mega Sceptile yet. Sableye losing prankster is a pretty big deal, and while it promises to become bulkier, I'm not convinced it's going to be enough to make it worthwhile. Sceptile's problem on the other hand has always been its movepool, focusing on physical attacks when its stats emphasize Special. I'm expecting Sceptile to pick up Dragon Pulse, but unless it gets something more that'll leave it at about 4 types for special attacks (including Hidden Power), and its ability while nice doesn't cover any of the major weaknesses its typing gives it."
2014-07-17T17:09:09-0700,"Sceptile already learns Dragon Pulse, right? I could have sworn I came across on that did it. With DP, Giga Drain, Hidden Power Fire and maybe Focus Blast, it would work well with Lightning Rod. Its may get faster. We can only wait to see if it gets anything else.Where is my mega pidgeot though. Thats what I really want."
2014-07-17T19:34:07-0700,"Yes, I did notice there had been some news about Metagross. Good to see it, since I used that, Deoxys, Rayquaza, Swampert, and Kyogre a lot when I was playing the original Sapphire game. Hopefully they'll give Rayquaza a mega as well. In any case, it's good to find out that vaporeon's suspicions were confirmed. I'm really looking forward to ORAS.LOL ..... On a side note, just to show you what's going on at our house, my son Josh (who is 25 this year) had me take him to EB Games to preorder the games. I assumed he was planning on preordering one of them for me. So I asked him which one he wanted for himself. He says to me, ""Both of course! Get your own, Dad!"" Apparently he really loved that pokemon set of games, so wants to play both when they come out this time. That's a first for us, since usually he gets one game and I get the other. So I guess I'll just have to buy both for me! Na na na! Take that annoying youngster!"
2014-07-17T19:45:51-0700,"Dragon Pulse is currently only a move tutor move from gen 5 sad to say, unless they give it Dragon Pulse it'll be stuck with Dragonbreath, but they've been throwing Dragon Pulse around a lot in XY, so it'll probably get it anyway. Even so, those 4 moves aren't enough to sell me on an attacker, especially when Dragon has little coverage and is now blocked by Fairies."
2014-07-17T20:45:31-0700,Yeah but 2 stab is good enough for the mega though since it will be hard to switch into... Even more so if it got the lightning rod boost. It would need a good fairy counter move though. I still have my Black 2 game so I should be able to get Dragon Pulse on mine. I did not know it was a tutor move. I thought it was a egg move. Thanks for letting me know that.
2014-08-13T16:45:03-0700,"So now we have more megas coming out. How many have been announced so far?MetagrossAudinoSlowbroSalamenceLopunnyAltariaDiancieMawileSableyeSwampertSceptileI guess Kyogre and Groudon aren't really considered megas, but they are going to see some changes as well.Any others I'm forgetting?"

2014-08-31T04:52:44-0700,I hope mega slaking will be awesome (if confirmed)
2014-09-01T15:40:23-0700,"MEGA MR. MIME!lol, nah- perhaps Mega Unown-I think that with some Pokémon getting Mega treatments, it is helping to balance out the games a bit more and adding Fairy types in IMO was a good move-now if the new 2014/15 VGC format gets announced, we'll see where the balance goes in favor of....................."
2014-09-06T20:24:18-0700,"In a recent bit by Pokemon Get TV, it was apparently revealed that the moves used by Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre are new moves. However their effects and names were not revealed. This reminds me though, we don't know what their abilities are yet."
2014-09-09T13:00:32-0700,"Do you think that maybe they're calling the new forms of Groundon and Kyogre ""Primal,"" it means that maybe there'll be a return of Primal Dialga and with it the Sinnoh region?"" If so, think of the battle music. If anybody has played MD2 and beaten it, they know what I'm talking about. Plus, Primal Giratina would look amazing and Primal Palkia might actually get a typing that makes sense. Maybe new type, such as Mystery or Cosmic. It would definitly give pokemon like Deoxys or Unknown something unique. Why is Deoxys a phychic, anyway? Shouldn't it be Electric-Phychic instead of just the plain Phychic? 'Cause that would make a lot more sense. Speaking of which, how about a Primal form of Deoxys? Too much? Probably."
2014-09-10T04:21:26-0700,"Primal Deoxys? Yummm! Doubt it, but definitely a nice dream. As for the rest .... I guess we won't know 'til later."
2014-09-10T14:06:28-0700,"The new Corocoro is leaking, which means we're getting the names of those attacks...although Kyogre's still hasn't been leaked yet.Primal Groudon gets ""Land of Endings"" as its ability and the attack ""Cliff Sword""Primal Kyogre gets ""Sea of Beginnings,"" and the attack as stated has not been leaked yet.These abilities summon ""strong sun"" and ""strong rain"" probably meaning infinite and maybe other effectsAlso 3 more Megas have been leaked, Gallade (no further info), Mega Sharpedo having Strong Jaw, and Mega Camerupt. Kinda sad to see that Wally's staple Pokemon is gonna be Gallade an not Gardey now, but I guess Diantha already stole that thunder"
2014-09-11T09:48:10-0700,"It's even sadder to think that Diantha's isn't really all that good. I'd say, if they were going to make the boss's pokemon decent they should make them a bit more of a challenge."
2014-09-12T20:22:27-0700,Heck- why not give the gym leaders pokies that can mega evolve and have a double battle to make it a bit more of a challenge-
2014-09-13T07:26:24-0700,"Why don't they make players gym leaders? Sure, that would be complicated but incredibly fun and challenging."
2014-09-15T04:43:46-0700,"Smeargle1, can you explain what you mean? I can't figure out how that would be done, other than by taking an opponent you played with and advancing their pokemon, and giving them the most devastating attacks. The problem with that is that sometimes an older learned attack sometimes is more effective - for example trick room. And how would you choose the players that become gym leaders? On second thought, maybe you should make a separate thread for that - I don't think it would really fit in this one."
2014-09-16T18:00:46-0700,"My guess on what Smeargle is saying is that it would be awesome if players could upload a team to the system and then another player would be able to download that team into the game as a gym battle.The hidden bases has that sort of a set-up that it is like a gym, where your friends are there to battle in I am guessing in a gym fashion.I think it would be awesome if there was a way to ""up-grade"" the gym leader's gym with downloads. Say you play through the game, get all the badges- defeat the E4- and, you would then be able to download the up-grade to each of the gyms. Different Pokémon and of course higher levels, and each time you go to the E4- there would be a successor to you who has come in after you and is the new champion.In a way it would be even better if there was like say 16 people who are on-line wifi battles for you to earn a badge from the wifi gym. They could have like 10 different teams at their disposal when challenged so that the battles are different every time if you have to rematch if you lost the match. That and not everyone who challenges them will face the same team. Personally, I like the idea but I highly doubt that something of that manner would happen. To me, wifi opens up so many ideas for Pokémon and how the games could be interactive with options other then trading and battles - like there could be a Pokémon universe mode that is a virtual world region set up like XD:GoD where it is a union area for the players to do all sorts of things."
2014-10-02T18:45:33-0700,"Oh now that's what I'm talkin about! Mega Rayquaza! Man I love that pokemon! The design is great and the upgrade makes it even better! Now I definitely can't wait! Have I used enough ! in this post? Na, I don't think so! Here's some more: !!!!!!!!!!"
2014-10-02T20:09:39-0700,I know. That ability would make my bird team OP! Too bad I'll likely have no chance to use it competitively.
2014-10-04T14:21:36-0700,"well- it might be possible that you'll be able to use that ability, Vaporeon. The '14/15 format has yet to be announced.I think the format will be (and I did say ""I think"") ORAS Pokedex combined with X/Y Pokedex, with a restriction to the legendries' list. And the normal no duplicate Pokémon, no duplicate hold item. Like, you'll be able to have ONE legendary in your party, but a ban on Pokémon like Celebi and a ban on the legendary that are not ORAS/X/Y. At least if I could say what the format is, this is what I would do.I think Staraptor would pair awesome with the new 'quazza, perhaps Talonflame would be awesome as well."
2014-10-04T15:11:52-0700,"Well, I would my Pidgeot but I'm also thinking they might allow 1 ""uber"" legendary as well and if they do, I would use mega rayquaza. I just want to know how the move works. I dont know if it removes weakness from flying types of if it makes them immune to rock, lightning and ice attack but only on the flying typing. if thats the case, I can make a team to abuse that ability."
2014-10-04T16:07:54-0700,"Well, to my understanding- the move removes any current weather status, and prevents any further weather changes that come in or are activated. It only keeps Flying type Pokémon from taking ""weakness"" damage, those attacks only do normal damage.The Flying types will definitely get a great boost in use for sure if 'quazza is allowed. So many good Flying Pokémon will get a chance to be on the VGC scene. Charizard will see even more use when paired with 'quazza.What I meant about only 1 legendary being used and Celebi being banned, I was saying that Celebi, Mew, Jirachi- those sort will be banned but you'll be able to use the ""mascot"" legends."
2014-10-04T20:38:19-0700,"Okay, I see. I really dislike selective rules like that. On the ability, for say articuno, would it still take weakness damage because of its ice type, so would stone edge deal 2x damage instead of 4x. Also, I hope they get rid of the native rule."
2014-10-05T18:13:07-0700,I'm also looking forward to see how the mega evolution of Rayquaza looks with my shiny Rayquaza as well.
2014-10-05T22:09:44-0700,Shiny 'quazza.............................................. droooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooolllllll-if it hadn't been ruby/sapphire and emerald- 'quazza should be black
2014-10-06T03:59:13-0700,Probably one of the coolest Megas in the series.
2014-10-06T16:13:17-0700,"I really wish they'd make megas of the pixies as well. They currently are a decent design, but with their stats, competitively they are a dead end in my opinion. I have regular and shiny versions of Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie also, so I'd like to see if anything can be done with them."
2014-10-14T18:12:08-0700,"Well, no pixies yet, but Steelix and Glalie are gonna be megas. Not sure if I like the Steelix one, but that Glalie was just what I would have pictured. Weird but cool."
2014-10-16T17:23:22-0700,"well- with the demos out, there is little room left for speculation, lol."
2014-10-17T04:54:57-0700,"True. Oh well, maybe next time."
2014-10-17T16:14:29-0700,"I'm not so sure, we still could get more Megas. I mean the coding isn't complete as evident by the level up moves for Pokemon like Blaziken apparently being only level 1 moves"
2014-10-17T17:32:08-0700,There are still Pokemon like Zangoose that could have megas. Im sure they make sure to keep data like that out of the demo but we'll see soon enough. I do wish the demo was a worldwide release though.
2014-10-19T07:24:33-0700,"Pretty radical form change to Hoopa though. Wouldn't have even known it was the same pokemon - if pics from the beach are correct. I agree with Fox_Master51 on the other thread - it would be nice to see a Mega Ninetales. However it would also be nice to see a Mega Zoroark, Quagsire, Muk, and Walrein. I've used those a lot over the years (edit: not competitively, but I have used them in the games)."
2014-11-10T04:34:47-0800,"In best Paul Revere voice: The new games are coming, the new games are coming!Yeah, I know it's kinda redundant at this point, but I just had to do it. 11 more days.It'll be kinda interesting to see if that Hunger Games movie will get anywhere near the money that pokemon will on that weekend.Hey, now you Americans will have something more to fight over on Thanksgiving weekend! LOL."
2014-11-10T10:11:50-0800,"Pokemon prints money. I wish I had something like that. On a side note, I was thinking what if Pidgeot had 2 megas. m pidgeot alpha and m pidgeot omega, both of which will specialize in physical and special attack. That would make my day."
2014-11-10T18:45:16-0800,"Well ..... now you're just dreamin' buddy. Life usually doesn't give out beautiful dreams like that. However, given that both Charizard AND Mewtwo both have 2 megas .... hey, you never know."
2014-11-10T22:29:24-0800,"Very true but the reason I say that is because it seems odd to give pidgeot a mega for special when it attack base stat is much higher, though not by much. It would make sense because of things like brave bird and other good egg moves. Either way, I have a pidgey ready for the game to play through with."
2014-11-14T02:55:21-0800,I'm just curious if there are going to be some restrictions with pokemon bank or some such thing to prevent people from trading over pokemon right away. I guess we'll hear about it as time gets closer.
2014-11-14T10:45:09-0800,I hope not. It does suck to play through pokemon game over and over. I have a pidgey I want to send over.
2014-11-15T18:15:51-0800,"There really hasn't been anything inhibiting trades since FRLG as far as I'm aware (maybe HGSS with DPPt), only restrictions regarding cross-gen, and even that isn't a thing in XY"
2014-11-15T20:57:40-0800,"Well- it hasn't been said on when at what point in the game Bank will be accessible. It could be right away or some time in the story mode.As far as trading over, it should be just after your able to obtain pokeballs. The demo gives you some, so it seems to me trading could happen after your first Pokemon center visit. There could be a restriction, like ""the system is in upgrade"" line like previous games, so who knows at this point.There should be no hassles with X/Y and ORAS in Bank use and ""normal"" trading."
2014-11-17T16:50:33-0800,"I am planning as if it is like x and y, so I am already building a team. I will be frustrated if we have to wait but I can quickly level them to what ever is needing in my X and Y."
2014-11-18T00:22:36-0800,I know for sure my team will have vaporeon and pidgeot in it. I may have a zangoose as well.
2014-11-18T03:19:09-0800,"You've piqued my interest - why would you possibly want vaporeon when you could use Swampert? Mega Swampert. Now Pidgeot, that I understand."
2014-11-18T09:06:29-0800,"There was the recent trailer for the 'Delta Episode' so it sounds like Pokemon 'Delta Emerald' is built-in for ORAS. Going into space with Mega-Rayquaza to fight Deoxys sounds very cool, but would you need to catch Rayquaza before this or does this allow the player to catch Rayquaza afterwards? Or is it like cover Pokemon in certain games where the player must catch the Legendary to progress (unless the PC box is full)? I'd hope that catching Rayquaza is a separate thing and we still get to climb the Sky Pillar to get him. As for the other legendary trios being in the game, it sounds pretty cool. However a lot of people are complaining about the game having too may Legendaries. It's quite the opposite of Pokemon X/Y which had fewer Legendaries than previous games. People are mentioning version exclusivity too. I'm putting it down now, I hate the way they made Legendary trios version exclusive and required owning both to get the third in gen 5. I would be a bit upset if they did these trios 5th gen style. However, Pokemon X/Y dealt with Legendary trios better. Some people may have complained about getting only one of the trio per game, but at least it's better that version exclusive trios. I hope that the legendary trios work in the same way as in X/Y. It can still retain the prestige of having all 3 of a trio. The option to trade for them is still available too. And people like me will play the game 3 times, banking Pokemon to get all 3 of a trio. Heck, it adds replayability with Pokemon Bank allowing us to carry our Pokemon over to new saves. So lets hope the trios are done as they are in Pokemon X/Y, heck it may even get them more subscribers for Pokemon Bank. Though we still can't keep items. That's my biggest complaint about Pokemon Bank.As for an ORAS team? I plan to play it through 3 times, with a different starter each time. I'll go serious on the last run, since I'll know the game after the first two times. So far its Sceptile, Groudon and Gallade for run 3 and of course, I'll breed them 5IV with natures and any egg moves, just because I enjoy breeding perfection. I am a perfectionist after all. I'll use Blaziken on run 2, but I feel like I should go the extra mile and breed a 5IV speedboost Torchic too, which won't take too long since I've already got perfect adamant Pokemon of it's egg group in the bank. I wonder if ORAS will still have the IV checker guy and how early would we be able to use him? As for other options, I'm considering Absol, since it's such a badass, but I used one on my first run of Pokemon Y and I want to use different Pokemon. Perhaps that Mega-Glalie would come in useful? I like to keep my options open with Mega's, especially as we can keep opponents guessing whether they'll actually go Mega or not. I'll have a couple of spare mint condition Groudon's up for trade as a result too. Speaking of which, would anyone want a mint Yveltal for a Xerneas? Actually, wrong place for that, sorry.I'm very busy these few weeks, therefore I'm unable to attend the Diancie event. Especially since it's so far away and I don't own a car. As such I've relied on my younger brother to get it on my game for me, hopefully it'll pull through like he did with Shiny-Gengar for the same reasons. I might even use it on one run if it's capable of interesting builds."
2014-11-18T09:34:52-0800,I like to start my new adventures with my favorites at lv 5. Chances are I'm going to put the starter in my pc. I still have the lv 5 torchic they gave away with its mega stone though so I may use that.
2014-11-18T15:04:20-0800,"Ah yes, hence the name. Got it.Mahius, if there are some items you want to keep, instead of sending all your pokemon to Pokemon Bank, you could always trade the pokemon over to a friend or relative's game, then trade back and still have the item available to you. That's what I plan on doing. I will still use Bank of course, but I don't plan on losing my items if I can help it. If I can help you, please let me know."
2014-11-19T00:32:31-0800,"Funny you said that. I actually traded most of my items over to my younger brother's copy Pokemon X after my first 2 play-throughs of Pokemon Y. He's got roughly a box full of my Pokemon & items, though it was previously 2 boxes. I've retrieved one lot so far and banked the Pokemon from it (it takes a while to catch trade-fodder & trade over). I don't think we can trade over Pokemon/items form ORAS to XY now can we? Though my brother did say he was planning on buying AS somehow. Won't really matter till Christmas, I'll take it easy with my first play-through and I can continue on Y if I have to wait for him to get his copy of AS. Or maybe... I have the perfect idea for a Christmas present... hehehe! Oh and as for my final team build, I've just remembered Mega-Salamence! I've got perfected Bagon's in the bank ready to rock, rumble and Mega-Evolve, I'd be a fool not to use one in OR. Especially since I've not used one recently in Pokemon. That's 4 spots in my final party taken up and since Treecko is in the Dragon egg-group, it's easier to breed a perfect one since I've already got Bagons and the like to breed the perfect IV's/natures in. I'm wondering whether they'll have the equivalent of Kalos cafe's to grind levels on in ORAS? Or I may just have to trade my Pokemon over to Y to maintain decent levels. Especially with teams of 6. Gah, I can't hold the excitement, just a week and a day away from having the game! Mega-Swampert here I come!One major question I have about game mechanics, which would likely be able to be answered in a couple of days, Sceptile can't learn Dragon Pulse on level up or TMs. Would there be a move tutor able to teach in in ORAS, cos we could do that in B2W2? I want to utilise that 105 Sp. A, along with Mega-Sceptile STAB if I can."
2014-07-14T04:44:48-0700,"I won't debate that you may indeed be right. Hey, who knows? Your guess at this point may be no more valid or invalid than anyone else. In fact I rather hope you ARE right. However, at this point, until the game arrives, there's a remote possibility you might get surprised. For that reason, I wouldn't start counting your chickens just yet. I could make fantastic claims right now and no one would be the wiser until release day. That's all I have to say on the subject.It's nice to find out a bit more on the ""Super"" secret bases. I like the fact that you can make them into a mini gym where people can battle you. I hope a lot of my friends do that instead of being a collector of dolls and such. However, to each his (or her) own."
2014-07-14T09:57:44-0700,Super secret base sounds fun. One thing I hope returns is letting your lead Pokemon walk around with you. Its not much of a needed change but its the small things that make the game fell more life like. Also would be nice if they did a dungeon crawling mode where you can find items with your Pokemon. Would be cool for a mini game.
2014-07-17T16:03:37-0700,"There's since been information that Metagross is going to get a big buff to its Speed (I'm guessing bumping up to the typical 100) and the rest of its stats are also going to be buffed, as well as getting Touch Claws as a new ability, additionally the same source also said Mega Diancie is going to lose defenses and pick up a lot in the speed and attack stats.In regards to Megas I'm excited for Mega Metagross and Swampert, both are bulky to begin with and have good movepools and typing, but I'm not sold on Mega Sableye or Mega Sceptile yet. Sableye losing prankster is a pretty big deal, and while it promises to become bulkier, I'm not convinced it's going to be enough to make it worthwhile. Sceptile's problem on the other hand has always been its movepool, focusing on physical attacks when its stats emphasize Special. I'm expecting Sceptile to pick up Dragon Pulse, but unless it gets something more that'll leave it at about 4 types for special attacks (including Hidden Power), and its ability while nice doesn't cover any of the major weaknesses its typing gives it."
2014-07-17T17:09:09-0700,"Sceptile already learns Dragon Pulse, right? I could have sworn I came across on that did it. With DP, Giga Drain, Hidden Power Fire and maybe Focus Blast, it would work well with Lightning Rod. Its may get faster. We can only wait to see if it gets anything else.Where is my mega pidgeot though. Thats what I really want."
2014-07-17T19:34:07-0700,"Yes, I did notice there had been some news about Metagross. Good to see it, since I used that, Deoxys, Rayquaza, Swampert, and Kyogre a lot when I was playing the original Sapphire game. Hopefully they'll give Rayquaza a mega as well. In any case, it's good to find out that vaporeon's suspicions were confirmed. I'm really looking forward to ORAS.LOL ..... On a side note, just to show you what's going on at our house, my son Josh (who is 25 this year) had me take him to EB Games to preorder the games. I assumed he was planning on preordering one of them for me. So I asked him which one he wanted for himself. He says to me, ""Both of course! Get your own, Dad!"" Apparently he really loved that pokemon set of games, so wants to play both when they come out this time. That's a first for us, since usually he gets one game and I get the other. So I guess I'll just have to buy both for me! Na na na! Take that annoying youngster!"
2014-07-17T19:45:51-0700,"Dragon Pulse is currently only a move tutor move from gen 5 sad to say, unless they give it Dragon Pulse it'll be stuck with Dragonbreath, but they've been throwing Dragon Pulse around a lot in XY, so it'll probably get it anyway. Even so, those 4 moves aren't enough to sell me on an attacker, especially when Dragon has little coverage and is now blocked by Fairies."
2014-07-17T20:45:31-0700,Yeah but 2 stab is good enough for the mega though since it will be hard to switch into... Even more so if it got the lightning rod boost. It would need a good fairy counter move though. I still have my Black 2 game so I should be able to get Dragon Pulse on mine. I did not know it was a tutor move. I thought it was a egg move. Thanks for letting me know that.

Say you play through the game, get all the badges- defeat the E4- and, you would then be able to download the up-grade to each of the gyms. Different Pokémon and of course higher levels, and each time you go to the E4- there would be a successor to you who has come in after you and is the new champion.In a way it would be even better if there was like say 16 people who are on-line wifi battles for you to earn a badge from the wifi gym. They could have like 10 different teams at their disposal when challenged so that the battles are different every time if you have to rematch if you lost the match. That and not everyone who challenges them will face the same team. Personally, I like the idea but I highly doubt that something of that manner would happen. To me, wifi opens up so many ideas for Pokémon and how the games could be interactive with options other then trading and battles - like there could be a Pokémon universe mode that is a virtual world region set up like XD:GoD where it is a union area for the players to do all sorts of things."
2014-10-02T18:45:33-0700,"Oh now that's what I'm talkin about! Mega Rayquaza! Man I love that pokemon! The design is great and the upgrade makes it even better! Now I definitely can't wait! Have I used enough ! in this post? Na, I don't think so! Here's some more: !!!!!!!!!!"
2014-10-02T20:09:39-0700,I know. That ability would make my bird team OP! Too bad I'll likely have no chance to use it competitively.
2014-10-04T14:21:36-0700,"well- it might be possible that you'll be able to use that ability, Vaporeon. The '14/15 format has yet to be announced.I think the format will be (and I did say ""I think"") ORAS Pokedex combined with X/Y Pokedex, with a restriction to the legendries' list. And the normal no duplicate Pokémon, no duplicate hold item. Like, you'll be able to have ONE legendary in your party, but a ban on Pokémon like Celebi and a ban on the legendary that are not ORAS/X/Y. At least if I could say what the format is, this is what I would do.I think Staraptor would pair awesome with the new 'quazza, perhaps Talonflame would be awesome as well."
2014-10-04T15:11:52-0700,"Well, I would my Pidgeot but I'm also thinking they might allow 1 ""uber"" legendary as well and if they do, I would use mega rayquaza. I just want to know how the move works. I dont know if it removes weakness from flying types of if it makes them immune to rock, lightning and ice attack but only on the flying typing. if thats the case, I can make a team to abuse that ability."
2014-10-04T16:07:54-0700,"Well, to my understanding- the move removes any current weather status, and prevents any further weather changes that come in or are activated. It only keeps Flying type Pokémon from taking ""weakness"" damage, those attacks only do normal damage.The Flying types will definitely get a great boost in use for sure if 'quazza is allowed. So many good Flying Pokémon will get a chance to be on the VGC scene. Charizard will see even more use when paired with 'quazza.What I meant about only 1 legendary being used and Celebi being banned, I was saying that Celebi, Mew, Jirachi- those sort will be banned but you'll be able to use the ""mascot"" legends."
2014-10-04T20:38:19-0700,"Okay, I see. I really dislike selective rules like that. On the ability, for say articuno, would it still take weakness damage because of its ice type, so would stone edge deal 2x damage instead of 4x. Also, I hope they get rid of the native rule."
2014-10-05T18:13:07-0700,I'm also looking forward to see how the mega evolution of Rayquaza looks with my shiny Rayquaza as well.
2014-10-05T22:09:44-0700,Shiny 'quazza.............................................. droooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooolllllll-if it hadn't been ruby/sapphire and emerald- 'quazza should be black
2014-10-06T03:59:13-0700,Probably one of the coolest Megas in the series.
2014-10-06T16:13:17-0700,"I really wish they'd make megas of the pixies as well. They currently are a decent design, but with their stats, competitively they are a dead end in my opinion. I have regular and shiny versions of Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie also, so I'd like to see if anything can be done with them."
2014-10-14T18:12:08-0700,"Well, no pixies yet, but Steelix and Glalie are gonna be megas. Not sure if I like the Steelix one, but that Glalie was just what I would have pictured. Weird but cool."
2014-10-16T17:23:22-0700,"well- with the demos out, there is little room left for speculation, lol."
2014-10-17T04:54:57-0700,"True. Oh well, maybe next time."
2014-10-17T16:14:29-0700,"I'm not so sure, we still could get more Megas. I mean the coding isn't complete as evident by the level up moves for Pokemon like Blaziken apparently being only level 1 moves"
2014-10-17T17:32:08-0700,There are still Pokemon like Zangoose that could have megas. Im sure they make sure to keep data like that out of the demo but we'll see soon enough. I do wish the demo was a worldwide release though.
2014-10-19T07:24:33-0700,"Pretty radical form change to Hoopa though. Wouldn't have even known it was the same pokemon - if pics from the beach are correct. I agree with Fox_Master51 on the other thread - it would be nice to see a Mega Ninetales. However it would also be nice to see a Mega Zoroark, Quagsire, Muk, and Walrein. I've used those a lot over the years (edit: not competitively, but I have used them in the games)."
2014-11-10T04:34:47-0800,"In best Paul Revere voice: The new games are coming, the new games are coming!Yeah, I know it's kinda redundant at this point, but I just had to do it. 11 more days.It'll be kinda interesting to see if that Hunger Games movie will get anywhere near the money that pokemon will on that weekend.Hey, now you Americans will have something more to fight over on Thanksgiving weekend! LOL."
2014-11-10T10:11:50-0800,"Pokemon prints money. I wish I had something like that. On a side note, I was thinking what if Pidgeot had 2 megas. m pidgeot alpha and m pidgeot omega, both of which will specialize in physical and special attack. That would make my day."
2014-11-10T18:45:16-0800,"Well ..... now you're just dreamin' buddy. Life usually doesn't give out beautiful dreams like that. However, given that both Charizard AND Mewtwo both have 2 megas .... hey, you never know."
2014-11-10T22:29:24-0800,"Very true but the reason I say that is because it seems odd to give pidgeot a mega for special when it attack base stat is much higher, though not by much. It would make sense because of things like brave bird and other good egg moves. Either way, I have a pidgey ready for the game to play through with."
2014-11-14T02:55:21-0800,I'm just curious if there are going to be some restrictions with pokemon bank or some such thing to prevent people from trading over pokemon right away. I guess we'll hear about it as time gets closer.
2014-11-14T10:45:09-0800,I hope not. It does suck to play through pokemon game over and over. I have a pidgey I want to send over.
2014-11-15T18:15:51-0800,"There really hasn't been anything inhibiting trades since FRLG as far as I'm aware (maybe HGSS with DPPt), only restrictions regarding cross-gen, and even that isn't a thing in XY"
2014-11-15T20:57:40-0800,"Well- it hasn't been said on when at what point in the game Bank will be accessible. It could be right away or some time in the story mode.As far as trading over, it should be just after your able to obtain pokeballs. The demo gives you some, so it seems to me trading could happen after your first Pokemon center visit. There could be a restriction, like ""the system is in upgrade"" line like previous games, so who knows at this point.There should be no hassles with X/Y and ORAS in Bank use and ""normal"" trading."
2014-11-17T16:50:33-0800,"I am planning as if it is like x and y, so I am already building a team. I will be frustrated if we have to wait but I can quickly level them to what ever is needing in my X and Y."
2014-11-18T00:22:36-0800,I know for sure my team will have vaporeon and pidgeot in it. I may have a zangoose as well.
2014-11-18T03:19:09-0800,"You've piqued my interest - why would you possibly want vaporeon when you could use Swampert? Mega Swampert. Now Pidgeot, that I understand."
2014-11-18T09:06:29-0800,"There was the recent trailer for the 'Delta Episode' so it sounds like Pokemon 'Delta Emerald' is built-in for ORAS. Going into space with Mega-Rayquaza to fight Deoxys sounds very cool, but would you need to catch Rayquaza before this or does this allow the player to catch Rayquaza afterwards? Or is it like cover Pokemon in certain games where the player must catch the Legendary to progress (unless the PC box is full)? I'd hope that catching Rayquaza is a separate thing and we still get to climb the Sky Pillar to get him. As for the other legendary trios being in the game, it sounds pretty cool. However a lot of people are complaining about the game having too may Legendaries. It's quite the opposite of Pokemon X/Y which had fewer Legendaries than previous games. People are mentioning version exclusivity too. I'm putting it down now, I hate the way they made Legendary trios version exclusive and required owning both to get the third in gen 5. I would be a bit upset if they did these trios 5th gen style. However, Pokemon X/Y dealt with Legendary trios better. Some people may have complained about getting only one of the trio per game, but at least it's better that version exclusive trios. I hope that the legendary trios work in the same way as in X/Y. It can still retain the prestige of having all 3 of a trio. The option to trade for them is still available too. And people like me will play the game 3 times, banking Pokemon to get all 3 of a trio. Heck, it adds replayability with Pokemon Bank allowing us to carry our Pokemon over to new saves. So lets hope the trios are done as they are in Pokemon X/Y, heck it may even get them more subscribers for Pokemon Bank. Though we still can't keep items. That's my biggest complaint about Pokemon Bank.As for an ORAS team? I plan to play it through 3 times, with a different starter each time. I'll go serious on the last run, since I'll know the game after the first two times. So far its Sceptile, Groudon and Gallade for run 3 and of course, I'll breed them 5IV with natures and any egg moves, just because I enjoy breeding perfection. I am a perfectionist after all. I'll use Blaziken on run 2, but I feel like I should go the extra mile and breed a 5IV speedboost Torchic too, which won't take too long since I've already got perfect adamant Pokemon of it's egg group in the bank. I wonder if ORAS will still have the IV checker guy and how early would we be able to use him? As for other options, I'm considering Absol, since it's such a badass, but I used one on my first run of Pokemon Y and I want to use different Pokemon. Perhaps that Mega-Glalie would come in useful? I like to keep my options open with Mega's, especially as we can keep opponents guessing whether they'll actually go Mega or not. I'll have a couple of spare mint condition Groudon's up for trade as a result too. Speaking of which, would anyone want a mint Yveltal for a Xerneas? Actually, wrong place for that, sorry.I'm very busy these few weeks, therefore I'm unable to attend the Diancie event. Especially since it's so far away and I don't own a car. As such I've relied on my younger brother to get it on my game for me, hopefully it'll pull through like he did with Shiny-Gengar for the same reasons. I might even use it on one run if it's capable of interesting builds."
2014-11-18T09:34:52-0800,I like to start my new adventures with my favorites at lv 5. Chances are I'm going to put the starter in my pc. I still have the lv 5 torchic they gave away with its mega stone though so I may use that.
2014-11-18T15:04:20-0800,"Ah yes, hence the name. Got it.Mahius, if there are some items you want to keep, instead of sending all your pokemon to Pokemon Bank, you could always trade the pokemon over to a friend or relative's game, then trade back and still have the item available to you. That's what I plan on doing. I will still use Bank of course, but I don't plan on losing my items if I can help it. If I can help you, please let me know."
2014-11-19T00:32:31-0800,"Funny you said that. I actually traded most of my items over to my younger brother's copy Pokemon X after my first 2 play-throughs of Pokemon Y. He's got roughly a box full of my Pokemon & items, though it was previously 2 boxes. I've retrieved one lot so far and banked the Pokemon from it (it takes a while to catch trade-fodder & trade over). I don't think we can trade over Pokemon/items form ORAS to XY now can we? Though my brother did say he was planning on buying AS somehow. Won't really matter till Christmas, I'll take it easy with my first play-through and I can continue on Y if I have to wait for him to get his copy of AS. Or maybe... I have the perfect idea for a Christmas present... hehehe! Oh and as for my final team build, I've just remembered Mega-Salamence! I've got perfected Bagon's in the bank ready to rock, rumble and Mega-Evolve, I'd be a fool not to use one in OR. Especially since I've not used one recently in Pokemon. That's 4 spots in my final party taken up and since Treecko is in the Dragon egg-group, it's easier to breed a perfect one since I've already got Bagons and the like to breed the perfect IV's/natures in. I'm wondering whether they'll have the equivalent of Kalos cafe's to grind levels on in ORAS? Or I may just have to trade my Pokemon over to Y to maintain decent levels. Especially with teams of 6. Gah, I can't hold the excitement, just a week and a day away from having the game! Mega-Swampert here I come!One major question I have about game mechanics, which would likely be able to be answered in a couple of days, Sceptile can't learn Dragon Pulse on level up or TMs. Would there be a move tutor able to teach in in ORAS, cos we could do that in B2W2? I want to utilise that 105 Sp. A, along with Mega-Sceptile STAB if I can."

2014-11-14T02:55:21-0800,I'm just curious if there are going to be some restrictions with pokemon bank or some such thing to prevent people from trading over pokemon right away. I guess we'll hear about it as time gets closer.
2014-11-14T10:45:09-0800,I hope not. It does suck to play through pokemon game over and over. I have a pidgey I want to send over.
2014-11-15T18:15:51-0800,"There really hasn't been anything inhibiting trades since FRLG as far as I'm aware (maybe HGSS with DPPt), only restrictions regarding cross-gen, and even that isn't a thing in XY"
2014-11-15T20:57:40-0800,"Well- it hasn't been said on when at what point in the game Bank will be accessible. It could be right away or some time in the story mode.As far as trading over, it should be just after your able to obtain pokeballs. The demo gives you some, so it seems to me trading could happen after your first Pokemon center visit. There could be a restriction, like ""the system is in upgrade"" line like previous games, so who knows at this point.There should be no hassles with X/Y and ORAS in Bank use and ""normal"" trading."
2014-11-17T16:50:33-0800,"I am planning as if it is like x and y, so I am already building a team. I will be frustrated if we have to wait but I can quickly level them to what ever is needing in my X and Y."

2014-11-18T09:06:29-0800,"There was the recent trailer for the 'Delta Episode' so it sounds like Pokemon 'Delta Emerald' is built-in for ORAS. Going into space with Mega-Rayquaza to fight Deoxys sounds very cool, but would you need to catch Rayquaza before this or does this allow the player to catch Rayquaza afterwards? Or is it like cover Pokemon in certain games where the player must catch the Legendary to progress (unless the PC box is full)? I'd hope that catching Rayquaza is a separate thing and we still get to climb the Sky Pillar to get him. As for the other legendary trios being in the game, it sounds pretty cool. However a lot of people are complaining about the game having too may Legendaries. It's quite the opposite of Pokemon X/Y which had fewer Legendaries than previous games. People are mentioning version exclusivity too. I'm putting it down now, I hate the way they made Legendary trios version exclusive and required owning both to get the third in gen 5. I would be a bit upset if they did these trios 5th gen style. However, Pokemon X/Y dealt with Legendary trios better. Some people may have complained about getting only one of the trio per game, but at least it's better that version exclusive trios. I hope that the legendary trios work in the same way as in X/Y. It can still retain the prestige of having all 3 of a trio. The option to trade for them is still available too. And people like me will play the game 3 times, banking Pokemon to get all 3 of a trio. Heck, it adds replayability with Pokemon Bank allowing us to carry our Pokemon over to new saves. So lets hope the trios are done as they are in Pokemon X/Y, heck it may even get them more subscribers for Pokemon Bank. Though we still can't keep items. That's my biggest complaint about Pokemon Bank.As for an ORAS team? I plan to play it through 3 times, with a different starter each time. I'll go serious on the last run, since I'll know the game after the first two times. So far its Sceptile, Groudon and Gallade for run 3 and of course, I'll breed them 5IV with natures and any egg moves, just because I enjoy breeding perfection. I am a perfectionist after all. I'll use Blaziken on run 2, but I feel like I should go the extra mile and breed a 5IV speedboost Torchic too, which won't take too long since I've already got perfect adamant Pokemon of it's egg group in the bank. I wonder if ORAS will still have the IV checker guy and how early would we be able to use him? As for other options, I'm considering Absol, since it's such a badass, but I used one on my first run of Pokemon Y and I want to use different Pokemon. Perhaps that Mega-Glalie would come in useful? I like to keep my options open with Mega's, especially as we can keep opponents guessing whether they'll actually go Mega or not. I'll have a couple of spare mint condition Groudon's up for trade as a result too. Speaking of which, would anyone want a mint Yveltal for a Xerneas?

2014-10-28T17:49:43-0700,All I know is that all legendaries will have at least 3 31 IVs. I have not gotten my code yet. Now sure I will get it though.
2014-10-29T08:15:36-0700,"Couple thoughts:1. Did you really take like 10 cards? Do you work at GameStop or did they just get so many they were handing out mulitples? I would be so hacked off if I went to gamestop and they didn't have any codes left because someone took a handful of them.2. Can you redeem more than one? I guess I thought you could only get one...3. For some reason, I am unable to download my Diancie. I keep getting errors about needing to upgrade the software or server maintenence. That was last night and this morning. Have you guys heard of anyone else having trouble?"
2014-10-29T11:57:47-0700,"Ken old buddy, good to hear from you. No, I didn't take 10 cards - just one. First you have to download the upgrade to your 3DS and agree to the user agreement before you can download a Diancie. However, once you do, you can reset your game however many times you like while you're in front of the girl in the pokemon center that gives your gift. The code is downloaded on your 3DS - not your game. The only time it becomes permanent is after you decide which Diancie you want and save your game (once you finally pick it up). That's what I've been doing - just resetting and resetting until I get the one I really want. In fact, I haven't tried to download the demo for ORAS yet, just in case I screw up my chances to get the right Diancie.Edit: No you can't download more than one Diancie - it's one per 3DS. However I suppose if you have more than one 3DS it might be possible."
2014-11-02T22:31:28-0800,You sure on the one per 3DS? If it's like the shiny Gengar and Pinsirite/Heracrossite it's one per game
2014-11-03T04:48:15-0800,"Ahhh, ok, I guess my sig comes in handy for this situation. I have been known to be wrong from time to time. I didn't try it with a different version in my 3DS, but I did try a second code. Josh and I both had pre orders for both OR and AS - so all told we ended up getting 4 download codes. It took me until my 20th (or so - it may have been my 19th) Diancie to get the one I wanted. Once I got the one I wanted, I tried for a second code on the same game/same 3DS, and it didn't work, so Josh gave the code to one of his friends."
2014-11-03T20:41:00-0800,"Did every time you check the IV's there was 3? I sr'd so many times and gave up ending in only 1 31 IV. I don't think DL'd Pokies are garunteed to have 3 31's, I seriously sr'd minimum 100 times, checked the pokie with the IV checker guy and had mabye a handfull come up with 1 31 IV-"
2014-11-04T03:09:09-0800,"Yep, weird as it sounds, there wasn't once that I didn't get a poke with less than 3 perfect IV's. About one third of the time I got one with 4 perfect IV's. So hopefully your experience was a fluke."
2014-11-04T12:01:31-0800,So interesting!!!
2014-11-04T16:18:41-0800,"interesting..................fluke or not- it seems way off in my attempts at getting only one if the dl is programed to give 3 31's.meh, more then likely Diance won't be able to be VGC usable- so I don't mind the novelty of it anyways............."
2014-11-06T21:18:42-0800,"That was the reason why it took me so long to get the Shiny Gengar that I wanted, since I was serial resetting my machine to get the best one for me.Yeah, Benzo, I see your point about it not being playable, but I suppose I still wanted the ""best"" one I could get. Hopefully my experience above might help someone see what was available - regardless of how it turned out for them."
2014-11-07T18:09:23-0800,"No prob, PA. I trade some code cards awhile back to get a Japanese Diance- it had only 1 31 as well. I wanted a ""relatively"" good English one to make up for the not-so-good traded one (stat wise)- but since disappointment got the best of me in my attempts and it more then likely won't be VGC usable- I settled on novalty to get back to the real training for my teams.I enjoyed your muse, and I meant no ""downer"" to the topic.Jealous, maybe, a little, lol.But it's just reading that reading that 3 31's are there and mine was a train-wreck attempt, I'm glad others are not as unlucky as me. It shows me that once again that ""not all Pokemon are the same"", an aspect in the design of the game that's been there from the start-gratz on getting the one ya wanted!"
2014-11-15T15:26:14-0800,"Not sure if this will save you some time.My X is Hasty nature, Takes plenty of siestas, Clear Body, 31/26/11/30/30/8 per Serebii XY IV calculator, with the 30 reaching 31 as they level.HP 125Att 118Def 144SpA 120SpD 170Sp 64My Y is Quiet, Takes plenty of siestas, Clear Body, 31/20/30/12/12/30HP 125Att 115Def 170SpA 122SpD 161Sp 63Not sure it helps, but hope it does."
2014-11-15T16:55:11-0800,"Siloam, it's good to see some more poke-parents here. Welcome and all. However, I have a question: ummm, how do you know that the 30's become 31's? Can't you just go to the IV checker in Kiloude city? He'll tell you which ones have the highest stats, and if you have some 31's he'll say that those stats ""can't be beat."" Thanks for your information to add to what is above. With seeing that you have a Quiet pokemon (the same as I did above), it really shows that every pokemon has differences even with the same nature. Good to know.Benzo, if what I think is the case, due to Siloam's post, it looks like you aren't the only one who didn't get 3 31 IV's. Of course, like you said, since they probably will never be able to be used in the video game challenge, then I suppose there's no big deal. If you go to Seribii like Siloam did, you can probably find that some of your stats might be 30's as well. If that's the case, I certainly wouldn't be jealous in any way if I found out mine were only one stat out.I'm just hoping this week passes by really quickly, so I can get both my ORAS games and transfer some of these cool pokemon over."
2014-11-15T18:13:21-0800,"My understanding is that the IV calculators don't have enough information to give exact numbers so they estimate some pieces...or something like that. I've gotten the impression that they are only truly accurate at level 100.According to one of the guides I have Quiet raises Special Attack and decreases speed; While Takes Plenty of Siestas is suppose to result in a stat that is 1, 6 11, 21, 26 or 31. I'm still working on wrapping my mind around all of it, but maybe that means that my first one will end up 31/26/11/31/31/11? And the second 31/21/31/16/16/31? IDK....it is a whole lot of numbers flying around and I'm just trusting who made the guide knows what they are talking about.Anyway went and talked to the judge and he said can't be bear for HP SP Att and Sp Def.; The second was HP, Defense and Speed."
2014-11-18T16:38:56-0800,"While we're on this, does anyone have anymore of the codes? Gamestops around me dont have anymore."
2014-11-18T17:08:17-0800,@ Siloem: which guide?
2014-11-18T17:14:56-0800,"Call Nintendo of America. They can give you codes via e-mail. I don't think they like to. With the previous event we went in 2 days after it started and there were no cards, so after some pushing they sent me 5 codes via e-mail (myself and my 4 kids).- - - Updated - - -A combination my oldest put together from Marriland and Serebii. I looked at it again through the other night and I think it only applies to one stat and not all of them. *shurg* I am such a noob at this."
2014-11-18T17:27:50-0800,"Ummm, I can't be sure of course, but on the codes we got they mention that the event is from 10/27 through 11/16. I have one that hasn't been used yet - but I don't know if it's possible to use it."
2014-11-18T18:20:33-0800,"Oh, if you dont mine, could you pm me the code?"
2014-10-27T20:08:56-0700,"Ok, I got a Diancie code. I figure I might be able to help out by reporting what I find. I'm actually looking for a Sassy or Relaxed type, so I'll be resetting my game until I get a decent one. The Diancie turned out to be level 50.First pokemon I got was a Brave nature pokemon, with Clear Body ability and ""superior"" IV's 31/x/31/31/x/x. Here are it's stats:HP 125Att 121Def 170SpA 120SpD 163Sp 62.Next one was Adamant natured, Clear Body, and ""Superior"" IV's 31/x/31/31/31/xHP 125Att 122Def 170SpA 108SpD 170Sp 59.Next up - Careful, Clear Body, ""Superior"" IV's 31/x/31/x/x/31HP 125Att 114Def 170SpA 100SpD 181Sp 70.More info as I find it.Next up - Rash, Clear Body, ""Outstanding"" IV's 31/x/31/x/31/xHP 125Att 109Def 170SpA 132SpD 153Sp 65.Next up - Quiet - clear body, ""Superior"" IV's x/31/x/31/31/xHP 118Att 120Def 167SpA 132SpD 170Sp 53.Next up - Naughty, clear body, ""Outstanding"" IV's x/31/31/x/31/31HP 121Att 132Def 170SpA 110SpD 153Sp 70.Almost tempting to keep - but no cigar.More info to come later.Edit: Next up - Brave, clear body, ""Superior"" IV's x/x/x/31/31/31HP 112Att 121Def 170SpA 120SpD 170Sp 63.Next: Lax, clear body, ""Superior"" 31/0/31/x/31/xHP 125Att 105Def 187SpA 117SpD 153Sp 66.

2014-10-28T17:00:07-0700,"Is anyone really all that interested in this stuff besides me? Just thought I would ask, otherwise I'll just go on without reporting my results. Please let me know."
2014-10-28T17:49:43-0700,All I know is that all legendaries will have at least 3 31 IVs. I have not gotten my code yet. Now sure I will get it though.
2014-10-29T08:15:36-0700,"Couple thoughts:1. Did you really take like 10 cards? Do you work at GameStop or did they just get so many they were handing out mulitples? I would be so hacked off if I went to gamestop and they didn't have any codes left because someone took a handful of them.2. Can you redeem more than one? I guess I thought you could only get one...3. For some reason, I am unable to download my Diancie. I keep getting errors about needing to upgrade the software or server maintenence. That was last night and this morning. Have you guys heard of anyone else having trouble?"
2014-10-29T11:57:47-0700,"Ken old buddy, good to hear from you. No, I didn't take 10 cards - just one. First you have to download the upgrade to your 3DS and agree to the user agreement before you can download a Diancie. However, once you do, you can reset your game however many times you like while you're in front of the girl in the pokemon center that gives your gift. The code is downloaded on your 3DS - not your game. The only time it becomes permanent is after you decide which Diancie you want and save your game (once you finally pick it up). That's what I've been doing - just resetting and resetting until I get the one I really want. In fact, I haven't tried to download the demo for ORAS yet, just in case I screw up my chances to get the right Diancie.Edit: No you can't download more than one Diancie - it's one per 3DS. However I suppose if you have more than one 3DS it might be possible."
2014-11-02T22:31:28-0800,You sure on the one per 3DS? If it's like the shiny Gengar and Pinsirite/Heracrossite it's one per game
2014-11-03T04:48:15-0800,"Ahhh, ok, I guess my sig comes in handy for this situation. I have been known to be wrong from time to time. I didn't try it with a different version in my 3DS, but I did try a second code. Josh and I both had pre orders for both OR and AS - so all told we ended up getting 4 download codes. It took me until my 20th (or so - it may have been my 19th) Diancie to get the one I wanted. Once I got the one I wanted, I tried for a second code on the same game/same 3DS, and it didn't work, so Josh gave the code to one of his friends."
2014-11-03T20:41:00-0800,"Did every time you check the IV's there was 3? I sr'd so many times and gave up ending in only 1 31 IV. I don't think DL'd Pokies are garunteed to have 3 31's, I seriously sr'd minimum 100 times, checked the pokie with the IV checker guy and had mabye a handfull come up with 1 31 IV-"
2014-11-04T03:09:09-0800,"Yep, weird as it sounds, there wasn't once that I didn't get a poke with less than 3 perfect IV's. About one third of the time I got one with 4 perfect IV's. So hopefully your experience was a fluke."
2014-11-04T12:01:31-0800,So interesting!!!
2014-11-04T16:18:41-0800,"interesting..................fluke or not- it seems way off in my attempts at getting only one if the dl is programed to give 3 31's.meh, more then likely Diance won't be able to be VGC usable- so I don't mind the novelty of it anyways............."
2014-11-06T21:18:42-0800,"That was the reason why it took me so long to get the Shiny Gengar that I wanted, since I was serial resetting my machine to get the best one for me.Yeah, Benzo, I see your point about it not being playable, but I suppose I still wanted the ""best"" one I could get. Hopefully my experience above might help someone see what was available - regardless of how it turned out for them."
2014-11-07T18:09:23-0800,"No prob, PA. I trade some code cards awhile back to get a Japanese Diance- it had only 1 31 as well. I wanted a ""relatively"" good English one to make up for the not-so-good traded one (stat wise)- but since disappointment got the best of me in my attempts and it more then likely won't be VGC usable- I settled on novalty to get back to the real training for my teams.I enjoyed your muse, and I meant no ""downer"" to the topic.Jealous, maybe, a little, lol.But it's just reading that reading that 3 31's are there and mine was a train-wreck attempt, I'm glad others are not as unlucky as me. It shows me that once again that ""not all Pokemon are the same"", an aspect in the design of the game that's been there from the start-gratz on getting the one ya wanted!"
2014-11-15T15:26:14-0800,"Not sure if this will save you some time.My X is Hasty nature, Takes plenty of siestas, Clear Body, 31/26/11/30/30/8 per Serebii XY IV calculator, with the 30 reaching 31 as they level.HP 125Att 118Def 144SpA 120SpD 170Sp 64My Y is Quiet, Takes plenty of siestas, Clear Body, 31/20/30/12/12/30HP 125Att 115Def 170SpA 122SpD 161Sp 63Not sure it helps, but hope it does."
2014-11-15T16:55:11-0800,"Siloam, it's good to see some more poke-parents here. Welcome and all. However, I have a question: ummm, how do you know that the 30's become 31's? Can't you just go to the IV checker in Kiloude city? He'll tell you which ones have the highest stats, and if you have some 31's he'll say that those stats ""can't be beat."" Thanks for your information to add to what is above. With seeing that you have a Quiet pokemon (the same as I did above), it really shows that every pokemon has differences even with the same nature. Good to know.Benzo, if what I think is the case, due to Siloam's post, it looks like you aren't the only one who didn't get 3 31 IV's. Of course, like you said, since they probably will never be able to be used in the video game challenge, then I suppose there's no big deal. If you go to Seribii like Siloam did, you can probably find that some of your stats might be 30's as well.

Some would say that it would be better to just have one game that has all the regions in it with all the Pokémon- (which would be awesome and all but a huge loss if you lost your cartridge or it got damaged)- but the ability to do that would be interesting in how the games synch up and allows you to basically keep the ""story"" mode going.The return of the Capsule balls.

2014-09-19T05:01:52-0700,"MOAR, MOAR, MOAR! Yeah, I thought about that a lot, and I suppose it's worth repeating, but here is a comment I made earlier:Yeah, I'd like to see the return of secret bases, mind you, I'd like to see more content there. It would be nice to be able to call up people from your secret base and have a battle, call up your ""friends"" from your friend code and do a mini safari game, or a catch-em-all competition, or maybe use that base as an avenue to call up pokemon from an earlier game. It would also be cool to make more use of farming berries - maybe even underwater berries where you have to fend off certain pokemon that love to eat them, and the use of underwater caves. Perhaps even more content after you learn how to climb rocks, and dive? I doubt this would happen, but it would be nice to see the use of cross-breeding, and more of the mechanic that made Black and White Kyurem. I'm sure on the average, most current pokemon game owners will jump at the chance for another adventure, but this could be a game with so much more than the standard - using online capabilities as well - possibly making it into the facebook of the pokemon world. How about maybe giving previews of who your next gym battle will be with, and what kind of battles you'll face there, so you can catch specific pokemon to help you out if you so desire. How about level of difficulty instead of just playing the game as is? How about letting a pokemon follow you through the game (or not) if you desire, a la pokemon yellow? And if you do end up letting a pokemon out of it's pokeball, when another pokemon touches it (instead of you), you can battle, or talk as well. Better communication between you and your pokemon .... how about fatigue like another person suggested in another thread? How about finding bully pokemon that you have to try to tame? Bully trainers that you have to try to liberate their pokemon from? How about the return of dark pokemon?, and maybe even the birth of a new type of pokemon - light pokemon? Pokemon X and Y brought the fractured pokedex - how about doing a rock/paper/scizor thing with this pokedex so that regardless of what type the pokemon is, they have a minor advantage over another specific region (as an explanation maybe there's just something in the water in a particular region, and something else which gives a disadvantage to another region). How about bringing back more time of year and weather effects? How about bringing in a map where you aren't constrained to going down a specific path but can wander aimlessly from any point of the compass - but only with the right conditions. There would be certain obstacles that you would need to learn to overcome - like brambles that poison YOU and your pokemon if you try to go through them where you need a specific pokemon in your party to either eat the obstacle or heal you and your pokemon, fences that you need a Gogoat for, and the usual high wall or water crossing that you need the requisite moveset to overcome. That way you could learn where you need to go by your experiences - if you wander into an area that has significantly higher level pokemon and your pokemon all faint you go back to your last pokemon center and choose a different path. Eventually you still will need the 8 badges to challenge the pokemon league. How about more tm's and the ability to use 5 moves instead of 4? Button combo moves? How about instead of turn based moves, you have the option to use the speed of the reaction of the player to base the attack on - such as if the player is quick to input what would normally be a slow move, it still attacks before something like Extreme speed, or Quick attack, due to the fast input of the attack. How about continued use of the Horde mechanic - possibly expanded to being able to catch more than one pokemon at a time if you have enough of the right pokeballs to do so - or maybe even one or two of the horde pokemon with slightly higher stats or levels, or the ability to flee. How about fitness based experiences as well - for example, if you treat a pokemon well, and make sure it's used a lot, it makes a better companion and more useable pokemon in battle, but if you don't feed it regularly it becomes underweight and it's stats suffer, or overfeed it and less exercise and it becomes too slow and the stats suffer. We've already seen some customization for trainers with outfits and accessories and such, but how about customizable music selection, and the ability to listen to your own music in your travels? And how about more rewards - possibly even more usable in-game items, collectable badges or certificates for achievements? How about wider results and outcomes based upon your responses to the game? Addition of more puzzles.Along with that comment, I'd like to see a bit more weird content - In some of our latest games we've had to ride mamoswine to cross an area of snowbelt, how about like a sky city where you need to watch where you step, or ride a flying or bug pokemon to access certain spots, an underwater city possibly where you need to ride a water pokemon (edit: one that can learn Dive) to survive the depths, also a mountain type city where you have to ride an earth or possibly a fighting type pokemon to access certain heights, and a mirage type city where you need to ride a ghost or fairy type to even see certain rooms. EDIT: How about an industrialized area where the air is so toxic you need to ride a poison pokemon to survive? Or how about some races where you ride all different types of non-flying pokemon to see which species is the fastest? Or how about racing the same specific pokemon and the winner has the best speed stat, or is determined by the ability of the player's racing skills? How about more Sky Battles? I really liked the battles where the effects were opposite - can't remember the town or the trainer I faced, but where water was not effective against fire, but grass attacks were super effective. I'd like to see more battles like that - but random so you never know where that type of battle may occur. You'd need to see from how the effect of the battles was going and adjust your strategy accordingly. Or how about if the effects switch after lets say 5 turns, so you have to continuously switch your strategy. Yeah, I can come up with a lot of new scenarios."
2014-10-12T07:44:46-0700,"Well, at least one of the things I mentioned will be present on ORAS. You get to ride Latias/Latios around the clouds and encounter legendary pokemon. Mind you, I suspect that will be a feature after you beat the pokemon league - just my opinion. I guess we'll have to wait and see if any other cool new stuff is available in ORAS."
2014-10-12T11:05:55-0700,"Not really a feature but I would like to see a new story, with old teams. I would like to see a partnership with Team Rocket and Team Galaxy. I would also like to see open flying, where you can get to new locations you cant get to otherwise."

Pokemon X and Y brought the fractured pokedex - how about doing a rock/paper/scizor thing with this pokedex so that regardless of what type the pokemon is, they have a minor advantage over another specific region (as an explanation maybe there's just something in the water in a particular region, and something else which gives a disadvantage to another region). How about bringing back more time of year and weather effects? How about bringing in a map where you aren't constrained to going down a specific path but can wander aimlessly from any point of the compass - but only with the right conditions. There would be certain obstacles that you would need to learn to overcome - like brambles that poison YOU and your pokemon if you try to go through them where you need a specific pokemon in your party to either eat the obstacle or heal you and your pokemon, fences that you need a Gogoat for, and the usual high wall or water crossing that you need the requisite moveset to overcome. That way you could learn where you need to go by your experiences - if you wander into an area that has significantly higher level pokemon and your pokemon all faint you go back to your last pokemon center and choose a different path. Eventually you still will need the 8 badges to challenge the pokemon league. How about more tm's and the ability to use 5 moves instead of 4? Button combo moves? How about instead of turn based moves, you have the option to use the speed of the reaction of the player to base the attack on - such as if the player is quick to input what would normally be a slow move, it still attacks before something like Extreme speed, or Quick attack, due to the fast input of the attack. How about continued use of the Horde mechanic - possibly expanded to being able to catch more than one pokemon at a time if you have enough of the right pokeballs to do so - or maybe even one or two of the horde pokemon with slightly higher stats or levels, or the ability to flee. How about fitness based experiences as well - for example, if you treat a pokemon well, and make sure it's used a lot, it makes a better companion and more useable pokemon in battle, but if you don't feed it regularly it becomes underweight and it's stats suffer, or overfeed it and less exercise and it becomes too slow and the stats suffer. We've already seen some customization for trainers with outfits and accessories and such, but how about customizable music selection, and the ability to listen to your own music in your travels? And how about more rewards - possibly even more usable in-game items, collectable badges or certificates for achievements? How about wider results and outcomes based upon your responses to the game? Addition of more puzzles.Along with that comment, I'd like to see a bit more weird content - In some of our latest games we've had to ride mamoswine to cross an area of snowbelt, how about like a sky city where you need to watch where you step, or ride a flying or bug pokemon to access certain spots, an underwater city possibly where you need to ride a water pokemon (edit: one that can learn Dive) to survive the depths, also a mountain type city where you have to ride an earth or possibly a fighting type pokemon to access certain heights, and a mirage type city where you need to ride a ghost or fairy type to even see certain rooms. EDIT: How about an industrialized area where the air is so toxic you need to ride a poison pokemon to survive? Or how about some races where you ride all different types of non-flying pokemon to see which species is the fastest? Or how about racing the same specific pokemon and the winner has the best speed stat, or is determined by the ability of the player's racing skills? How about more Sky Battles? I really liked the battles where the effects were opposite - can't remember the town or the trainer I faced, but where water was not effective against fire, but grass attacks were super effective. I'd like to see more battles like that - but random so you never know where that type of battle may occur. You'd need to see from how the effect of the battles was going and adjust your strategy accordingly. Or how about if the effects switch after lets say 5 turns, so you have to continuously switch your strategy. Yeah, I can come up with a lot of new scenarios."
2014-10-12T07:44:46-0700,"Well, at least one of the things I mentioned will be present on ORAS. You get to ride Latias/Latios around the clouds and encounter legendary pokemon. Mind you, I suspect that will be a feature after you beat the pokemon league - just my opinion. I guess we'll have to wait and see if any other cool new stuff is available in ORAS."
2014-10-12T11:05:55-0700,"Not really a feature but I would like to see a new story, with old teams. I would like to see a partnership with Team Rocket and Team Galaxy. I would also like to see open flying, where you can get to new locations you cant get to otherwise."
2014-10-12T14:15:49-0700,"Yeah, that would be nice if we could fly/transport to another region (with updated graphics of course)."
2014-09-18T16:17:09-0700,"What are some things you would like to see in future Pokémon games?Some of the things I would like to be added are:An item to change a Pokémon to be shiny. You breed away trying to get the right nature and IV's, but the chance to get it to be shiny AND just perfect is time consuming and based on too many factors to get a shiny. There is the bp costly ability capsule (which doesn't even do hidden abilities btw), so I can see the possible option to get a capsule that changes the sprites on any Pokémon you choose.The ability to go to a ""gate"" in the game that allows you to take out your current game and pop in another game to continue on, sort of a link-up between games that integrates the two together. Some would say that it would be better to just have one game that has all the regions in it with all the Pokémon- (which would be awesome and all but a huge loss if you lost your cartridge or it got damaged)- but the ability to do that would be interesting in how the games synch up and allows you to basically keep the ""story"" mode going.The return of the Capsule balls. Decorate away! having a shiny Pokémon pop-out with the Capsule feature is rather shweet IMO. Plus, I liked being able to put ""Bring it!"" words as a battle cry sort of thing when the Pokies came onto the battle field.A wifi City where you can go global and open a trade market so you can put some trade offers. I know, I know- we have the GTS, friend safari, FC's, and the what-not to trade- but this way you could have say 3 pokies in your shop and it makes your trade options more controlled vs waiting on ONE possible trade via the GTS and not really being able to offer something else in return for trading.All I have at the moment, some other ideas as well but I'll toss that in later to further contribute discussion-What are some things you would like to see?"
2014-09-19T05:01:52-0700,"MOAR, MOAR, MOAR! Yeah, I thought about that a lot, and I suppose it's worth repeating, but here is a comment I made earlier:Yeah, I'd like to see the return of secret bases, mind you, I'd like to see more content there. It would be nice to be able to call up people from your secret base and have a battle, call up your ""friends"" from your friend code and do a mini safari game, or a catch-em-all competition, or maybe use that base as an avenue to call up pokemon from an earlier game. It would also be cool to make more use of farming berries - maybe even underwater berries where you have to fend off certain pokemon that love to eat them, and the use of underwater caves. Perhaps even more content after you learn how to climb rocks, and dive? I doubt this would happen, but it would be nice to see the use of cross-breeding, and more of the mechanic that made Black and White Kyurem. I'm sure on the average, most current pokemon game owners will jump at the chance for another adventure, but this could be a game with so much more than the standard - using online capabilities as well - possibly making it into the facebook of the pokemon world. How about maybe giving previews of who your next gym battle will be with, and what kind of battles you'll face there, so you can catch specific pokemon to help you out if you so desire. How about level of difficulty instead of just playing the game as is? How about letting a pokemon follow you through the game (or not) if you desire, a la pokemon yellow? And if you do end up letting a pokemon out of it's pokeball, when another pokemon touches it (instead of you), you can battle, or talk as well. Better communication between you and your pokemon .... how about fatigue like another person suggested in another thread? How about finding bully pokemon that you have to try to tame? Bully trainers that you have to try to liberate their pokemon from? How about the return of dark pokemon?, and maybe even the birth of a new type of pokemon - light pokemon?

2014-09-21T12:50:56-0700,"Well, just because I'm the head of the household I have to preorder four copies of the games, one for each family member...I had originally preordered them at Gamestop but I am considering going there and canceling those preorders and getting them at TRUs instead...unless Gamestop pulls something amazing out of their hat in the next month."
2014-08-29T04:59:35-0700,"It's too bad that not everyone can get the same preorder bonuses for ORAS. Some stores are offering a double sided poster, some are giving plushes. Then I also heard that somewhere in Europe they get a steelbook and a keychain. Hey, don't get me wrong - I'm happy that people are getting bonuses for getting the games, since it brings more people to more product. It's just kinda too bad that everyone couldn't take advantage of getting these bonuses at the same time. Maybe it has something with shipping problems from one country to another or increased costs to ship internationally and getting it all there on time, but I suppose if people got things done early enough anything is possible.Then again, nothing has ever been entirely fair and equitable in pokemon. Take for example distribution of event pokemon. Japan has many more opportunities to get event pokemon than here (like that cool shiny Gengar with the mega stone and the move that can't normally be learned by it - who knows, I suppose there's a possibility we may be able to get it much later), and the Japanese card game players have had huge promo distributions of cards where we only get a select few. So I guess this shouldn't surprise me. It's unfortunate though."
2014-08-29T17:16:24-0700,I'm a little upset I was not able to get Blue's Pidgeot they gave out last year because its exclusive to japan. I also did not know they were giving away good swag for preorders. Its normally just junk and I don't pay attention to it. I'll see what they are offering in my area.
2014-08-30T20:43:06-0700,"I guess marketing is key to drawing in areas around the world as the game grows larger beyond Japan, USA, Europe.I can see that the USA is ""further"" along in the franchise then elsewhere in the world when it comes to the video games and cards, so I can see the rest of the worlds view on how ""lucky"" we are getting what they do not recieve.IMO- Japan is more ""festive"" then here in the US, so they are more opt to reward more for commemorative/celebrative reasons. It's more cultural, I guess? <if that makes sence-I think instead of being sour about what we don't get could be better turned into an effort towards looking into ways to have US distributions be more frequent and semi exclusive to the player base here.Even though I too am a slight bit sour to not being able to recieve all the event pokies Japan gets- I am at least greatful that we get world wide game version release date synchronization.- - - Updated - - -I guess marketing is key to drawing in areas around the world as the game grows larger beyond Japan, USA, Europe.I can see that the USA is ""further"" along in the franchise then elsewhere in the world when it comes to the video games and cards, so I can see the rest of the worlds view on how ""lucky"" we are getting what they do not recieve.IMO- Japan is more ""festive"" then here in the US, so they are more opt to reward more for commemorative/celebrative reasons.

2014-08-31T07:36:06-0700,"That's true, Benzo. Things could definitely be worse. There is that."
2014-08-31T17:53:44-0700,"The preorder bonuses in the US suck.There's no real incentive to preorder, but I will since I wanna secure a game on release.I would love the steelbook.Also isn't the plushie only a preorder bonus if you buy both?"
2014-08-31T21:42:05-0700,Gasp! What kind of a pokemon fan are you? Weren't you planning on getting both? LOL.
2014-09-01T15:26:39-0700,huh- I need to double check that Toys R Us plushie deal then-
2014-09-01T21:00:19-0700,"I wouldn't mind a plushie, but I rarely buy both games at the same time, if ever in a given format, as in the past there was always a 3rd cart (Crystal, Emerald, etc) that I'd wait for instead. Granted that hasn't been the case for a bit now, but I just wait in case."
2014-09-04T16:57:03-0700,"I suppose everyone here knows what Japanese players get with their preorder now as well. The quick balls are a bit of ... meh, ok, but they might come in handy. However it would be nice if there was something like that done worldwide - for ANY preorders - not just one particular country."
2014-09-12T02:05:56-0700,I'm really interested to see what the Charizard plush is for ordering both at Toys R Us.

2014-06-02T18:59:00-0700,With the release of Pokémon Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire set to be released in the near future- and the X/Y Dex only Format being what is allowed for Competitive Play-Which Pokémon would you like to see on the battle field that has been currently restricted?Metagross?Brongzong?Swampert?Dusknor?What do you think will bring in a new breath of change to the current meta?Which Pokémon do you think should be allowed in the next format?Feel free to toss in your thoughts or wants!
2014-06-03T11:19:53-0700,Game Freak and Nintendo should stop with the restrictions on whats allowed. Its pointless to prevent non native XY Pokemon from being used. They should focus on more balanced play.
2014-06-08T17:27:09-0700,"I am rather sure that X/Y breed Pokémon that get transferred over to ORAS will be able to be used in the new format. Those Pokémon do fall under the ""breed in"" category with a mark, and more then likely ORAS will require the game symbol (if the games continue the symbol and they do opt to keep X/Y blue symbol)-I do not see much of an issue to not want to start breeding for the transfer over.I think the entire reason to have those symbols was a way to track a better history of a Pokemon's ""history"" and to be ""filtered out"" of the older system to in hopes of having a non-hacked atmosphere all- around.Even though it is electronics, and hacks are still around- the best thing to happen is the attempts to weed out the hacked and try to implement a better system to conquer a never ending cycle (but to greatly slow down the process of allowing hacks to get into the competition which is the #1 main concern of the players base IS handling hacked Pokies in battles)- so, over all- I think we can see a rather smoother transition to making the jump to ORAS with less hassle.For example- there should be a compatible way to link the Bank between X/Y to ORAS, and, Bank is a filter as it is- and to me it looks as if people are welcoming the attempts to make the competitive scene ""hack free""- there shouldn't be a step back but steps forward to move on to include the combination of X/Y and ORAS to better the games for everyone.My guess as well that there will be some point in the new games that Bank will not be accessible right away (if so, full dex right off,), but, to be X/Y mixed per say to have access to all the POkies is looking like the format will be expanded into a lager base to break up the meta in allowing more available Pokémon to battle.If they do decide to restrict the format to ORAS for the format and restrict the Pokémon to that dex only- I think there will be a great amount of severe disappointment and a huge step back and IMO it will hurt the game. As I see it, instead of restricting the stratagies to only a select few battle worthy Pokémon to a format is most hurtful and creates a format that is left to a ""stale year"" of seeing the same teams face off due to the lack of strategy out there when there are so many battle worthy Pokémon and so many teams to create- it would be great to see different teams throughout the year then just what is ""meta"" the whole year and being predictable and repetitive.my thoughts, 2 coppers is all--"
2014-06-10T17:11:34-0700,"I still think Speed Boost will rule the meta. On XY right now, I keep losing to teams that abuse it and other Speed/Whatever modifiers. I would like to see speed balanced out. I know that wont happen till the next gen but as of now, speed and power rule the game."
2014-06-10T23:03:27-0700,"The current format is rather heavy on speed and power being the main ""strategy"", because it is what is working for getting wins.That is what has been shown right now that the balance is off, with little options to counter the trend of teams being built to exploit that unbalance.If perhaps a suprise ""7th Gen"" happens, meaning there are added Pokemon to boost the type (single or dual type [maybe a 3 type like poison+dark+grass]) count total (more Fairy, poison, dark..... the types with the lowest count by battle worthy Pokemon)(liike, so many water type Pokemon yet only so many make good for VGC play time)- then there will be even more balance brought in.Just bringing back in all the Pokies that have not been able to be used since it is X/Y dex only, we will have a good amount of balance brought in that it will change up the current meta alot and we will see more team building options for sure if the format expands to include both X/Y and ORAS."
2014-06-10T23:32:11-0700,"The abilities are out of control. Just all of Pokemon really. Abilities are better when they were defensively passive or used to enhance a Pokemon's natural ability, Like Keen Eyes seeing through evasion mod. Now abilities boost raw stats a great deal and are no longer exclusive as these abilities are going on Pokemon with huge stats. Speed Boost a Ninjask was not that big a deal because it was not really a offensive threat and take a spot on the team. Speed Boost on a Blaziken, who also has a mega is a big deal.Also, Where is my lightning rod Zapdos?"
2014-06-11T03:01:09-0700,"Oh- lightning Zapdos is in the Lost Zone hanging with his bro Giratina..........Abilities are meant to provide a Pokemon with a way to enhance the various aspects of the battle. While a good number of abilities do not serve much of a selection in the competitive scene- I do agree that some are over used and slightly misplaced on the wrong Pokemon.The main core to wrecking that IMO is to build your team with a strategy that is not ""meta"" reliant to counter it. There are ways to get around abilities for sure- but looking beyond what ""should"" be there is harder then looking for ""what's missing"".When the meta is stale and repetitive, people have already looked at what is working and what is well built to handle at least 85% of what is out there based on the current trend.Going rogue and finding the ""missing"" means that regardless of an ability that is over powering to looking at what your team is missing in order to use that ability being used against you and turning it against that Pokemon. There are solutions that are there, and building Pokemon to the meta expectations is what most of the time is the wrong approach.Like Garchomp having hidden power ice. The new ""norm"" to counter other Garchomps. Why not look into the ""missing"" and find a strategy that makes your opponent surprised that you didn't build only to counter, but to put their strategy in risk even if it is at the cost of your own Garchomp?It is harder to recover a strategy then it is to make up a loss of a Pokemon over the continued attempts to worry about the abilities the opposing Pokemon have and how over powering you believe them to be. I never build around abilities as it is."
2014-06-11T09:14:02-0700,"Well, I play with Pokemon I like and their abilities aren't aggressive. Gale Wing Talonflame is questionable but its made up for its lack of power. Sure Pidgeot has a 101 speed based stat but its attack was not raised so I would have to give it a choice band, same with Talonflame to get any good damage while a Pokemon with Speed Boost has the raw attack and speed to begin with while also being at least 100 base stat higher than most. Im not saying my favorites need to be the best but lots of Pokemon are getting overlooked because of those with aggressive abilities.its also Pokemon with aggressive attacks. Like some dragons/dragon egg group pokes have the ability Moxie. While not a issue all in its own, they also have Dragon Dance. So in most of the competitive games I lost, I lose to either Speed boost or Dragon dance. Those are the most annoying losses to have because no matter how well you play, you still lose to nonsense.I started going around with Murkrow but thats like me using a 5 poke team and dont even get me started on Shell Smash."
2014-07-07T09:13:50-0700,"There are a lot of Pokémon that I like, but which are terrible in competition, and so I don't use them on a competitive team. That's because competition is aboutwinning. Wishing that competitive battling were 'more fair' to underused Pokémon and the trainers who love them is just silly. Imagine a World Cup soccer player who feels that shots with the dominant foot are 'overused and broken' and then complains when the game doesn't go well for him when he shoots only with his weaker leg. The game is what it is. The rules are what they are. The Pokémon are not going to change.So, you can whine, or you can counter the 'broken strategies'. For instance, if you are really worried about Speed Boost Blaziken, you could counter it in many ways. Priority attacks such as Brave Bird from Talonflame, Aqua Jet from Azumarill, and Fake Out from Mega Kangaskhan work well. So does Trick Room. Intimidate users, Rain/Swift Swim teams and Bulky Water Types are also solid choices. You need to accept that others are going to use whatever they feel will give them the best chance to win, and counter it with your own viable team. Either that, or find something else to do besides competitive Pokémon. :wink:"

2014-06-02T18:59:00-0700,With the release of Pokémon Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire set to be released in the near future- and the X/Y Dex only Format being what is allowed for Competitive Play-Which Pokémon would you like to see on the battle field that has been currently restricted?Metagross?Brongzong?Swampert?Dusknor?What do you think will bring in a new breath of change to the current meta?Which Pokémon do you think should be allowed in the next format?Feel free to toss in your thoughts or wants!
2014-06-03T11:19:53-0700,Game Freak and Nintendo should stop with the restrictions on whats allowed. Its pointless to prevent non native XY Pokemon from being used. They should focus on more balanced play.
2014-06-08T17:27:09-0700,"I am rather sure that X/Y breed Pokémon that get transferred over to ORAS will be able to be used in the new format. Those Pokémon do fall under the ""breed in"" category with a mark, and more then likely ORAS will require the game symbol (if the games continue the symbol and they do opt to keep X/Y blue symbol)-I do not see much of an issue to not want to start breeding for the transfer over.I think the entire reason to have those symbols was a way to track a better history of a Pokemon's ""history"" and to be ""filtered out"" of the older system to in hopes of having a non-hacked atmosphere all- around.Even though it is electronics, and hacks are still around- the best thing to happen is the attempts to weed out the hacked and try to implement a better system to conquer a never ending cycle (but to greatly slow down the process of allowing hacks to get into the competition which is the #1 main concern of the players base IS handling hacked Pokies in battles)- so, over all- I think we can see a rather smoother transition to making the jump to ORAS with less hassle.For example- there should be a compatible way to link the Bank between X/Y to ORAS, and, Bank is a filter as it is- and to me it looks as if people are welcoming the attempts to make the competitive scene ""hack free""- there shouldn't be a step back but steps forward to move on to include the combination of X/Y and ORAS to better the games for everyone.My guess as well that there will be some point in the new games that Bank will not be accessible right away (if so, full dex right off,), but, to be X/Y mixed per say to have access to all the POkies is looking like the format will be expanded into a lager base to break up the meta in allowing more available Pokémon to battle.If they do decide to restrict the format to ORAS for the format and restrict the Pokémon to that dex only- I think there will be a great amount of severe disappointment and a huge step back and IMO it will hurt the game. As I see it, instead of restricting the stratagies to only a select few battle worthy Pokémon to a format is most hurtful and creates a format that is left to a ""stale year"" of seeing the same teams face off due to the lack of strategy out there when there are so many battle worthy Pokémon and so many teams to create- it would be great to see different teams throughout the year then just what is ""meta"" the whole year and being predictable and repetitive.my thoughts, 2 coppers is all--"
2014-06-10T17:11:34-0700,"I still think Speed Boost will rule the meta. On XY right now, I keep losing to teams that abuse it and other Speed/Whatever modifiers. I would like to see speed balanced out. I know that wont happen till the next gen but as of now, speed and power rule the game."
2014-06-10T23:03:27-0700,"The current format is rather heavy on speed and power being the main ""strategy"", because it is what is working for getting wins.That is what has been shown right now that the balance is off, with little options to counter the trend of teams being built to exploit that unbalance.If perhaps a suprise ""7th Gen"" happens, meaning there are added Pokemon to boost the type (single or dual type [maybe a 3 type like poison+dark+grass]) count total (more Fairy, poison, dark..... the types with the lowest count by battle worthy Pokemon)(liike, so many water type Pokemon yet only so many make good for VGC play time)- then there will be even more balance brought in.Just bringing back in all the Pokies that have not been able to be used since it is X/Y dex only, we will have a good amount of balance brought in that it will change up the current meta alot and we will see more team building options for sure if the format expands to include both X/Y and ORAS."

2014-07-03T18:56:19-0700,It might be interesting to create some sort of a multiplayer function other than just battles. Maybe incorporate teamwork into other aspects of the game that way each person who plays with you can bring a different experience.
2014-07-03T22:06:03-0700,"^ I like that- seems like they could incorporate an area in the game that you and a wi-fi friend could team up and battle against the AI like the wi-fi tower battles but in story mode instead.I have been thinking on a game play-style that would have you use like 5 or 6 Pokémon to battle a large Boss Pokémon (legendary Pokémon like Arceus) but not like a final fantasy type, but a first person view in which you are looking through the eyes of a Pokémon on your team to attack the Boss. You would have to move and attack and hit the boss, then ""switch"" your view to another Pokémon to do another attack to help weaken the Boss to capture it.The boss would be in a specific field in which when it attacks, it can hit your Pokémon. You would need like one Pokémon to use say Thunder wave to temporarily stop the boss from moving, then you would need to switch to another to use an attack to lower the hit points of the boss.you would have to travel around of course, and be selective on what pokemon you take to battle the boss pokemon. There would be strategic attacks, the boss would be able to attack multiple pokemon on your team- like for example if you battled Kyogre- you could take a grass pokemon to use say razor leaf to weaken it, then switch to Pikachu to use thunder wave to temporaily stop kyogre so you could attack it with razor leaf. kyogre would be in the water, could dive and surface, use perhaps water gun and surf to hit your pokemon. As the game goes on, the bosses get harder and would require more different pokemon with attacks to figure out how to defeat and capture the boss pokemon.The game could be rather large, as there are so many legend and mini legend pokemon like the bird and dog and regi's, for example.After you capture them, you can transfer them to your current version on the 3ds. and then train and level them up and the what not.As you go on your adventure, you can catch wild pokemon to use in your quest to take on the boss pokemon and transfer them over as well if you wanted to.It would be a way different way to play, but you could easily make a game out of having a pokemon team that you would have to go into 1st person mode and just actually be that pokemon per say through this battle mechanic.meh........................ like I would ever be able to actually be a part of making that possible, but it is cool to come up with ideas and hope, right?"

2014-07-03T18:56:19-0700,It might be interesting to create some sort of a multiplayer function other than just battles. Maybe incorporate teamwork into other aspects of the game that way each person who plays with you can bring a different experience.
2014-07-03T22:06:03-0700,"^ I like that- seems like they could incorporate an area in the game that you and a wi-fi friend could team up and battle against the AI like the wi-fi tower battles but in story mode instead.I have been thinking on a game play-style that would have you use like 5 or 6 Pokémon to battle a large Boss Pokémon (legendary Pokémon like Arceus) but not like a final fantasy type, but a first person view in which you are looking through the eyes of a Pokémon on your team to attack the Boss. You would have to move and attack and hit the boss, then ""switch"" your view to another Pokémon to do another attack to help weaken the Boss to capture it.The boss would be in a specific field in which when it attacks, it can hit your Pokémon. You would need like one Pokémon to use say Thunder wave to temporarily stop the boss from moving, then you would need to switch to another to use an attack to lower the hit points of the boss.you would have to travel around of course, and be selective on what pokemon you take to battle the boss pokemon. There would be strategic attacks, the boss would be able to attack multiple pokemon on your team- like for example if you battled Kyogre- you could take a grass pokemon to use say razor leaf to weaken it, then switch to Pikachu to use thunder wave to temporaily stop kyogre so you could attack it with razor leaf. kyogre would be in the water, could dive and surface, use perhaps water gun and surf to hit your pokemon. As the game goes on, the bosses get harder and would require more different pokemon with attacks to figure out how to defeat and capture the boss pokemon.The game could be rather large, as there are so many legend and mini legend pokemon like the bird and dog and regi's, for example.After you capture them, you can transfer them to your current version on the 3ds. and then train and level them up and the what not.As you go on your adventure, you can catch wild pokemon to use in your quest to take on the boss pokemon and transfer them over as well if you wanted to.It would be a way different way to play, but you could easily make a game out of having a pokemon team that you would have to go into 1st person mode and just actually be that pokemon per say through this battle mechanic.meh........................ like I would ever be able to actually be a part of making that possible, but it is cool to come up with ideas and hope, right?"

Carry a few on you, trade. Heck, I will expand a bit on the idea.The Pokeball figure could be a mobile wonder trade sort of thing. You walk by someone, they have a Pokeball- the trade happens and you get a random trade with out wi-fi or a 3ds.And even though like I said this being an ""if they do mix amiibo with Pokémon games"" sort of discussion and the ""they could make it do this......"" sort of discussion- I would not be surprised if they do nnot already have some sort of plan to make a good full use on a gadget with the top game titles.Heck, look at the Zelda games: a link figuring for a Zelda game to equip or alter weapons (since link carries so many as it is)- look at the possibilities that could be done with the technology for what it can do if they took a different approach to changing how games are played with a player being able to make personal changes in the game to make the playing different each time you play? And you did the changing to it?This allows for the player to build into the game, limited in changing the game itself but the content with in as far as taking like a personal data disk to a friends and plug in your customized character to change up the game play to make it different, add a level, ect..

2014-06-14T21:51:53-0700,"IMO, this could be pretty cool for the tcg, it'd almost be like YGO in a way and how it's depicted in the anime. Whereas they already have Rumble for figurines and stuff otherwise."
2014-06-11T18:24:54-0700,"For Nintendo this time around for this years E3 conference, they introduced a figuring game accessory called ""Amiibo"".Here is the info on it:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK9ip7Z3XjwNow, it does say that they are working on it to work with the 3DS games in the future.Pokémon, being what it is (the best, of course)- what if...............Nintendo decides to incorporate the figures with Pokémon games?What do you all think?"
2014-06-11T20:26:13-0700,"This is something different but they kind of did this with Pokemon Rumble on the Wii U. As for the Pokemon games, I cant think of a way for it to be used effectively."
2014-06-11T23:35:58-0700,"well-This being hypothetical and all if they decide to make use of amiibo with the games- the figures could act as a way to:interact the figuring with other games, like maybe Smash Bro, like, you train your Pokémon in the game, ""transfer it into the figure, then make it playable in Smash Bros.or-some RPG game that allows you to have a Pokémon join your party in the quest.maybe the figurine could be a Pokeball that you can carry it around and then trade it to another person who has a Pokeball without your 3DS.perhaps the figurine could be interactive with the Wii-u and a future game like an XD remake or sequal.I know I am just tossing out thoughts and ideas, or wishing- but this could be a new thing to boost the game play up a bit.Personally- I like my idea of the Pokeball tradeing mechanic. Carry a few on you, trade. Heck, I will expand a bit on the idea.The Pokeball figure could be a mobile wonder trade sort of thing. You walk by someone, they have a Pokeball- the trade happens and you get a random trade with out wi-fi or a 3ds.And even though like I said this being an ""if they do mix amiibo with Pokémon games"" sort of discussion and the ""they could make it do this......"" sort of discussion- I would not be surprised if they do nnot already have some sort of plan to make a good full use on a gadget with the top game titles.Heck, look at the Zelda games: a link figuring for a Zelda game to equip or alter weapons (since link carries so many as it is)- look at the possibilities that could be done with the technology for what it can do if they took a different approach to changing how games are played with a player being able to make personal changes in the game to make the playing different each time you play? And you did the changing to it?This allows for the player to build into the game, limited in changing the game itself but the content with in as far as taking like a personal data disk to a friends and plug in your customized character to change up the game play to make it different, add a level, ect.. I hope you see my point."

2014-06-14T11:03:25-0700,"I am REALLY enjoying the VGC. I currently own Platinum, White 2 and X. Can NOT wait for the new games to come out!While I'm waiting, I thought I'd pick up past games to score any Pokemon that are unable to be captured through the games I currently own. However, I'm having a bit of trouble understanding which pokemon are in which game. When I go to serebii, it seems to say that I can get palkia and dialga through Platinum. So does that mean I don't need to get diamond or pearl?So, a little help would be awesome!Are there any pokemon exclusive to Diamond or Pearl that I cannot live without that I cannot obtain through Platinum?For sure I'm snagging Heartgold and soulsilver, right? Or can I live without one of them (I'm looking at you SS)?Should I pick up Black to get any pokemon that I can't get in White 2?Thanks for the insight! REALLY appreciate it!ken"

2014-05-29T08:23:41-0700,"Nintendo has filed a trademark for Pokemon Delta Emerald in Japan, leading to speculation the old GBA title could be next in line for a remake.Gematsu reports that the trademark was submitted earlier this month but only went public today.

Similarly, when the next two titles resurfaced as Pokemon HeartGold and Pokemon SoulSilver, the updated Pokemon Crystal was left out.Will Delta Emerald be the title to buck this trend and, if so, should we expect to see it alongside Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby later this year, or will the customary gap between the initial two games and their solo-standing follow-up be maintained?

2014-05-29T19:42:33-0700,"Now I have a problem with this. The new R/S game is dubbed as a brand new adventure. This tells me that this new adventure will be completely different, after the events of Team Aqua and Team Magma. With this new adventure, there is no need for a Emerald remake. What they should have done was make Emerald in place of the new R/S game since Emerald is the definitive version of the two. Maybe Im thinking into it too much but a Emerald remake after a remake seems unneeded.This would be the perfect time to make a ultra Pokemon game with each region in it."
2014-05-30T19:49:26-0700,Just remember that they also trademarked other names such as Water Blue.I don't know if they do that to cover bases or what but I don't know if you should get your hopes up...

What they should have done was make Emerald in place of the new R/S game since Emerald is the definitive version of the two. Maybe Im thinking into it too much but a Emerald remake after a remake seems unneeded.This would be the perfect time to make a ultra Pokemon game with each region in it."
2014-05-30T19:49:26-0700,Just remember that they also trademarked other names such as Water Blue.I don't know if they do that to cover bases or what but I don't know if you should get your hopes up...
2014-05-29T08:23:41-0700,"Nintendo has filed a trademark for Pokemon Delta Emerald in Japan, leading to speculation the old GBA title could be next in line for a remake.Gematsu reports that the trademark was submitted earlier this month but only went public today. Seeing as we recently heard about Pokemon Alpha Sapphire and Pokemon Omega Ruby, remastered versions of the GBA classics, it would make sense that their follow-up title wouldn't be far behind.In 2005, and is set in the region of Hoenn. If Delta Emerald comes to pass, it'll mark a step forward in Nintendo's Poke-remake activities.When the company decided to re-release the original two titles as Pokemon Fire Red and Pokemon Leaf Green, the decision was made not to give Pokemon Yellow the same treatment. Similarly, when the next two titles resurfaced as Pokemon HeartGold and Pokemon SoulSilver, the updated Pokemon Crystal was left out.Will Delta Emerald be the title to buck this trend and, if so, should we expect to see it alongside Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby later this year, or will the customary gap between the initial two games and their solo-standing follow-up be maintained? Time will tell.Source : IGN"

2014-03-12T00:27:48-0700,"Whoops, I should have been a little more specific.I meant the ranking that can be found on the Pokemon Global Link website. It displays the top players who participate in Ratings battles, but also shows stats for different Pokemon, such as the top Pokemon used, the attacks that they use, the common equipped items, natures, and abilities, even the most common Pokemon used in battle alongside it, and the Pokemon that commonly beat and are beaten by any specific Pokemon.It's split into 6 different sections, All matches, singles, doubles, triples, rotations, and special (VGC)Again I find it to be a really cool resource that can give a really neat insight into the meta while not just spelling things out for people looking for Pokemon to use. (I'll go ahead a link to it in the first post.)"

If you want to transfer those Pokemon, they must first be changed into the normal form. So you'll have to transfer your Zekrom and Kyruem separately. Then in X/Y when you show a certain NPC Kyurem, they will give you the key item needed to transform into Black/White Kyurem in game. Black/Kyurem cannot be deposited in Pokemon Bank, but you can get them in 6th gen by the method I just said.Edit: Also for the likes of Origin Giratina, there are similar NPCs which you show the Pokemon to to get the special item for the forme change."

I do wish that you could easily alternate between Bank and Transfer, would make life a bit easier.A little nitpick, but the Griseous Orb is found in the Terminus Cave, not from an NPC, but it is true most Pokemon (Keldeo, Meloetta, Kyurem, etc) get the items/moves needed from other NPCs.

2014-02-14T01:01:57-0800,"Transferring from B2W2 was certainly easier than managing BW (no idea why they nerfed mass movements in HGSS and BW) At least it's less time consuming than it was with past gens. I do wish that you could easily alternate between Bank and Transfer, would make life a bit easier.A little nitpick, but the Griseous Orb is found in the Terminus Cave, not from an NPC, but it is true most Pokemon (Keldeo, Meloetta, Kyurem, etc) get the items/moves needed from other NPCs. (Deoxys excluded which uses the meteors in the fossil lab)"
2014-02-05T20:26:44-0800,"Oh man, I gotta say I'm sooo glad that pokebank/transfer is out, so now we can pick up the pokemon from earlier games. However, ... it's such a pain that once everything is done being transfered, I doubt I'll ever want to use it again - except in dire circumstances - for example if I want to restart my Pokemon X game. I find it worse than tedious that it only transfers box 1 of the earlier games, and once you do that, you MUST go to pokebank to move them to where you want to keep them - either to your X/Y game, or to another box on pokebank ONE POKEMON AT A TIME! God Almighty, what a step back from Pokemon Box! Maybe my memory is faulty (correct me if I'm wrong), but at least with that game we could move a box at a time, and more than one box while using the game! That totally sucks. I'd even be happier if we could move a whole row or column of pokemon at a time. This is gonna take me a month to get everything I want where I want them!Not only that, but certain pokemon that were traded to me that I later found out to be hacked pokemon still got through (a level 27 Lugia), and pokemon that I know are definitely totally legal pokemon (Black Kyurem) couldn't be transfered. What a joke. I guess the joke's on us."
2014-02-05T20:45:30-0800,Hit Select twice and you can move a group/whole box of Pokemon at once!
2014-02-06T02:55:41-0800,"Well, that's a bit of relief anyway. Now I just need to remember how to separate Black Kyurem and that will solve most of my problem with it."
2014-02-07T00:25:56-0800,"Certain forms of Pokemon like Origin Giratina and Black/White Kyurem cannot be transferred. If you want to transfer those Pokemon, they must first be changed into the normal form. So you'll have to transfer your Zekrom and Kyruem separately. Then in X/Y when you show a certain NPC Kyurem, they will give you the key item needed to transform into Black/White Kyurem in game. Black/Kyurem cannot be deposited in Pokemon Bank, but you can get them in 6th gen by the method I just said.Edit: Also for the likes of Origin Giratina, there are similar NPCs which you show the Pokemon to to get the special item for the forme change."
2014-02-07T08:09:07-0800,Well that makes sense. Don't a lot of those Pokemon rely on an item to change? And you can't transfer items over.

2014-01-07T10:47:00-0800,"I dont think there is a way. If there is, I cant find it. There is a game chat setting that you can turn on but you have to change that setting on the 3ds parental control setting, which a lot of people dont know about or how to do. If you trade with random people like do when the request pops up, they may not have the setting enabled as its disabled by default. Pokemon XY says they have to be your friend so I dont know if they must be on your list or not.I just wish there was a more aged up 3ds system because I'm a little tired of all of the parental controls and censors.

2014-01-07T12:25:36-0800,"Oooooo, sooo spicy! Sounds somewhat kinky.

Here's one of the latest statements from Nintendo that I found online:""Nintendo and The Pokémon Company International have postponed the launch of Pokémon Bank and Poké Transporter - two software applications that were originally scheduled to launch for Nintendo 3DS on Dec. 27 - due to a large volume of traffic to the Nintendo Network service. Due to the high traffic, players are having trouble setting up Nintendo Network IDs and downloading content in the Nintendo eShop on both Wii U and Nintendo 3DS. We truly regret the inconvenience, and wish to reassure everyone that providing a solution is our top priority. We apologize for the delay and thank you for your continued patience.""Not even a note discussing possible dates when it WILL be online. That sucks."
2013-12-26T23:43:28-0800,I just found this out. How did they not expect this? something that you force on a community to be released on a certain date that people are expecting will be mass downloaded. Their servers should have been able to handle this. OR they could have had the transfer feature BUILT INTO the game like it should have been. Lucky for me I setup my Nintendo ID on my 3ds once I found it out.This is such a shame really. I was really looking forward to this day.
2013-12-27T04:33:19-0800,"It also wasn't hack-checking correctly, from what I've heard. My guess is that they're using the server maintenance to disguise fixing that checking portion."
2013-12-27T08:08:24-0800,Better to not give a date and have it be a pleasant surprise then to give a date prematurely and be wrong at this point.
2013-12-27T09:00:49-0800,"Yeah, I agree with you on this, since real gamers have seen a lot of release delays in the past few years (and are used to it to a certain degree), but .... it would have been better had they gotten it up and running right the first time, and on time as promised. That really is a shame.I had 19 completely full boxes ready to upload from Black (a lot from earlier games like Heartgold, Diamond and Platinum - wish I could have had my Sapphire pokes as well), and 24 mostly full boxes from Black 2."
2013-12-27T10:55:44-0800,I dont think the hack check is the problem. There is nothing they can do in that regard but I think it was the huge updates of Miiverse on the 3DS as a lot of people have not done that and you need to do it to connect to the shop. I just want to get my Pokemon. It should not take this long to transfer pokemon. a complete play through should be enough.
2013-12-27T11:58:34-0800,"Well, I finally was able to access the eShop, but when I found info on PokeBank, it just says ""Release Date: TBD"" Of course TBD means To Be Determined. Not really liking that, but hey, I think it's better that they fix the bugs then release it, than if they let it continue without some assurance that hacked pokemon won't get through. It may not be the problem at this point, but I wish they'd work on it while fixing other stuff too."
2013-12-27T12:03:28-0800,Hacked Pokemon are getting through. Nothing they can do about that without blocking a large number of non native BW/2 Pokemon. I dont think the take down was due to hacks. We have to remember all of nintendo's servers went offline to the huge updates of 3ds systems to support nintendo IDs.
2013-12-27T15:16:48-0800,"I doubt it has anything to do with the software too. Traffic has been insane from what I hear, between Bank, EU getting Super Mario World, and the large influx of new 3DS and Wii U owners, it's probably a case of exceeded expectations. Hopefully that means that sales were amazing this holiday season and with the upcoming maintenance things should return to normal as things are smoothed out."
2013-12-27T15:21:59-0800,I hope so as well. I just really hope the service is up soon. I have a lot of pending battles and such. Guess this gives me time to get my Heal Bell Articuno.
2013-12-27T21:09:26-0800,"Havent posted on here in awhile (since giving up wasting money on cards), but I figured Id share some information.Apparently, when you transfer up from BW/2, it will only transfer Pokemon from box 1. So you have to manually move each Pokemon to box one then upload it. Once uploaded they go into a temp box, then you can sort them into Bank. The temp box must be emptied before uploading more.Also, about the hacks getting through- even though Japan had it for little over a day ( still have it if they got it downloaded), the damage has been done. GTS is riddled with Contrary Snivy's and the like, and pretty much any Pokemon that has been created through outside means as long as it doesnt have stats, attacks or abilities it cant normally have- Hidden Abilities excluded. Also, I have seen pictures of some Pokemon coming across as Kalos native (pentagon symbol in summary), for whatever reason. GF really dropped the ball on this one, and Nintendo did on the server end."
2013-12-27T21:35:58-0800,"Well, thank you NoDice for that info. It's as bad as I first thought. Ok, grin and bear it. Looks like we're gonna have another wonderful mess on our hands and never know if we can fully trust anyone we do a trade with. It doesn't matter now if they make it foolproof for those outside of Japan, since they dropped the ball there first.Not really all that fond of moving just box 1 pokemon only, since that's gonna take me hours upon hours to move all the pokemon from the 40+ boxes I have ready. Wonderful. Just freakin' wonderful. No wonder they have a $4.99 cost for a years worth - who in their right mind would ever want to use it more than they absolutely had to?Guess I better just let it go for tonight. I've had just about enough disappointment for one day. Not really happy with Nintendo/Game Freak/TPC/TPCi and anyone else who might even be remotely tied up with this debacle."
2013-12-28T14:30:46-0800,Someone tried to transfer over a Missingo that was breed with a Porygon that was cloned by a Ditto who had Wonder Guard ability................my bad................................
2013-12-28T15:59:18-0800,"Yeah, the twisted, evil person who posted post #14 was pretty bitter, but I killed him so we can all get on with life."
2013-12-29T19:44:27-0800,"Here's what I posted in another site:It wouldn't be so bad if Nintendo would announce a tentative date on when they hope to see it released, and what they will do about the one month free subscription, however even when trying to find out this info and contact their customer service, the website encountered an error and couldn't fulfill my request. I guess until they come up with at least a little more info, everyone is gonna continue to flood their website and eShop and continue to make the delay longer. Kinda sucks, but that's what happens."
2013-12-31T09:02:24-0800,Still no luck acquiring Bank. This sucks.
2013-12-31T12:46:48-0800,I know. This is kind of a big deal to me. At this point I dont know what to believe anymore. Nintendo's servers are back online so what can the hold up be.
2013-12-31T15:50:01-0800,I believe this warrants a Manaphy release Event.....................................................
2013-12-31T21:52:00-0800,"Yeah, I agree. I too believe a bit of compensation is in order. However recent releases might not necessarily do the trick. I think there was quite a few we missed out on over the years due to geography. It would be nice to have easy access to those pokes now. Mind you, Manaphy was one of the ones I actually got. How about some of the others as well? I could use some of the dreamworld pokes, as well as some of the older releases."
2013-12-31T22:34:04-0800,I say TPCi give us all Lightningrod Zapdos. I'd forgive them over that.
2014-01-01T20:29:26-0800,"Manaphy was only released one time that I can even recall. I did get it, (I think it was TRU Event) but that was so long ago that IMO it is time to release it again.Compensation won't happen since Bank was functional (still is to those who DL'd it before the crash overload) for at least 2 days. Those who have Bank now will get a free ""compensation"" for not being delayed. Fair is fair, right? I myself am disappointed (who isn't right now (besides those who do have it now)) about the delay, but it should not make me feel compensation is required. Yes, I did fire off with the compensation part out of disappointment, but I actually took the time to get more things done on B2 to kill the waiting period. I think it would be more comical to go on the extreme side of humor to say this:""Pokemon Bank Delayed: Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire remakes CONFIRMED!""Cuz I am twisted like that in my humor......................."
2014-01-02T11:33:20-0800,"Iirc, the second and 3rd ranger games had a downloadable mission where you could get manaphy too. That makes it early 2011 when we had the last one. Surely Mew is more in need, hasn't the only official events been 3rd gen and 4th Gen My Pokemon ranch (deposit 1500 pokemon?)."
2014-01-02T12:57:05-0800,"Actually Mew saw another release back during HGSS, as did Jirachi. Personally I think that Darkrai and Shaymin would be the most viable if they did give one away, since they haven't seen an event since their initial their in-game events. (Arceus too, but I think they're probably going to rerelease him with some special event at some point)"
2014-01-02T13:49:59-0800,"I would like to see the game 100 percent complete though. In every pokemon game, they never released the games event Pokemon. Rather then do that, they make new games that still suffer from the same thing. So many missed pokemon and fun events did not happen."
2014-01-03T14:51:23-0800,"The only events that went unused to my knowledge are the Mew event (which did happen in Japan), Arceus and the Lock Capsule (which was a weird event anyway)"
2013-12-26T21:35:09-0800,"However the first thing that came up in the Nintendo eShop was a cruel update screen! Now I honestly thought that I was totally updated after doing the second update already, so I'm assuming this is a third update probably having something to do with Pokebank. Who knows? However I'll keep going and let everyone know what happens.Edit: Once the update was done, I tried to go back to the eShop, and it says that it's currently down for maintenance. I sincerely hope they have lots of servers online soon so it won't crash when everybody tries to download Bank."
2013-12-26T22:10:20-0800,I forgot that was today. Going to get my zappy wappy now.
2013-12-26T23:12:49-0800,"Nope, sorry, you won't. At least not now. Here's one of the latest statements from Nintendo that I found online:""Nintendo and The Pokémon Company International have postponed the launch of Pokémon Bank and Poké Transporter - two software applications that were originally scheduled to launch for Nintendo 3DS on Dec. 27 - due to a large volume of traffic to the Nintendo Network service.

2013-12-22T10:17:46-0800,"Actually for a couple reasons. There's so much Christmas garbage on TV right now (I guess I've moved into the baa humbug stage of my life, having seen it all a few thousand times already), and that Pokemon Bank is just around the corner (less than a week away, now). Anyone else find they are playing their game more now? Are you looking forward to porting over more pokemon from earlier games? Lately I noticed that I have .... like 32 boxes to fit pokemon in on my game, so I'll be using quite a few soon. Anyone know the max number of boxes you can have in the game?"
2013-12-22T11:46:10-0800,"In XY there are only 7 boxes in the game for Pokemon, which I think is a complete rip off considering past Pokemon games had like 18 and the game card can hold a max of 8 gb of data. I think they made it 7 just to sell the Pokemon Bank service. Still cant wait to bring my Pokemon over to XY though."
2013-12-22T11:52:18-0800,"7?!! After playing the game for a while, they add boxes! You must not have very many pokemon. Like I said in the original post - I now have 32 boxes on pokemon X."
2013-12-22T13:21:27-0800,Really? I still have 7.
2013-12-22T16:03:43-0800,Why not try to do some captures on your friend safari? I bet you'll be up there in no time.
2013-12-22T20:27:05-0800,I can do that but all my boxes are like full of small birds.
2013-12-22T23:19:41-0800,"Personally, I'm more focused on catching up on playing Zelda and what not (I recently got a Wii U after my Wii broke about 2 years ago)I do want to get back to X/Y though with the next set of regionals around the cornerExtra boxes (BW-on) are opened after closing the PC with at least one Pokemon in each box. I guess it was done to make it easier to navigate when you don't have as many Pokemon."
2013-12-23T05:18:52-0800,"Be still young padawan. Do or do not, there is no try."
2013-12-23T16:51:45-0800,"Yeah ive got about 300 hours in Y and spent yesterday powering through X so I could get the legendarys. Now I'm spending time trying to power through black 2 cause I can find my white 2 and I want those legendarys. I'm currently soft resetting for a shiny cobalion and may try resetting for shiny of all the legendarys, if its possible to get that legendary shiny."
2013-12-23T20:27:13-0800,"I'm up to 240 hours. To be honest, I haven't spent as much time with my family as I have Pokemon X during the same time period. Hmmm, that's mildly disturbing. Mind you, they have their hobbies and pastimes as well, so I don't feel quite as bad as I would if the kids were small, and needed constant supervision.Good luck on the soft resetting for shiny legendarys. I hope you get at least one. I don't think I'd have the patience for that .... even if I am doing the baa humbug thing. I had hoped that I'd have Pokemon Y by now, but money has been tighter than I'd hoped. So at the moment I'm just concentrating on breeding some good pokemon for a decent team, then probably not long after Pokemon Bank comes out I'll do some more breeding for teams, and then start the EV training. Yeah, I can see me having over 500 hours on this game before getting sick of it. I may just reset Black or Black 2 (Josh has White and White 2) after porting my pokemon over .... just to see if I can get other pokemon I didn't catch the last time, or hey, maybe more legendarys, who knows? Those games weren't entirely terrible, and I didn't mind playing them."
2013-12-23T20:34:35-0800,I'm about to go back and play more on Black 2 as I realized there is a lot I did not do. I just wish Pokemon would release complete games and not release the same things over and over. I'm getting tired of buying new Pokemon game where there is a lot of the game I currently have that has not been unlocked by them. Mainly the even Pokemon already programmed into the game.
2013-12-23T20:45:11-0800,"Yeah ive been breeding a lot as well. I beat the game in 35 hours and after 200 hours of breeding I'm going back to Gen 5(holy jeez at the graphics difference). I'm only gonna do about 50 resets per legendary before I give up with the exceptions being Kyurem(I'm getting shiny kyurem, end of story) and maybe the eon twins."
2013-12-24T12:05:11-0800,"Some of the Pokemon are shiny locked so you cant get them shiny. I was told that Reshiram, Zekrem and maybe Kyurem can't be shiny."
2013-12-24T19:39:49-0800,"Reshriam/Zekrom & Victini are shiny locked. (Oh, how I want a shiny Reshiram. With gold rings...)Kyurem isn't shiny locked."
2013-12-24T20:11:13-0800,Thanks for letting me know. I also want a reshiram with gold wings.
2013-12-31T08:52:07-0800,"I guess I'm gonna have to be content with some form of quad Scyther instead of a quint one. I've tried breeding 5 IV value pokemon from 2 quad valued pokes, and one quad and a 2 IV'd Ditto to the tune of about 300 eggs without any success. I guess it's just a case of bad luck - I just can't seem to breed that last value, no matter what I do. I've gotten the ability I want, and even the nature, ability, and characteristic I want, but not that last IV. Has anyone else encountered this problem with a particular breed of pokemon?"
2013-12-22T10:17:46-0800,"Actually for a couple reasons. There's so much Christmas garbage on TV right now (I guess I've moved into the baa humbug stage of my life, having seen it all a few thousand times already), and that Pokemon Bank is just around the corner (less than a week away, now). Anyone else find they are playing their game more now? Are you looking forward to porting over more pokemon from earlier games? Lately I noticed that I have .... like 32 boxes to fit pokemon in on my game, so I'll be using quite a few soon. Anyone know the max number of boxes you can have in the game?"
2013-12-22T11:46:10-0800,"In XY there are only 7 boxes in the game for Pokemon, which I think is a complete rip off considering past Pokemon games had like 18 and the game card can hold a max of 8 gb of data. I think they made it 7 just to sell the Pokemon Bank service. Still cant wait to bring my Pokemon over to XY though."
2013-12-22T11:52:18-0800,"7?!! After playing the game for a while, they add boxes! You must not have very many pokemon. Like I said in the original post - I now have 32 boxes on pokemon X."
2013-12-22T13:21:27-0800,Really? I still have 7.
2013-12-22T16:03:43-0800,Why not try to do some captures on your friend safari? I bet you'll be up there in no time.
2013-12-22T20:27:05-0800,I can do that but all my boxes are like full of small birds.
2013-12-22T23:19:41-0800,"Personally, I'm more focused on catching up on playing Zelda and what not (I recently got a Wii U after my Wii broke about 2 years ago)I do want to get back to X/Y though with the next set of regionals around the cornerExtra boxes (BW-on) are opened after closing the PC with at least one Pokemon in each box.

2013-11-04T09:42:45-0800,"Sup guys. I'm sure by now, a lot of people may or may not have a competitive team (or at least still testing). And I'm sure some if not all teams have at least one Mega Evolving Pokemon in their midst. I certainly do. I wanted to make a thread about what others have to say about Megas from a competitive standpoint. We all know Mewtwo is arguably the strongest lol, but let's be real and talk about the majority.Just so it's out of the way, I'll write short statements on certain Megas that I have my eye on:Mega Mawile: Mawile went from one of the most forgettable Pokemon to a tiny but mighty competitive Pokemon. Mega Evolution gives it much needed stat boosts and Huge Power is just sweet candy with a good physical movepool.Mega Kangaskhan: This one is worth mentioning; mainly because of it's Ability. Parental Bond allows certain attacks to hit twice, the second attack to my understanding deals less damage than the first. I also came to realize moves like Rock Tomb and Power-Up Punch also dish double the stat changes; Power-up Punch essentially giving a built-in SDance, etc. etc. Not sure if it'll mean much competitively, but it's something I'm keeping an eye on.Mega Manectric: Yet another underwhelming Pokemon made better. While it's design is a bit umm... punkish, its Speed and SpAtk skyrocket to a hefty 135 each. It also gains Intimidate which, in some cases, comes in handy. It's a good special attacker in many ways. it's movepool is shallow but it only need a few moves to wreck shop. Moves like Volt Switch, Thunder, HP Ice, and Flamethrower are part of it's repertoire and of course the standard Thunderbolt.Now enough about my perspective. Let's hear what you guys have to say."
2013-11-04T16:37:45-0800,May I add ways to counter the mega threat or this about how to use the megas on your team?
2013-11-04T17:15:41-0800,"I think Mega Pokemon need to be banned from competitive play because they tend to be overpowered. Reasons. Mega Evolving does not cost anything to use or has no recharge or cool down time. Just Mega Evolve and attack. The changes in their stats also change how the turn counter works if there is a decrease or increase in the speed base stat and Pokemon losing bad typing is what kept most of them from being broken. On top of that, most Pokemon that have Mega Stones dont need to hold items to begin with and benefit from the Mega Stone, gaining more power and losing bad typing. They are cool and all but for competitve play, then need to be banned for the same reason the Lati Twins cant hold Soul Dew and rumor has it that even the Lati Twins will be getting Mega forms."
2013-11-04T17:43:04-0800,"Mega Ampharos has improved imo for several reasons-Mold Breaker cancels several useful abilities, which contains Protean, Sturdy, Natural Cure, Technician, Harvest, Magic Guard, Speed Boost, Huge Power, Contrary, Parental Bond, Shadow Tag, etc.-Electric/Dragon has gained more resistance, which happens to be 4x Electric, Fire, Grass, and Water.-Buffed Satk along with better Def and Sdef-Can be thrown in a Trick Room TeamThe only negatives are-He gained some weaknesses too Ice, Dragon, and Fairy-Slow-Requires some Pokemon to support Ampharos to make him effective.-Shallow movepoolOverall, Ampharos is one of those Pokemon that has tons of unique properties. Because of how impractical he can be in several situations (in terms of the Pokemon your going up against and his natural base stats), you won't see him often because there are better Mega Pokemon out there, and once you use a Mega Stone, you can't use a second one for the remainder of the battle. However, if a player does encounter Ampharos, you can use some of the elements of surprise to your advantage if you play your cards right."
2013-11-05T13:59:45-0800,"I do agree, many are overpowered. But to be honest, some of them needed the boost. Manectric, Houndoom, Mawile, Medicham, a lot of these Pokémon seem weak compared to other Pokémon labeled as overpowered, such as Garchomp or Gengar, even before X&Y. I think a lot of the Pokémon that received Megas needed them to have some competitive merit. Plus there ain't much of a chance Mega Evos will be banned. I mean yeah they're strong, but not so to be banned. And since you can only trigger one Mega per battle this would hold anyone back from using too many, and isn't auto-win just because you use one."
2013-11-11T12:08:37-0800,"I think their relative strength is a bit misleading...let's consider Mega Heracross for example; that big 185 Atk is scary, but in reality, a Guts-boosted Heracross will actually hit harder than it, not to mention it's mega form slower. It also gains a completely different ability in Skill Link, forcing you to run completely different moves if you really want to take advantage of it. Garchomp again loses speed as well when you Mega evolve, and Garchomp's speed tier of 102 is extremely useful in outspeeding other base 100s, now he turns into a bit of a sitting duck against Pokemon like Hydreigon to KO with Draco Meteor that he would otherwise have outsped. Mega Gyarados gains Dark, but loses Flying type and can now be smacked around easily by all those Fighting attacks it used to laugh at. Manetric...well Manetric is still pretty useless, making him a faster and harder hitting Jolteon with Intimidate doesn't really do much.I guess my bottom line is, you give up something to use a mega form in most cases, only a few like Mega Mawile or Kangeshkan are clearly superior and really gain a lot from mega evolving compared to their normal forms. Otherwise in most cases it's basically akin to putting a Life Orb for more damage with no recoil, maybe a speed boost, or adding some bulkiness at the cost of speed. Consider also that they have to hold their mega stone, losing out on other potentially valuable items like Leftovers, Choice Scarf, Sitrus Berry, type-reducing berry, etc. So while powerful when used right, I don't really see them as gamebreaking really."
2013-11-17T04:16:13-0800,"Yeah, I noticed that the mega Ampharos isn't all that good. Perhaps it might have just been the one I have, but I'm not impressed with that compared to ones I had on other games. I'm looking forward to being able to port all my pokemon over near the end of the year. Maybe then I can make a better competitive pokemon with previous versions."
2013-11-17T07:47:43-0800,so I have a quick question should I use mawile or scizor on my team and if I do should I attach a mega stone to them?
2013-11-17T15:57:48-0800,"Kinda depends on what your team is really. As a very basic ""in general"" statement, Mawile prefers TR-oriented teams, while Scizor can usually function well out of them thanks to typing and Bullet Punch, all it needs usually is a SD under its belt to start wrecking things with BP and Bug Bite."
2013-11-17T16:07:11-0800,"Ummm, yeah, I realize I'm a little slow, but could you please repeat that in english? LOL.Please define the following: ""TR-oriented teams,"" ""a SD under its belt,"" and ""BP""Thanks."
2013-11-17T21:09:55-0800,"Lol no problem:BP = Bullet PunchTR = Trick RoomSD = Swords DanceSo basically, Mawile works best in Trick Room since it's speed is bad and it lacks priority moves. Trick Room reverses speed so it becomes one of the faster Pokemon for 5 turns. Scizor, despite only having ok Speed, doesn't need Trick Room since it has a strong priority move in Bullet Punch, which lets it attack first regardless. Combined with Swords Dance to boost its attack, it wrecks havoc on Pokemon that don't resist its moves."
2013-11-18T17:17:48-0800,Mawile gets Sucker Punch. I learned that the hard way. It Took down my Floatzel and Zangoose in one hit and did over 50 percent to my Zapdos.
2013-11-18T19:04:50-0800,"Well, wit Mega's around now- I hope the format does not become stale and repetitious to the meta- with Mega's now, I think there should be no problems with heavily considering that all Pokemon can be playable, with of course a restriction system.Say for a team of 6, bring 6 pick 4-no duplicate hold itemsno duplicate Pokémon1 legendry1 mega stone hold item onlyjust a thought............"
2013-11-18T20:43:19-0800,"Alright next question .... (slightly off topic but not really) what's the best way to raise Scyther for a great Scizor (for use with the mega stone - or not if you think it might be better off without it)? I'm also thinking of natures, characteristics, movesets and if you happen to know it - where to find the best pokemon to raise the effort values for it? I also have access to Pokemon Black and Black 2 if that will help.I've always liked Scizor and Volcarona as inclusions in my teams. Hopefully one of these will be really useful with this format."
2013-11-18T22:04:59-0800,"Duh good point, how did I forget about that...for some reason given its large flytrap, Crunch comes to mind beforehand lol.Honest answer? Breed and raise a Scizor in one of the Black/White 2 carts, so you can get Bug Bite off the Move Tutor. Without it, you're stuck with X-Scissor, which isn't boosted by Technician. Adamant is the way to go for a Nature, probably looking at something like Swords Dance/Bullet Punch/Bug Bite/Protect for a moveset (at least in doubles, for singles you can drop Protect for something like Pursuit or another utility attack). Then whenever Pokebank comes out next month, you can transfer it up. Volcarona should still be pretty useful, with Quiver Dance and its typing, it should still be a powerhouse (just watch out for Rock attacks)."
2013-11-19T08:06:02-0800,Since speed won't really be an issue ... Macho Brace while training Scizor?
2013-11-19T11:22:59-0800,A Power item would give you a lot more EVs faster.
2013-11-20T06:30:35-0800,assuming you have X or Y (maybe both) you have super training so if you have a reset bag (I think that is what it's called) you don't have to worry about the EVs until latter and get them perfect
2013-11-21T12:46:07-0800,"IMO Scizor is plenty fine without his Mega and you're probably better off using another Mega over it. Not saying Mega Scizor is bad, just that Scizor is already good, so might as well invest the Mega into something which can really change a game."
2013-11-24T13:28:17-0800,"Ok, good comment. I feel your opinion is a valid one. So which mega in your opinion is worth it to change up the game?"
2013-11-24T13:50:49-0800,"I like Mega Kangakhan. It seems to be doing well at my school next to Mega Mawile. The most OP set seems to be Power-Up Punch, Earthquake/Return, Sucker Punch and Fake Out."
2013-11-26T00:46:54-0800,"Not really sure quite yet, as I'm just starting to toy around with teams. Mega Kangaskahn and Mega Mawile seem pretty good as previously stated. Mega Banette getting Prankster and Will o Wisp is also very interesting. Mega Gyrados is also pretty interesting with how it becomes bulky, and still retains enough speed to use Dragon Dance to great effect. It really all depends on your team and how they can support each other.As much as I loathe their redundancy for Singles, Mega Abomasnow and Mega Tyranitar could be pretty brutal in Doubles IMO, being able to reactivate their abilities after Mega Charizard's Drought. (Mega Abomasnow becoming even slower is certainly frightening with TR)"
2013-12-18T02:58:39-0800,"I find Mega Gyrados very very interesting-bypassing Rotom's Levitate to EQ it and Aromatisse Aroma Veil if it wants to taunt it. (not 100% on the later, if someone has tested it to confirm it that would be great. But I'm 80-90% sure) Plus, it gets rid of that nasty horrific x4 weakness to Electric. Mega Kang and Mega Mawile are more suited to ""good-stuffs"" teams and are pretty versatile. I think Mega Banette with Prankster Taunt is niche but can function well on a TR team, just eats your Mega evo for the game. A suggested move-set would be something like Will-O-Wisp/Taunt/Knock-Off/Sucker Punch, Protect or Shadow Claw. Mega Charizard Y is alot more powerful under the sun than I expected but I haven't seen that many in action."
2013-12-18T06:57:33-0800,"The problem with M-Gyarados is you give up a lot of what made Gyarados good. Resistance to Grass, Fighting, and immunity to Ground. You Mega-evolve and suddenly that Mach Punch is a lot more threatening. Plus weakness to Fairy? Additionally, Gyarados has a huge variety of items it benefits from. Lum Berry, Sitrus Berry, Life Orb, Leftovers, Shell Bell... all gone if you want the Mega.For comparison:Gyarados:Weaknesses: 2Resistances: 5Immunities: 1M-Gyarados:Weaknesses:Resistances: 6Immunities: 1Not saying it doesn't have uses, and Mold Breaker is an undeniably good ability, but it requires a LOT more careful playing/scouting for threats."
2013-11-04T09:42:45-0800,"Sup guys. I'm sure by now, a lot of people may or may not have a competitive team (or at least still testing). And I'm sure some if not all teams have at least one Mega Evolving Pokemon in their midst. I certainly do. I wanted to make a thread about what others have to say about Megas from a competitive standpoint. We all know Mewtwo is arguably the strongest lol, but let's be real and talk about the majority.Just so it's out of the way, I'll write short statements on certain Megas that I have my eye on:Mega Mawile: Mawile went from one of the most forgettable Pokemon to a tiny but mighty competitive Pokemon. Mega Evolution gives it much needed stat boosts and Huge Power is just sweet candy with a good physical movepool.Mega Kangaskhan: This one is worth mentioning; mainly because of it's Ability. Parental Bond allows certain attacks to hit twice, the second attack to my understanding deals less damage than the first. I also came to realize moves like Rock Tomb and Power-Up Punch also dish double the stat changes; Power-up Punch essentially giving a built-in SDance, etc. etc. Not sure if it'll mean much competitively, but it's something I'm keeping an eye on.Mega Manectric: Yet another underwhelming Pokemon made better. While it's design is a bit umm... punkish, its Speed and SpAtk skyrocket to a hefty 135 each. It also gains Intimidate which, in some cases, comes in handy. It's a good special attacker in many ways. it's movepool is shallow but it only need a few moves to wreck shop. Moves like Volt Switch, Thunder, HP Ice, and Flamethrower are part of it's repertoire and of course the standard Thunderbolt.Now enough about my perspective. Let's hear what you guys have to say."
2013-11-04T16:37:45-0800,May I add ways to counter the mega threat or this about how to use the megas on your team?
2013-11-04T17:15:41-0800,"I think Mega Pokemon need to be banned from competitive play because they tend to be overpowered. Reasons. Mega Evolving does not cost anything to use or has no recharge or cool down time. Just Mega Evolve and attack. The changes in their stats also change how the turn counter works if there is a decrease or increase in the speed base stat and Pokemon losing bad typing is what kept most of them from being broken. On top of that, most Pokemon that have Mega Stones dont need to hold items to begin with and benefit from the Mega Stone, gaining more power and losing bad typing. They are cool and all but for competitve play, then need to be banned for the same reason the Lati Twins cant hold Soul Dew and rumor has it that even the Lati Twins will be getting Mega forms."
2013-11-04T17:43:04-0800,"Mega Ampharos has improved imo for several reasons-Mold Breaker cancels several useful abilities, which contains Protean, Sturdy, Natural Cure, Technician, Harvest, Magic Guard, Speed Boost, Huge Power, Contrary, Parental Bond, Shadow Tag, etc.-Electric/Dragon has gained more resistance, which happens to be 4x Electric, Fire, Grass, and Water.-Buffed Satk along with better Def and Sdef-Can be thrown in a Trick Room TeamThe only negatives are-He gained some weaknesses too Ice, Dragon, and Fairy-Slow-Requires some Pokemon to support Ampharos to make him effective.-Shallow movepoolOverall, Ampharos is one of those Pokemon that has tons of unique properties. Because of how impractical he can be in several situations (in terms of the Pokemon your going up against and his natural base stats), you won't see him often because there are better Mega Pokemon out there, and once you use a Mega Stone, you can't use a second one for the remainder of the battle. However, if a player does encounter Ampharos, you can use some of the elements of surprise to your advantage if you play your cards right."
2013-11-05T13:59:45-0800,"I do agree, many are overpowered. But to be honest, some of them needed the boost. Manectric, Houndoom, Mawile, Medicham, a lot of these Pokémon seem weak compared to other Pokémon labeled as overpowered, such as Garchomp or Gengar, even before X&Y. I think a lot of the Pokémon that received Megas needed them to have some competitive merit. Plus there ain't much of a chance Mega Evos will be banned. I mean yeah they're strong, but not so to be banned. And since you can only trigger one Mega per battle this would hold anyone back from using too many, and isn't auto-win just because you use one."
2013-11-11T12:08:37-0800,"I think their relative strength is a bit misleading...let's consider Mega Heracross for example; that big 185 Atk is scary, but in reality, a Guts-boosted Heracross will actually hit harder than it, not to mention it's mega form slower. It also gains a completely different ability in Skill Link, forcing you to run completely different moves if you really want to take advantage of it. Garchomp again loses speed as well when you Mega evolve, and Garchomp's speed tier of 102 is extremely useful in outspeeding other base 100s, now he turns into a bit of a sitting duck against Pokemon like Hydreigon to KO with Draco Meteor that he would otherwise have outsped. Mega Gyarados gains Dark, but loses Flying type and can now be smacked around easily by all those Fighting attacks it used to laugh at. Manetric...well Manetric is still pretty useless, making him a faster and harder hitting Jolteon with Intimidate doesn't really do much.I guess my bottom line is, you give up something to use a mega form in most cases, only a few like Mega Mawile or Kangeshkan are clearly superior and really gain a lot from mega evolving compared to their normal forms. Otherwise in most cases it's basically akin to putting a Life Orb for more damage with no recoil, maybe a speed boost, or adding some bulkiness at the cost of speed. Consider also that they have to hold their mega stone, losing out on other potentially valuable items like Leftovers, Choice Scarf, Sitrus Berry, type-reducing berry, etc. So while powerful when used right, I don't really see them as gamebreaking really."
2013-11-17T04:16:13-0800,"Yeah, I noticed that the mega Ampharos isn't all that good. Perhaps it might have just been the one I have, but I'm not impressed with that compared to ones I had on other games. I'm looking forward to being able to port all my pokemon over near the end of the year. Maybe then I can make a better competitive pokemon with previous versions."
2013-11-17T07:47:43-0800,so I have a quick question should I use mawile or scizor on my team and if I do should I attach a mega stone to them?
2013-11-17T15:57:48-0800,"Kinda depends on what your team is really. As a very basic ""in general"" statement, Mawile prefers TR-oriented teams, while Scizor can usually function well out of them thanks to typing and Bullet Punch, all it needs usually is a SD under its belt to start wrecking things with BP and Bug Bite."
2013-11-17T16:07:11-0800,"Ummm, yeah, I realize I'm a little slow, but could you please repeat that in english? LOL.Please define the following: ""TR-oriented teams,"" ""a SD under its belt,"" and ""BP""Thanks."
2013-11-17T21:09:55-0800,"Lol no problem:BP = Bullet PunchTR = Trick RoomSD = Swords DanceSo basically, Mawile works best in Trick Room since it's speed is bad and it lacks priority moves. Trick Room reverses speed so it becomes one of the faster Pokemon for 5 turns. Scizor, despite only having ok Speed, doesn't need Trick Room since it has a strong priority move in Bullet Punch, which lets it attack first regardless. Combined with Swords Dance to boost its attack, it wrecks havoc on Pokemon that don't resist its moves."
2013-11-18T17:17:48-0800,Mawile gets Sucker Punch. I learned that the hard way. It Took down my Floatzel and Zangoose in one hit and did over 50 percent to my Zapdos.
2013-11-18T19:04:50-0800,"Well, wit Mega's around now- I hope the format does not become stale and repetitious to the meta- with Mega's now, I think there should be no problems with heavily considering that all Pokemon can be playable, with of course a restriction system.Say for a team of 6, bring 6 pick 4-no duplicate hold itemsno duplicate Pokémon1 legendry1 mega stone hold item onlyjust a thought............"
2013-11-18T20:43:19-0800,"Alright next question .... (slightly off topic but not really) what's the best way to raise Scyther for a great Scizor (for use with the mega stone - or not if you think it might be better off without it)? I'm also thinking of natures, characteristics, movesets and if you happen to know it - where to find the best pokemon to raise the effort values for it? I also have access to Pokemon Black and Black 2 if that will help.I've always liked Scizor and Volcarona as inclusions in my teams. Hopefully one of these will be really useful with this format."
2013-11-18T22:04:59-0800,"Duh good point, how did I forget about that...for some reason given its large flytrap, Crunch comes to mind beforehand lol.Honest answer? Breed and raise a Scizor in one of the Black/White 2 carts, so you can get Bug Bite off the Move Tutor. Without it, you're stuck with X-Scissor, which isn't boosted by Technician. Adamant is the way to go for a Nature, probably looking at something like Swords Dance/Bullet Punch/Bug Bite/Protect for a moveset (at least in doubles, for singles you can drop Protect for something like Pursuit or another utility attack). Then whenever Pokebank comes out next month, you can transfer it up. Volcarona should still be pretty useful, with Quiver Dance and its typing, it should still be a powerhouse (just watch out for Rock attacks)."
2013-11-19T08:06:02-0800,Since speed won't really be an issue ... Macho Brace while training Scizor?
2013-11-19T11:22:59-0800,A Power item would give you a lot more EVs faster.
2013-11-20T06:30:35-0800,assuming you have X or Y (maybe both) you have super training so if you have a reset bag (I think that is what it's called) you don't have to worry about the EVs until latter and get them perfect
2013-11-21T12:46:07-0800,"IMO Scizor is plenty fine without his Mega and you're probably better off using another Mega over it. Not saying Mega Scizor is bad, just that Scizor is already good, so might as well invest the Mega into something which can really change a game."
2013-11-24T13:28:17-0800,"Ok, good comment. I feel your opinion is a valid one. So which mega in your opinion is worth it to change up the game?"
2013-11-24T13:50:49-0800,"I like Mega Kangakhan. It seems to be doing well at my school next to Mega Mawile. The most OP set seems to be Power-Up Punch, Earthquake/Return, Sucker Punch and Fake Out."
2013-11-26T00:46:54-0800,"Not really sure quite yet, as I'm just starting to toy around with teams. Mega Kangaskahn and Mega Mawile seem pretty good as previously stated. Mega Banette getting Prankster and Will o Wisp is also very interesting. Mega Gyrados is also pretty interesting with how it becomes bulky, and still retains enough speed to use Dragon Dance to great effect. It really all depends on your team and how they can support each other.As much as I loathe their redundancy for Singles, Mega Abomasnow and Mega Tyranitar could be pretty brutal in Doubles IMO, being able to reactivate their abilities after Mega Charizard's Drought.

I had no idea that you could get it in X, so I was just exploring in Terminus Cave, more or less minding my own business trying to find some pokemon that I might have missed, and I practically bumped into it! I'm wondering what it is, so I save my game just in case, and then went to town on it. I had a Master ball available, but I figured I'd try without it. It took about 25 timer balls, and about 10 other types, but I finally caught it.Then shortly after that, Moltres flew in and then fled. I'm off to see the wizard to see if he has any words of wisdom for catching some more cool pokemon!EDIT: Yeah, I don't know why, but I was under the impression you might not be able to get that legendary until Pokemon Z came out!

2013-11-02T13:32:20-0700,I like my special Zapdos. It having bad speed and special attack IVs make it unique. But I perfer the 31s in HP and Defense I guess. Still I cant wait to get my perfect Zapdos in the game.
2013-11-03T01:54:15-0800,"I won't lie, if I had known before that the bird trio were tied to your starters, would've dropped Froakie in a heartbeat for Fennekin because let's face it, Zapdos is the only worthwhile legendary bird."

Of course if you dont mind using Roost, Thunderbolt, Volt Switch and Light Screen, then go and get yourself a Zapdos."

2013-12-17T07:08:37-0800,"You do know you could have checked your Zapdos and kept catching it again and again until you got the one you wanted right?I realize you could have kept catching it until you got what you wanted, but to get a ""PERFECT"" Zapdos? That might be a bit hard wouldn't it?"
2013-12-17T10:35:42-0800,I know I could have. I planned on doing that but I already have like 5 perfect zapdos. This is just one to get me by until I get my pokes from black 2.
2013-12-17T16:40:32-0800,How did you end up getting 5 perfect Zapdos? Isn't that something like asking for a perfect spouse? LOL. Hope my wife doesn't see this post!
2013-11-01T19:13:36-0700,"Holy X-Men, Batman! I had no idea that you could get it in X, so I was just exploring in Terminus Cave, more or less minding my own business trying to find some pokemon that I might have missed, and I practically bumped into it! I'm wondering what it is, so I save my game just in case, and then went to town on it. I had a Master ball available, but I figured I'd try without it. It took about 25 timer balls, and about 10 other types, but I finally caught it.Then shortly after that, Moltres flew in and then fled. I'm off to see the wizard to see if he has any words of wisdom for catching some more cool pokemon!EDIT: Yeah, I don't know why, but I was under the impression you might not be able to get that legendary until Pokemon Z came out!

2013-11-01T20:39:41-0700,My main gripe is there is not much else to do once you finish the game. I was super happy to run into zapdos. It had a timid nature and 3 31 IVs in the wrong stats. It makes it special though.

Even a few games on the game counsel have pointless or off style tunes to them.A game like Zelda- now- those games have an awesome soundtrack.

2013-11-22T17:35:47-0800,Today the format for the Gen VI games X&Y have been announced. Here is a quick summary:So there you have it; the VGC format for our upcoming Regionals!Source:http://assets22.pokemon.com/assets/...14/Play_Pokemon_VG_Rules_and_Formats_2014.pdf~Cyber~
2013-11-22T18:29:04-0800,"Will be different for sure, especially since Dark Void Smeargle is free to try terrorizing opponents again."
2013-11-22T18:35:09-0800,"For those of you who are wanting to know-Each Pokémon caught or breed in X/Y have a blue colored Pentagon shaped symbol in the ""summery"" drop down menu window.Here is an image of a X/Y Pokémon screen shot image:http://images.search.yahoo.com/imag...57lm&sigi=12t33tf0d&.crumb=U4FDbk05wEM&fr=w3iThat little blue symbol just below Fenniken just left of the 6 ""marking"" symbols is what is required to accompany the Pokémon you will use in the battles.Without that symbol= you may not use that Pokémon as it did not originate from an X/Y game cartridge."
2013-11-22T22:46:35-0800,"So Zapdos is destine to be bad for VGC then. Are these rules only for the first tournament or is this forever. If this is true, I'm not playing this game anymore. I spent WAY too much time raising my Pokemon."
2013-11-23T04:35:35-0800,Great. This means I'm going to have to breed an entire team of Pokemon for this championship. Do you know how time-consuming (and unfair) that is?- Croatian_Nidoking
2013-11-23T10:48:32-0800,"It may be time consuming and seem unfair that you may not be able to use transported Pokémon- this is a price we need to pay for the new implementation of trying to stop cheating in the tournaments.Here are some ways to quicken the pace to get a team of 6:Partner up with a friend and do this--You breed for a Pokémon they want, and they do the same for you. This way you both can trade those breed Pokémon. REASON: Traded Pokémon gain experience faster, and feel free to use the Lucky Egg.This will cut down time, since you are not raising a Pokémon that will not gain the average pace of leveling up.Use Feathers, Vitamins, and Power training to get the EV's faster.Breed with SZ Pokémon, use the Destiny Knot and Power Bracelets when breeding. Toss in the Everstone.Find hordes to boost the EV's obtained when EV training.Use Pokerus (it is out there, finding a person who has it and will trade a Pokie with it is rather easy)You only need to raise a Pokémon to level 50- if you EV it at level 1 using all the newer methods and techs- you will have a battle worthy Pokémon in less time you think.Look- it does stink to have to switch over to the new- but this switch over to the new is a major step into the best direction for the competitive scene.I should write up an article on how to bust out a tourney worthy Pokémon in no time with all the new mechs and techs in the game............."
2013-11-23T11:11:28-0800,"The biggest deal for this is most of the Pokemon I use are not good in Gen 6 because of the lack of good move tutors. I also work and go to school full time AND I'm working on a movie that will keep me busy for 3+ years. I do not have the time to breed and train new Pokemon. This also makes the Pokemon Bank software worth absolutely worthless because nothing we bring over can't be used for anything official. They need to kill that rule with fire because its completely unfair for players who spent the time, energy and/or money to play someone to train Pokemon."
2013-11-23T11:11:44-0800,"I feel your pain C_N_ and Vaporeon. I put a lot of work into some of my pokemon that I'd hoped I'd be able to use once pokebank was up and running as well. Unfortunately even though I don't like to do so, occasionally I have to play the devil's advocate. I guess it's like any of our (somewhat) yearly modified announcements for the trading card game. Sure, it nerfs all the effort experienced pokemon players have put in on their past teams, but it also gives a lot of new players the opportunity to be on the same playing field. I sincerely doubt anyone who has been playing since Blue and Red will be entirely happy with this announcement, but at least they have some resources to work with to stay somewhat competitive. TPCi more or less is counting on their continued playing .... whether they like the announcement or not. Let's face it, most of us here have been playing for years. We're probably not going to quit due to a newly introduced ripple. We'll just grumble a bit and carry on .... and find a way to do our best with what we have to work with. The bottom line is that all players will be on the same equal footing. It's not necessarily fun for all, but bottom line .... it's fair.Just so you know however, I have the pokerus, and have given it to a lot of Dittos that I've harvested from the Friend Safari - many of which have maxed out IV's. I'm willing to supply those to friends here on the gym as a service .... more or less free of charge. Just put in my friend code and pm me that you've done so. Give me your code as well, and we can find a time to trade whatever you like for them. If you can help me out, great, but that's not why I'm doing it. I'm only doing this as a favor to everyone here."
2013-11-23T11:26:36-0800,"This rule effectively ruins a lot of people because XY lacks what the past Gens had. With my current work load, I can't train my pokemon again. There are way too many of them to take on. I have no reason to continue to play pokemon competitively anymore. Its like they are trying to force out older players."
2013-11-23T14:19:54-0800,"It could be possible that a ""test run"" is being done to make certain that the new system works. When you transfer over, the system is (to my understanding) going to filter out cheated/hacked Pokémon. Things like level 9 Dialga's and the sort.When people ask for ""fair""- you will need to understand and accept the changes made to accomplish that goal of fairness across the board.Change is supposed to be good- and not everyone likes change. Understandable. But look at the changes being made and what is requested with in those changes that were made.You want to battle via wi-fi? You really want to lose to a hacked/cheated team? Would you like to see more wi-fi tournies with prizes?Sure- I am losing a great amount of past work on Pokies I breed for tournies. But after these changes- it outweighs the many times my own personal hard ork went down the drain to a hacked/cheated team.I agree with P_A - This change should have come a long time ago. But thee had to be enough support an demand for more fairness in the VGC scene.This is a victory to those who do not cheat/hack. All of you past work is not wasted- it made you a better competitive player all around.I have played since the Red/Blue days................ and have many a times defeated cheated/hacked teams all around.This is a change that has transferred the TCG's ""Spirit of the game"" aspect into our domain, our turf of knowing what we have all been striving forward with to make our efforts to not only build the best team with an undefeated strategy into a reward that is backed by TCPI.

That cart has many years of transfer/event/breed/ - you name it-- on there.I take pride in knowing all of my stuff is legit, and my histories and victories are proof that I have what it takes to be one among the best trainers and battles out there.Sure- I do not compete for trading in that for staffing- but- I can still hang with the best and know that at least the effort and changes are with the intentions for the better t the VGC.I have not liked many changes to what is allowed in the changing formats- but, I still pull through in one way shape form or another.You all are no alone, ad people such as myself are out there and willing to assist you fellow VG'rs out.Look at it this way:I like to help, because I know that if you have had my help- I know that in return you will give me a great battle. And if you make it to take 1st place in a tourney and I helped you- I can share in that victory a little.I am going to be some old man one day day who can look back and laugh at this change and complain some about more new changes-but those changes will not take the trainer away from me since the game brings me the type of gaming I enjoy.I simply will ""drudge through"" these changes like I have in the past- but knowing that more efforts are being done to keep me from being ripped off of a victory and my time is truly wasted-I will take this change in a heart beat because losing to a cheater who wasted my time is way worse then the format change at hand.Not being a suck-up when I say this- but thanks TCPI/Nintendo/Gamefreak for listening to the player base. A victory over cheating and hacking at this time is far better then a small complaint in the changes to the format."
2013-11-23T15:14:08-0800,Its not fair for use collage students who do school full time and or work. We all have other projects we are working on to make money in our lives and them not allowing us to use the Pokemon we spent years raising places us at a disadvantage. This is thousands of people who are affected by that sentence. Hack checks have always been in place and the games are getting better at finding them. It feels like they are selling out just about every adult who plays competitively.
2013-11-23T17:17:10-0800,"Stick'd the information, leaving this one open for discussion."
2013-11-23T21:36:18-0800,"It also isn't fair for new players who haven't invested as much time in the games as veteran players who have more at their disposal.I'm personally in favor of this as it a.) stops old hacked Pokemon, and b.) gives a chance to players who were once dissuaded from playing due to the complexities of raising a team. This way everyone is on even ground, plus with the current IV breeding mechanincs you can easily replicate most Pokemon, meaning you won't be in for as much of a time sink anyway. (took me less than a day to get a satisfactory Greninja with 5 IVs, and I had to build up to that)This is probably only this year's format anyway, as with the first BW format there restrictions to only BW Pokemon, and obviously that didn't last."
2013-11-24T13:32:18-0800,I don't think so...
2013-11-24T13:56:47-0800,"I dont have a problem with this being the rules for the first tournament but there is nothing saying these rules will change after, which is a pretty big deal. As for it being fair, its not fair for those who already did the work. You for one should know I'm all about fair play for all but cutting out a age group who does not have the time to train and breed anymore is far from fair.Now, I do know I can still use my Pokemon in causal play with friends, which I intend to do, but I want to use them competitively. Many of my Pokemon have been around since Gen 3 and I still use them. They mean a lot to me then just data on a cart. A lot of the changes Pokemon has been making are affecting my personal life and I'm starting to feel alienated. I'm sure I'm not the only who who feels this way."
2013-11-24T14:06:29-0800,"Then the secret to happiness Vaporeon is not to take it so personally. Perhaps it might be good to step back, distance yourself from the situation, so you can see things in a different light. I had to do that. It was worth it."
2013-11-24T14:20:24-0800,Perhaps I need to do that. Its hard to do though when its something you care passionately about.
2013-11-24T14:53:15-0800,"I do share that ""it is not just data"" bit to some degree of attatchment. Normal to do so when passion is involved.The one thing that keeps me from being so ""dislike"" for the new changes:Passion does not care about changes by way of obstacles that you know you can adjust to in remaining happy and deriving that happiness based on the original reason to be passionate about something in the first place."
2013-11-24T18:05:19-0800,"You do realize that the rules pretty much support it being legal? Dark Void is a move learned by Darkrai, an officially released event Pokemon. Smeargle learns Sketch, an in-game move. Breed your Smeargle in XY, transfer Darkrai via Pokebank, Sketch Dark Void. That's why they normally specifically ban moves like Dark Void, because while Darkrai is normally banned and it's the only Pokemon that naturally learns it, Smeargle can Sketch it to have it."
2013-11-25T00:20:37-0800,"I'll point out again that VGC changes rules pretty often, last year was the first to keep them consistent."
2013-11-25T18:02:40-0800,"Yeah, who knows, maybe by the time US Nats rolls around they may have already changed some rules. Maybe Dark void will go back in the void."
2013-11-25T20:08:32-0800,I highly doubt that Dark Void is going to be such a game breaker attack like it has been in the past.Dark Void is nothing to concern yourself with being able to have 6 Mega Pokémon in your party.Dark Void may have been an issue for past formats- but your going to be staring down a whole new double barrel semi-automatic sawed off shot gun with dual banana clips holding triple-ot buck rounds with the Mega Pokémon like Mawile.................. you ready to face that and the Lum berry combo?
2013-11-25T21:45:07-0800,The game is still hard hitting and double sleep will always cause problems.
2013-11-28T11:50:45-0800,"^ Mega Absol will eat Smeargle using Dark Void. Plus, many Pokémon out speed Smeargle as it is, unless you Scarf the Smeargle.Plenty of options out there to avoid the void- I still do not see how anyone can NOT prepare for a Dark Void in their team--heck- you see a Smeargle on the opposing team- auto assume a DV and bring a Lum Berry in and cripple Smeargle if you are that ""fearing"" of a Smeargle.All I got to answer to the issue....................."
2013-11-28T12:25:36-0800,I always assume they carry DV. Its why I run safeguard on my moltres for doubles but because options exist does not mean some things need to be banned. The idea is to not force people to run fast pokemon to stop one thing.
2013-11-28T13:26:48-0800,"Smeargle has a Base 75 Speed, which is pretty much the worst possible speed possible. It's too slow to outrun pretty much anything competitive, and to fast for TR. Plus its defenses are shallow enough that a priority move should be able to decimate it normally, and one should always have a Priority move handy anyway, so I don't really see how its THAT threatening."
2013-12-02T01:15:27-0800,"The main trouble with Smeargle (at least from a casual team standpoint) is that most will likely run around with Focus Sash, so unless you double target it, target+spread move, or have a multi-hit move, it will likely get off a Dark Void; add in that a Follow Me/Rage Powder user can attract any initial attacks and KOing one on sight isn't always possible.But that being said, again the format is a lot different now. Some Pokemon have access to Prankster Safeguard, Safeguard itself isn't a one-use TM oddity and is available to a lot more Pokemon, Insomnia users, and of course just defeating it with good old Lum/Chesto. Sleep itself only lasts 3 turns max and sleep counters don't reset if you swap out. So it's definitely more manageable in a nerfed form, though overall it's still pretty disruptive if you don't plan your team properly in the first place to handle whatever could be thrown at it."
2013-12-02T18:20:31-0800,Gourgiest- another Pokémon that will destroy Smeargle. -- Interesting thing about this Ghost/Grass Pokémon is that it learns Fire type attacks.I still do not understand how Smeargle is going to be such a big threat this format...........
2013-12-02T19:21:35-0800,"Gourgiest has been looking pretty interesting to me. The biggest version has low enough speed to take advantage of Trick Room, and a sizable attack, not to mention it gets Phantom Force which can break through Protect."
2013-12-02T21:46:34-0800,"Just remember, Insomnia is its hidden ability. The only way to get a HA one is through FS. And all FS Pumpkaboo are average size, which is the lame size......yeah I already tried looking at it. Lum can stop Dark Void, but you're better off with Trevenant then since it can recycle Lum thanks to Harvest and has a better variety of attacks."
2013-12-03T03:30:10-0800,"Ok, I understand FS which is ""Friend Safari"" since I use that a lot, but what's the meaning of ""HA""Whatever happened to writing posts so everyone can read and understand them? It's almost like you're writing in code. You may have a helpful post but I can't thank you for it if I don't understand it."
2013-12-03T07:03:14-0800,"HA stands for Hidden Ability, like Blaziken's speed boost.I haven't really done breeding with Pumpkaboo yet, does the baby depend on the parent, and if so can't you breed it with an Extra Large to get an Extra Large with Insomnia?"
2013-12-03T08:40:43-0800,"That's correct. Ball, Ability (60%), and Size are all inherited from the mother. The only time the size is inherited from the father is when you're breeding with Ditto."
2013-12-03T10:55:16-0800,"Guess that means Extra Large is stuck with Frisk then, tis a shame really.BTW what do you mean by ball?"
2013-12-03T11:38:55-0800,"The Pokeball the parent is caught in. So say you catch a female Pumpkaboo in a Dusk Ball, its offspring will all be in Dusk Balls as opposed to a plain old Pokeball."
2013-12-03T11:51:26-0800,I thought he was referring to some other mechanic or some reason.
2013-12-05T10:04:47-0800,"You only get one mega per battle...plus all the megas except Absol and Banette are even MORE vulnerable to DV than everything else since they can't hold Lum or Chesto, they just get slept for free. Not sure what game you're even talking about there.A large about of doubles-viable Pokemon sit at 70 base speed so Smeargle is actually annoyingly fast by comparison, plus unless you're 88 base speed or over you have to run a +speed nature to outrun it, which a lot of Pokemon (Gardevoir, Toxicroak) don't particularly want to be doing. This also includes having to run +Speed on scarf sets and wind up losing power against everything else in the game just to not get slept by scarf Smeargle.Also Moody is really awful to have to fight on top of Dark Void and makes a bunch of classic anti-Smeargle strats not guaranteed. Simply outspeeding it doesn't work if it gets +2 Speed, praying for a miss is out the window once it gets +2 accuracy, and absorbing Dark Void with Lum or Chesto and KOing it will fail 40% of the time if it gets +2 evasion. Unless you're using Lum/Prankster + Safeguard or terrain or Slurpuff or something Smeargle can always find a way to give you crap if it gets good rolls."
2013-12-06T13:45:43-0800,^ Absol's Magic Bounce ability will reflect DV- therefore not a problem and thus why I do not think Smeargle is a big threat in that case.
2013-12-06T13:51:49-0800,"That is true but do you run MB Absol on your team and pokemon with Lum/ abilities to prevent sleep? Not everyone will do this but a move that auto sleeps half a team should be banned. Like Sixonesix said, anyone who wants to do this will make a team that can abuse it."
2013-12-06T14:00:30-0800,"Well, not looking to debate or continue to toss out strategies for countering DV- but- if TCPI didn't think that it was that game broken they would have banned it.Looks as if the attempt to get people to break away from the over used and the common team builds will sub come to the threat of DV then..............As far as ""What game are you playing?"" in regards to the new format- I never play the common meta as it is, so, my skills are what my main weapon is--"
2013-12-08T16:50:50-0800,"Not all players run a counter for TR either, but it's not banned either. There's plenty of ways to get around Smeargle DV, you can hit it twice in one turn to KO it (not hard with moves like Surf and EQ) or you can run Lum berry or Insomnia, you could even run Sleep Talk. There's plenty of ways around it."
2013-11-22T17:35:47-0800,Today the format for the Gen VI games X&Y have been announced. Here is a quick summary:So there you have it; the VGC format for our upcoming Regionals!Source:http://assets22.pokemon.com/assets/...14/Play_Pokemon_VG_Rules_and_Formats_2014.pdf~Cyber~
2013-11-22T18:29:04-0800,"Will be different for sure, especially since Dark Void Smeargle is free to try terrorizing opponents again."
2013-11-22T18:35:09-0800,"For those of you who are wanting to know-Each Pokémon caught or breed in X/Y have a blue colored Pentagon shaped symbol in the ""summery"" drop down menu window.Here is an image of a X/Y Pokémon screen shot image:http://images.search.yahoo.com/imag...57lm&sigi=12t33tf0d&.crumb=U4FDbk05wEM&fr=w3iThat little blue symbol just below Fenniken just left of the 6 ""marking"" symbols is what is required to accompany the Pokémon you will use in the battles.Without that symbol= you may not use that Pokémon as it did not originate from an X/Y game cartridge."
2013-11-22T22:46:35-0800,"So Zapdos is destine to be bad for VGC then. Are these rules only for the first tournament or is this forever. If this is true, I'm not playing this game anymore. I spent WAY too much time raising my Pokemon."
2013-11-23T04:35:35-0800,Great. This means I'm going to have to breed an entire team of Pokemon for this championship. Do you know how time-consuming (and unfair) that is?- Croatian_Nidoking
2013-11-23T10:48:32-0800,"It may be time consuming and seem unfair that you may not be able to use transported Pokémon- this is a price we need to pay for the new implementation of trying to stop cheating in the tournaments.Here are some ways to quicken the pace to get a team of 6:Partner up with a friend and do this--You breed for a Pokémon they want, and they do the same for you. This way you both can trade those breed Pokémon. REASON: Traded Pokémon gain experience faster, and feel free to use the Lucky Egg.This will cut down time, since you are not raising a Pokémon that will not gain the average pace of leveling up.Use Feathers, Vitamins, and Power training to get the EV's faster.Breed with SZ Pokémon, use the Destiny Knot and Power Bracelets when breeding. Toss in the Everstone.Find hordes to boost the EV's obtained when EV training.Use Pokerus (it is out there, finding a person who has it and will trade a Pokie with it is rather easy)You only need to raise a Pokémon to level 50- if you EV it at level 1 using all the newer methods and techs- you will have a battle worthy Pokémon in less time you think.Look- it does stink to have to switch over to the new- but this switch over to the new is a major step into the best direction for the competitive scene.I should write up an article on how to bust out a tourney worthy Pokémon in no time with all the new mechs and techs in the game............."
2013-11-23T11:11:28-0800,"The biggest deal for this is most of the Pokemon I use are not good in Gen 6 because of the lack of good move tutors. I also work and go to school full time AND I'm working on a movie that will keep me busy for 3+ years. I do not have the time to breed and train new Pokemon. This also makes the Pokemon Bank software worth absolutely worthless because nothing we bring over can't be used for anything official. They need to kill that rule with fire because its completely unfair for players who spent the time, energy and/or money to play someone to train Pokemon."
2013-11-23T11:11:44-0800,"I feel your pain C_N_ and Vaporeon. I put a lot of work into some of my pokemon that I'd hoped I'd be able to use once pokebank was up and running as well. Unfortunately even though I don't like to do so, occasionally I have to play the devil's advocate. I guess it's like any of our (somewhat) yearly modified announcements for the trading card game. Sure, it nerfs all the effort experienced pokemon players have put in on their past teams, but it also gives a lot of new players the opportunity to be on the same playing field. I sincerely doubt anyone who has been playing since Blue and Red will be entirely happy with this announcement, but at least they have some resources to work with to stay somewhat competitive. TPCi more or less is counting on their continued playing .... whether they like the announcement or not. Let's face it, most of us here have been playing for years. We're probably not going to quit due to a newly introduced ripple. We'll just grumble a bit and carry on .... and find a way to do our best with what we have to work with. The bottom line is that all players will be on the same equal footing. It's not necessarily fun for all, but bottom line .... it's fair.Just so you know however, I have the pokerus, and have given it to a lot of Dittos that I've harvested from the Friend Safari - many of which have maxed out IV's. I'm willing to supply those to friends here on the gym as a service .... more or less free of charge. Just put in my friend code and pm me that you've done so. Give me your code as well, and we can find a time to trade whatever you like for them. If you can help me out, great, but that's not why I'm doing it. I'm only doing this as a favor to everyone here."
2013-11-23T11:26:36-0800,"This rule effectively ruins a lot of people because XY lacks what the past Gens had. With my current work load, I can't train my pokemon again. There are way too many of them to take on. I have no reason to continue to play pokemon competitively anymore. Its like they are trying to force out older players."
2013-11-23T14:19:54-0800,"It could be possible that a ""test run"" is being done to make certain that the new system works. When you transfer over, the system is (to my understanding) going to filter out cheated/hacked Pokémon. Things like level 9 Dialga's and the sort.When people ask for ""fair""- you will need to understand and accept the changes made to accomplish that goal of fairness across the board.Change is supposed to be good- and not everyone likes change. Understandable. But look at the changes being made and what is requested with in those changes that were made.You want to battle via wi-fi? You really want to lose to a hacked/cheated team? Would you like to see more wi-fi tournies with prizes?Sure- I am losing a great amount of past work on Pokies I breed for tournies. But after these changes- it outweighs the many times my own personal hard ork went down the drain to a hacked/cheated team.I agree with P_A - This change should have come a long time ago. But thee had to be enough support an demand for more fairness in the VGC scene.This is a victory to those who do not cheat/hack. All of you past work is not wasted- it made you a better competitive player all around.I have played since the Red/Blue days................ and have many a times defeated cheated/hacked teams all around.This is a change that has transferred the TCG's ""Spirit of the game"" aspect into our domain, our turf of knowing what we have all been striving forward with to make our efforts to not only build the best team with an undefeated strategy into a reward that is backed by TCPI. Nintendo, Gamefreak,and the over all VGC player base.Believe it or not- all of my Pokemon are not RNG'd on my W2 cart. That cart has many years of transfer/event/breed/ - you name it-- on there.I take pride in knowing all of my stuff is legit, and my histories and victories are proof that I have what it takes to be one among the best trainers and battles out there.Sure- I do not compete for trading in that for staffing- but- I can still hang with the best and know that at least the effort and changes are with the intentions for the better t the VGC.I have not liked many changes to what is allowed in the changing formats- but, I still pull through in one way shape form or another.You all are no alone, ad people such as myself are out there and willing to assist you fellow VG'rs out.Look at it this way:I like to help, because I know that if you have had my help- I know that in return you will give me a great battle. And if you make it to take 1st place in a tourney and I helped you- I can share in that victory a little.I am going to be some old man one day day who can look back and laugh at this change and complain some about more new changes-but those changes will not take the trainer away from me since the game brings me the type of gaming I enjoy.I simply will ""drudge through"" these changes like I have in the past- but knowing that more efforts are being done to keep me from being ripped off of a victory and my time is truly wasted-I will take this change in a heart beat because losing to a cheater who wasted my time is way worse then the format change at hand.Not being a suck-up when I say this- but thanks TCPI/Nintendo/Gamefreak for listening to the player base.

Lum can stop Dark Void, but you're better off with Trevenant then since it can recycle Lum thanks to Harvest and has a better variety of attacks."
2013-12-03T03:30:10-0800,"Ok, I understand FS which is ""Friend Safari"" since I use that a lot, but what's the meaning of ""HA""Whatever happened to writing posts so everyone can read and understand them? It's almost like you're writing in code. You may have a helpful post but I can't thank you for it if I don't understand it."
2013-12-03T07:03:14-0800,"HA stands for Hidden Ability, like Blaziken's speed boost.I haven't really done breeding with Pumpkaboo yet, does the baby depend on the parent, and if so can't you breed it with an Extra Large to get an Extra Large with Insomnia?"
2013-12-03T08:40:43-0800,"That's correct. Ball, Ability (60%), and Size are all inherited from the mother. The only time the size is inherited from the father is when you're breeding with Ditto."
2013-12-03T10:55:16-0800,"Guess that means Extra Large is stuck with Frisk then, tis a shame really.BTW what do you mean by ball?"
2013-12-03T11:38:55-0800,"The Pokeball the parent is caught in. So say you catch a female Pumpkaboo in a Dusk Ball, its offspring will all be in Dusk Balls as opposed to a plain old Pokeball."
2013-12-03T11:51:26-0800,I thought he was referring to some other mechanic or some reason.
2013-12-05T10:04:47-0800,"You only get one mega per battle...plus all the megas except Absol and Banette are even MORE vulnerable to DV than everything else since they can't hold Lum or Chesto, they just get slept for free. Not sure what game you're even talking about there.A large about of doubles-viable Pokemon sit at 70 base speed so Smeargle is actually annoyingly fast by comparison, plus unless you're 88 base speed or over you have to run a +speed nature to outrun it, which a lot of Pokemon (Gardevoir, Toxicroak) don't particularly want to be doing. This also includes having to run +Speed on scarf sets and wind up losing power against everything else in the game just to not get slept by scarf Smeargle.Also Moody is really awful to have to fight on top of Dark Void and makes a bunch of classic anti-Smeargle strats not guaranteed. Simply outspeeding it doesn't work if it gets +2 Speed, praying for a miss is out the window once it gets +2 accuracy, and absorbing Dark Void with Lum or Chesto and KOing it will fail 40% of the time if it gets +2 evasion. Unless you're using Lum/Prankster + Safeguard or terrain or Slurpuff or something Smeargle can always find a way to give you crap if it gets good rolls."
2013-12-06T13:45:43-0800,^ Absol's Magic Bounce ability will reflect DV- therefore not a problem and thus why I do not think Smeargle is a big threat in that case.
2013-12-06T13:51:49-0800,"That is true but do you run MB Absol on your team and pokemon with Lum/ abilities to prevent sleep? Not everyone will do this but a move that auto sleeps half a team should be banned. Like Sixonesix said, anyone who wants to do this will make a team that can abuse it."
2013-12-06T14:00:30-0800,"Well, not looking to debate or continue to toss out strategies for countering DV- but- if TCPI didn't think that it was that game broken they would have banned it.Looks as if the attempt to get people to break away from the over used and the common team builds will sub come to the threat of DV then..............As far as ""What game are you playing?"" in regards to the new format- I never play the common meta as it is, so, my skills are what my main weapon is--"
2013-12-08T16:50:50-0800,"Not all players run a counter for TR either, but it's not banned either. There's plenty of ways to get around Smeargle DV, you can hit it twice in one turn to KO it (not hard with moves like Surf and EQ) or you can run Lum berry or Insomnia, you could even run Sleep Talk. There's plenty of ways around it."
2013-11-25T18:02:40-0800,"Yeah, who knows, maybe by the time US Nats rolls around they may have already changed some rules. Maybe Dark void will go back in the void."
2013-11-25T20:08:32-0800,I highly doubt that Dark Void is going to be such a game breaker attack like it has been in the past.Dark Void is nothing to concern yourself with being able to have 6 Mega Pokémon in your party.Dark Void may have been an issue for past formats- but your going to be staring down a whole new double barrel semi-automatic sawed off shot gun with dual banana clips holding triple-ot buck rounds with the Mega Pokémon like Mawile.................. you ready to face that and the Lum berry combo?
2013-11-25T21:45:07-0800,The game is still hard hitting and double sleep will always cause problems.
2013-11-28T11:50:45-0800,"^ Mega Absol will eat Smeargle using Dark Void. Plus, many Pokémon out speed Smeargle as it is, unless you Scarf the Smeargle.Plenty of options out there to avoid the void- I still do not see how anyone can NOT prepare for a Dark Void in their team--heck- you see a Smeargle on the opposing team- auto assume a DV and bring a Lum Berry in and cripple Smeargle if you are that ""fearing"" of a Smeargle.All I got to answer to the issue....................."
2013-11-28T12:25:36-0800,I always assume they carry DV. Its why I run safeguard on my moltres for doubles but because options exist does not mean some things need to be banned. The idea is to not force people to run fast pokemon to stop one thing.
2013-11-28T13:26:48-0800,"Smeargle has a Base 75 Speed, which is pretty much the worst possible speed possible. It's too slow to outrun pretty much anything competitive, and to fast for TR. Plus its defenses are shallow enough that a priority move should be able to decimate it normally, and one should always have a Priority move handy anyway, so I don't really see how its THAT threatening."
2013-12-02T01:15:27-0800,"The main trouble with Smeargle (at least from a casual team standpoint) is that most will likely run around with Focus Sash, so unless you double target it, target+spread move, or have a multi-hit move, it will likely get off a Dark Void; add in that a Follow Me/Rage Powder user can attract any initial attacks and KOing one on sight isn't always possible.But that being said, again the format is a lot different now. Some Pokemon have access to Prankster Safeguard, Safeguard itself isn't a one-use TM oddity and is available to a lot more Pokemon, Insomnia users, and of course just defeating it with good old Lum/Chesto. Sleep itself only lasts 3 turns max and sleep counters don't reset if you swap out. So it's definitely more manageable in a nerfed form, though overall it's still pretty disruptive if you don't plan your team properly in the first place to handle whatever could be thrown at it."
2013-12-02T18:20:31-0800,Gourgiest- another Pokémon that will destroy Smeargle. -- Interesting thing about this Ghost/Grass Pokémon is that it learns Fire type attacks.I still do not understand how Smeargle is going to be such a big threat this format...........
2013-12-02T19:21:35-0800,"Gourgiest has been looking pretty interesting to me. The biggest version has low enough speed to take advantage of Trick Room, and a sizable attack, not to mention it gets Phantom Force which can break through Protect."
2013-12-02T21:46:34-0800,"Just remember, Insomnia is its hidden ability. The only way to get a HA one is through FS. And all FS Pumpkaboo are average size, which is the lame size......yeah I already tried looking at it.

2013-10-19T06:32:20-0700,Well at least they're proactive. When I first got there I saved outside the pokecenter. Guess I got lucky.
2013-10-25T15:23:17-0700,"I never encountered this ""glitch"" but thank you, Nintendo, for your commitment to making the Pokemon games as enjoyable as possible!"

2013-10-09T19:11:35-0700,"So I was talking with my friend recently. We're both irritated whenever someone makes the claim Pokemon has run out of ideas. Just a few crappy designs for a gen mean nothing.My personal least favorite designs actually come from the first two gens. Grimer and Muk - it's a pile of poop that evolves into a bigger pile of poop. Digglett and Dugtrio - that's not an evolution, it's a party of Diggletts. And Unown. They did nothing to that except put eyes on the alphabet. Some of my favorite designs come from more recent games, such as the haunted tree Pokemon in 6th gen or Dusknoir from 4th gen.So my question is this:What is your least favorite Pokemon designs? What are your most favorite?Try to keep away from the obvious Ice Cream Cone discussion, go for something different. Also, a reminder, this discussion is on design alone, not relating to how well the Pokemon do in battle. Otherwise, I like Muk and Dugtrio in terms of battle. Just concentrating on design, what are your opinions?"
2013-10-13T10:29:19-0700,"I dunno, I always though Unown was a fun take on Pokemon design...now why they only gave it Hidden Power as its sole move, I don't know...You already mentioned one of my least favorite though, I never liked the Vanilluxe line, it even creeps me out a bit with the 2 headed stage 2 design. For this new generation, there's nothing outright I dislike, but Kefiki seems a bit lazy in design, I mean a key ring?"
2013-10-13T13:47:01-0700,The only design I dont like are Pokemon based on human made items. Its not natural.
2013-10-14T06:24:34-0700,I would have to disagree I like the pokemon based on human objects like rotom (You can argue that he is just in them and not them) and honedgeFor my least favorites all the regis and arceus
2013-10-14T14:45:28-0700,"The Regis (the 3 from Hoenn) aren't actually manmade. They were made by Regigigas. Not sure I follow about Arceus.Anyway, in my personal opinion, the designs i dislike are some of the new Fairy Pokemon (6th gen). They look too frilly for my taste. Slurpuff just makes me wanna kill it with fire. And i will say that a keyring pokemon is pretty unimaginative.Also Delphox, being a fox, is one that i honestly neither love nor hate. i love all foxes including fox pokemon but something about the design just makes me... i dont know. it was enough to make me choose Froakie over Fennekin. I admit, a bit shallow..."

2013-10-14T19:16:59-0700,"I never really liked pokemon based off of man made objects either, although I do think rotom is kinda cool. I agree with normal guy about that. But idk about arceus either. A god pokemon with a design of an alpaca."

2013-08-08T10:36:30-0700,The Shark. It has been jumped.For the love of everything good Pokemon has ever done please let this be fake...
2013-08-08T10:46:24-0700,I'm glad Ampharos finally decided to get a wig. That lack of hair thing was so unflattering.
2013-08-08T10:56:44-0700,"Well it's not fake.I'm still going to play the games, but my enthusiasm for this generation has just taken a massive nosedive."
2013-08-08T11:07:47-0700,I'm loving the designs but I'm HATING the whole Mega Evolution thing. It feels too Digimon-ish for my tastes. :\
2013-08-08T11:08:01-0700,"Lucario is so much win. It looks epic. Adaptability is so broken on Lucario, especially since Fighting is a strong type already plus Fairy-types might be weak to Steel. Fox_Master51 approves :thumb:Blaziken's color scheme is pretty cool. Not sure I like the design though. But at least Speed Boost will be more accessible.Absol looks cool i guess. Certainly more feminine. Magic Bounce is a good Ability. I like Mega Absol...Mega Mawile. All I have to say is ""woah"".Mega Mewtwo. Seen it. Could have a better Ability... Although it is the first Legendary to evolve.Mega Ampharos. It becomes a Dragon type at the worst time. And really Ampharos couldn't get an awesome design like the rest?It seems like they're trying to turn more Pokemon into pseudo Legendaries. If they make a Ninetales Megaevo they better not screw it up."
2013-08-08T11:28:28-0700,I don't like this mega Pokemon thing. They have a chance to fix the game. Please don't let them mess this up.
2013-08-08T11:32:44-0700,"I actually really like these for the most part. The designs are pretty cool (save for Ampharos, and kinda Absol), and I like the idea of pseudo ""Stage-3"" Pokemon.I'm also excited to see how this will be implemented into the TCG. I can totally see Lv. X's making a comeback, it seems perfect for these guys."
2013-08-08T11:37:18-0700,"but vaporeon, don't you want a Mega ex Pokemon with 300 HP and attacks that do 200 damage for 1 energy? Did I mention that they also just come out of your deck immediately as your opening basic? And have abilities that let you discard your hand and draw as many times as you want?"
2013-08-08T11:47:04-0700,"So these guys are probably the new ""EX/Level X/ex"" of the XY TCG series. Wonder how they will implemented?"
2013-08-08T13:01:48-0700,Just remember that Mega Digimon weren't the last stage of Digivolution. They could also DNA digivolve and fuse 2 digimon together. Cant wait for MegaBlaziken and MegaMetagross DNA digivolve into MegaMetaBlaziGrossIkenMon.
2013-08-08T13:08:56-0700,You'll probably have to sacrifice 3 Mewtwo's before you can summon your Mega Mewtwo. Unless your opponent plays a defusion trap card. All very original from Nintendo :nonono:
2013-08-08T14:18:43-0700,"Oh man, they used the word Mega, it must be a digimon ripoff! </this_thread>"
2013-08-08T14:29:16-0700,I totally agree with this. This could be a really neat way to rebalance and spice up the series (since a common complaint has been that the battle system hasn't changed enough). I could kind of see it as being the equivalent of the special attacks in RPGs (ie. Limits in FF7) only obviously being handled differently since by the looks of things they'll probably be temporary.Also am I the only one who gets reminded of Iris's design in BW2 when I look at Mega Mawile?
2013-08-08T14:32:14-0700,"If this is a temporary transformation thing, I don't like it. It's the sort of thing where, if it has any meaningful impact, it's going to be the main point of battles. There are a couple of other ways it could go though (hopefully). It could be a permanent thing (possibly reversible, possibly not), where the new ""Mega"" pokémon is different, but about as powerful, similar to how Formes work for some of those who have them now (e.g. the Therians). It could be a mechanic meant for a completely new type of battle - not like triple battles were, more like giant battles in the Mario & Luigi series were. Maybe something similar to Conquest or Rumble. It could be exactly what I fear it is, or any of the above, except it's an in-game thing only. Just like Latios and Latias are banned when they're holding Soul Dew but allowed without, they could let you unleash your Mega Blaziken on the Elite 4, but not let you bring it out against others.Either way I hate the name. ""Mega"" doesn't mean big or strong, it means million. A ""megablaziken"" sounds like a joke way to measure the heat of a star (""Wow, how warm is that?"" ""Four megablazikens.""), not a pokémon.I do like the designs so far though."
2013-08-08T14:32:27-0700,"what make pokemon different is thats its not degimon. Pokemon are suppose to be organic creatures that evolve or just exist. Digimon are just data and can change themselves when they need to. If they are making pokemon do this just because, then it means pokemon is becoming digimon. Also this sounds like power creep will be at its worst in this game."
2013-08-08T14:36:17-0700,People dislike this?These Pokemon look absolutely amazing! I'm so stoked for this already. MegaMawile is the best thing ever.
2013-08-08T15:24:10-0700,They should totally make a Pokemon and call it Tron.
2013-08-08T15:50:56-0700,"I really, REALLY doubt they will be called ""Mega"" in the English localization. It probably sounds just fine in Japanese, but not in English. I expect something different, although I'm blanking on potential alternatives."
2013-08-08T16:11:40-0700,"DNA Digivolved guys were still ""Mega"" level. They were just a stronger ""Mega"" than the un-DNA'd ""Mega""s. Remember that even at ""Mega"" level, some Digimon were still stronger or weaker than others. And the ""Ultimate"" MagnaAngemon was stronger than several ""Mega""s they came across."
2013-08-08T17:02:43-0700,"This. Exactly this. I like Digimon because the multiple branched evolutions makes sense for. Not so much for Pokémon, which I see as more.I've never been fan of Pokémon formes because they are reversible. I probably won't like these because they are both reversible and are just a generic prefix for the creatures with this Mega Evolution mechanic.I really like the designs though. Mega Blaziken and Mega Lucario look sick!Rumor has it that they will be referred to as Awakened? I can stomach that much better than Mega. Sort of like awakening their ultimate potential/power/whatever."
2013-08-08T17:19:10-0700,http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mega?s=tYOU WERE SAYING?
2013-08-08T22:29:16-0700,"I'd have liked this more if it was only Pokemon that weren't that good to begin with (Mawile was a good choice, for instance) got them, given it would give the chance for Pokemon like Beedrill that don't have a chance to become useful through a new evolution or ability to get a stronger form. Pokemon like Lucario and Blaziken getting these cheapens that a little IMO. (Though I like how Mega-Mewtwo seems to be specifically designed as a Darkrai counter, lol.)As for the comparisons to Digimon... How is this any different to forme differences? They're freely changeable, too! And the ability for those Pokemon to change forme has almost always only occured in games after their debut. This actually seems more logical to me than most forme changes. A sudden burst of power makes them change their form... But they can't sustain that power, so it's only temporary. It's not like certain kinds of energy couldn't make Pokemon change in shape and power anyway. (Evolution stones come to mind.) It being temporary doesn't make a difference to me.From a balance standpoint, we still know next to nothing. Though we do know one thing: You will have to basically sacrifice holding an item for the ability to use a Mega. ;p I don't think they will break anything."
2013-08-08T23:30:37-0700,"...something incorrect, apparently.Still don't like the name"
2013-08-09T00:04:21-0700,"So according to clarified information, it looks like these forms only show up in battles, and are temporary even within a battle. In other words, it's basically an item-induced super form that works only for a relatively short time in battle.Even if I've misinterpreted the info a bit, one thing is for sure: These forms are temporary and only happen in battles."
2013-08-09T01:03:03-0700,"These shouldn't be a problem, unless they decide to make a couple of broken ones... I could totally see them going overboard on a Mega Rampardos or something."
2013-08-09T01:58:23-0700,"I love all the designs, especially Lucario's and Blaziken's. I do enjoy how they gave Absol an angel wing.Adaptability Lucario will be amazing."
2013-08-09T10:10:11-0700,"I think this evolve during battle thing could just be another general evolution method. Like how certain Pokemon need a certain move or can only evolve at night. In this case, it seems like you have to bring the Mega Stone into battle and then it Mega Evolves. I don't see much evidence saying that it's temporary. So I'm hanging back on this and waiting for more info."
2013-08-09T10:39:33-0700,"Re-read your own statement for an answer. If you have to make a point that adifferencedoesn't make adifferenceto you... you're not being honest about the situation.You also started with an assumption, and that assumption was not a wise one to make; what about those of us who don't care for ""formes""? Or that don't mind them or like them, but dislike ones that are easily reversed? I am neither for nor opposed to ""formes"", but I want them to make sense both from a gameplay and from a setting perspective.Now consider how this also very much is copying one of Pokémon's major rivals (Digimon) due in part with how it is implemented and definitely with how it is named. Finally, consider that those of us dissatisfied with the combat mechanics in Pokémon... aren't going to have this solve anything. This is the same old thing with a new gimmick added on - it won't advance combat in and of itself, it won't balance out old issues, and the best they can hope for isnotcreating new problems."
2013-08-09T15:00:03-0700,"This is pretty interesting, since these Mega forms can only be used during battle... and require the use of a hold item. So Mega pokemon cannot have Choice items, Life Orb, Leftovers, et al.So it's a choice between a hold item and a Mega form.Nothing's original. Quit parroting this crap. It's not copying digimon any more than it's copying any one of a zillion other things where beings of some sort become bigger/flashier when they get stronger. For example I can easily say that both Digimon and Pokemon are heavily ripping off Dragonball Z using the same exact argument."
2013-08-09T15:04:03-0700,"I just noticed that in the new trailer, whenever a pokémon goes Mega, the rainbow double-helix-like symbol from the game logos appears above its head. So I suppose that explains that symbol."
2013-08-09T19:01:06-0700,"Re: implementation. We've had Pokemon who change forms, even mid-battle, since 2002. This is nothing new.Re: name. Mega Pokemon are known as Mega Pokemon even in Japan. Mega level Digimon are known as Ultimate Digimon in Japanese. Very doubtful that it was an intentional copying rather than picking an overusing word."
2013-08-09T19:23:31-0700,Who would ever think putting Mega at the beginning of a name would be a good idea?
2013-08-09T19:38:37-0700,The power rangers
2013-08-10T01:04:30-0700,"I look at it as sort of a temporary ""boost""- like super sane (or what ever the dragonball z reference is)-the Pokémon could return to normal after the battle...............Still- evolving just was not enough for certain Pokémon, like Absol. (I so dig Absol from the start it came around)-What would you rather have: Pre-evolution babies, or some sort of ""Huh, how do you get that thing to evolve into that?""seriously, mega, epic, up-grade, super-sane, this only opens the door to more options- not a gimic as far as strategy goes in the VG scene.Some Pokémon change forms in battles, some gain a boost in weather, hold items do certain things to benefit- this is sort of coolio in that it brings in some effort of change.like it or hate it- change happens and it is free will to enjoy or complain."
2013-08-10T05:45:53-0700,"A certain other Pokemon fan site found some info on Mega Evos posted on the JP X and Y site- I guess it states that basically you can only have one Mega in battle at a time, whether that means on your team period (aka no duplicate hold items clause- since the stones are all classified as the same type of item) or just active in the battle remains to be clarified.If this is true, at least they are balancing it (which I was hoping for) so we wont see people spamming a team of 6 Mega mons in battles or anything."
2013-08-10T07:00:25-0700,I agree with all you're saying. Just wanted to let you know that Goku is a Saiyan(or Saiya-jin in Japan I guess)
2013-08-10T07:21:58-0700,"I make no claims that anything is ""truly original"", but that doesn't mean that altering your game's mechanics to more closely resemble a franchise that has long rivaled you (or at least attempted to rival you) isn't noticeable. It is important to realize that life isn't always about absolutes; you can be disappointed when Product A copies Product B, especially when you prefer Product A due to its (now decreasing) differences with Product B. It isn't an ""all or nothing"" scenario, just like it isn't hypocritical to hold a standard you have failed to perfectly adhere to or even struggle to approach.My comment wasn't ""crap"" and I wasn't parroting it. It is the combination of my personal preferences and my analysis, and I even took the time to explain it (...it wasn't complicated). I am unimpressed by this mechanic, I find it unlikely to add to the game, I find it likely to detract from game balance, there is no sign that the issues I have with game play are going to be addressed... and then there is the impression that this is making the series even more like another that I don't enjoy anywhere near as much.If anyone is parroting, it is you; the complaint you make is pretty formulaic, and your reasoning faulty. Your broad categorization for both parroting and for what constitutes copying don't hold up to scrutiny. For example, you're repeating a phrase/complaint (parroting) that is recognizable, and thus you are parroting others to criticize me for ""parroting"".As finding something truly original is difficult (arguably impossible), from context it should be clear that there is a difference between complaining about two similar products becoming even closer versus two products that may fight for market share but aren't targeting the exact same audience using nearly identical concepts. Unless I missed the part where Master Roshi wanders the world to amass a stable of fighters to battle against other sensei doing the same thing? :lol:With such loose guidelines, we could accuse Pokémon (and Dragon Ball Z and all the other series with this concept) of having ripped off the Bible (again); look up ""The Transfiguration"" if you are unfamiliar with it. Not even the oldest example of the concept but the oldest I could come up with off the top of my head. So yes, there is a difference between concerns over two similar products becoming even more similar than between different products becoming similar.TL;DR:Parroting complaints about parroting may not be the best approach to discourage others from parroting arguments you don't like, though as I wasn't even parroting an argument it was a distraction anyway."
2013-08-10T12:17:04-0700,Mega Kanga announced at worlds too.Wish they actually did more with the base Pokemon but it's interesting to see the little tyke grown up
2013-08-10T12:47:26-0700,"I saw that from JWittz and Serebii. He's one of my all time fave pokemon, so that's great to see :thumb:"
2013-08-10T17:39:32-0700,"So what you're saying is that you don't actually have a counter-argument at all? Gotcha.small edit: also, if someone makes a statement about originality being irrelevant, it's usually not very effective to base your counter-argument on them being unoriginal themselvesAlso,so, as I said, the tripe about OMGZ THEY IS COPY DIGIMANS!!!! is unfounded and."
2013-08-11T09:01:16-0700,"No, what I said was you don't have a counter argument... and your follow up seems to support this (""seems to"" as I am in no way an objective 3rd party right now). Especially the edit; if originality doesn't exist, then complaining someone is unoriginal is at best self-indulgent but pointless and at worst an offense in and of itself. On the other hand, pointing out that the person (that would be you in this case) who isa) complaining about unoriginalityb) in an unoriginal wayc) while claiming there is no such thing as originalityis valid; this is because we aren't concerned with ""originality"" but hypocrisy. It also was one small part of the discussion; ignoring the rest says much.Not if you actually take in what is being said. If I create a video game about a robot that looks like a human boy, fights using an ""ultra tech"" arm cannon, and can copy (or at least approximate) an ability from some of the ""boss enemies"" he defeats and call it ""Mega Guy""... pretty sure it is still copying the formula of Mega Man even though the character is ""Rockman"" in Japan.Even if my character is not a robot but a golem, his weapons and enemies are magical instead of ultra tech... still copying. Pokémon and Digimon have differences, but they also have a lot of similarities - even without the name ""Mega"" this mechanic increases those similarities (though by no means makes them identical). The fact that ""Mega"" is being used despite being used by long-time rival (or even wannabe rival, given the difference in success) for anything pertaining to a Pokémon's form changing really feels like someone didn't do enough research or that it was intentional."
2013-08-11T14:08:17-0700,"I wonder if they will choose one Starter from each generation. If so, I'd love to see Mega-Meganium!"
2013-08-12T10:59:16-0700,"Good question! I may not want this new mechanic, but as I can't change it I can try to enjoy it for what it is. Not sure how they should ""restrict"" Pokémon that get the ""Mega"" treatment, but if one of the criteria is they want one of each starter, I think it would make sense to select the least competitive of each group....I would appreciate it if someone who knows which ones those are would fill me in. :lol:"
2013-08-12T11:51:22-0700,"If they are going to go with mega evolutions, then they need to give them to Pokemon who really need them and not pokemon who can already hold their own. Im not sure why creatures continue to make boost to good pokemon already but leave the ones people want to use behind."
2013-08-12T15:00:53-0700,"Mawile, Kanga, AMphy and to a smaller extent Absol are all Pokemon who really appreciate the treatment. Mewtwo is one of the most iconic Pokemon and it makes sense that it would recieve a new treatment as well to spearhead the hype. Blazekin and Lucario are kind of strange choices but Lucario isnt too over the top. I don't see the problem with the selection as it is, but i do agree with the sentiment that i hope they make things like MegaBeedril and MegaDunsparce before MegaGenesect and MegaTerrakion."
2013-08-12T16:05:13-0700,"hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm- seems to me that this time the tables have been turned a little when comparing the TCG to the VG-TCG had ""Level X"" and the what not- when the VG had nothing to mimic that aspect since the TCG is founded from the VG-so- this new ""Mega"" mode (for my own sake, just going to stick with MM) is IMO influential in a reverse manner to tie in the two products better.Just a thought by observation in the unity the two share.As far as the ""Digimon"" remarks- what has been around longer: Pokémon or Digimon? Or even as far as TCG's (Minus MTG, so do not think I do not recognize variety with history) - Yu-gi-oh and Pokémon?I am not the type to complain too much when I find similarities among things, especially in Pokémon compared to other things- but there is a line where similarities can be found- mimicked or original and that line is personal preference.Personal preference is a tough thing to satisfy, and there are options to NOT have a MM Pokémon in your party if you so choose.Flexibility in personal preference, while adding in new, the normal, the expected, and the similar. If you can find at least 80% enjoyment in a franchise- then the franchise is doing something correct which is better then most of the franchises out there."
2013-08-12T17:06:46-0700,"While that may be true, Amphy and Absol can hold their own as their stats allow them to. Amphy is really bulky and had decent attack stats and Absol has a really poweful ability along with great attack stats. Something Like Beedril or Pidgeot suffer from their stats when put against other Pokemon in their same class. They cant do much damage or are not very useful unless the perfect situation is at hand. Dunsparce is only good when it can attack a paralyzed Pokemon and hope for hax.If anything, Pokemon who cant do much in battle should get some kind if buff. I was really hoping for base stats to be re-balanced but with the addition of megas, I dont think that will happen."
2013-08-12T19:51:22-0700,"Simply put I wasn't complaining about you being unoriginal, I was complaining about yourepeating a stupid complaint.Which it is."
2013-08-13T06:08:42-0700,"At this point I am not concerned about how you labeled my comment... you're not really getting your point across too well, possibly because you're quoting the wrong people: those where the ""Digimon kind of does this already"" comments are theleastimportant part of the argument (or for some, might be apositive:lol.As stated, I don't care for the ""Mega"" mechanic because it feels like a needless gimmick being tacked onto an alreadybloatedcombat system. There are too many things that might be good ideas if the system was designed to incorporate them wholly, instead of ""duct-taping"" them on. When Pokémon was on the original Game Boy, the combat system was largely justified because... it was on the Game Boy; limits of the technology and game design of the time. It is no longer 1996, but 2013. The games didn't debut in the U.S. until 1998, so it has only been about 15 years, but as far as I am concerned, that is long enough."
2013-08-13T10:41:40-0700,"well, you said it. :|"
2013-08-14T14:43:49-0700,"Yes I did. To give an idea, though I'll quote the whole post that sentence came from, using red font for everything you didn't quote.Note:The ""you"" referred to in that post was rivershock.Tagrineth, what you quote didn't get mentioned until thethird paragraph(though congratulations on reading that far into one of my posts). The post was 184 words or 1000 characters (including spaces) according to Microsoft Word; the part you focused on was 30 words or 164 characters (including spaces); about a sixth the of the overall post.Yes, it is a point I made, but it wasn't the entirety of what I said. Remember this little back-and-forth was due to accusations that I was just ""parroting"" something; you can still try to accuse me of that, but1) As I am giving reasons and adjusting to the flow of the discussion, apparently I am copying from someone else in a similar debate or being fed information from a third-party. :lol:2) Me ""parroting"" someone else (which I am not) would not invalidate any of the actual discussion about the Mega mechanic; there merit is not derived from being original."

2013-08-16T23:19:49-0700,But what of that mysterious footage that looked 3d?Will it be a Wii U game?
2013-08-16T23:32:19-0700,"^Mystery? It is no ""mystery""- it's a teaser full of wonder....And that is how the Wii U sells a million+ units in this up-coming holiday season.........Pokémon XD2!"
2013-08-17T11:39:59-0700,Whats this about a pokemon wii u game? Link please.EDITI saw it. I would like to know more. Lucario got a battle pose update. I hope its the same for each Pokemon.
2013-08-17T12:54:59-0700,"It'd be about time for a new console game to show up, hasn't been anything since...PBR? Kinda sad as there was no console pairing for BW at all, so it's missed an entire generation now."
2013-08-17T14:43:34-0700,"^ Considering that XD:GoD had more then one gen in it featured- it would sort of make sense to invest into a solid console system (even into a newer system to promote sales in strategic implement of specific franchise mascots for support) - that Nintendo does wait some time to give ""more"" into a game then just relying on only one gen since the Pokémon series has grown. It would make for a better game over all if it included a wider range of variety while focusing on the newest expansion.From a self opinion and a business strategy observation: 4th-6th Gen would make for a great XD:GoD2 for the Wii U, since Snap 2, Saph/Em/Rby remakes are elusive in design (at this time) that a system core game is created for the Wii U for Pokémon to make it to the big screen. Personally (competitive side speaking here)- it would be awesome to see a Wii U Stadium game that features an all Gen roster.So- mystery screenshot speculation: Pokémon Stadium Elite (elite is my own there) or XD 2.Now, if I wish hard enough- beg and write/send in a million request letters, a million e-mails, create a FB page to generate a world wide effort for ""likes"" to support the games creation- and either of the two games happen: my mind will short out from excitement."
2013-08-18T01:16:01-0700,Has anyone seen stage 1 &2 final evolutions of x & y starters
2013-08-18T10:07:11-0700,"^ Not yet. Perhaps they do not want to reveal another fire/fighting type starter juuuuuuuuuuuuust yet,Nah, more then likely they will keep it under lock and key this time around, or wait until the last minute to reveal them in order to keep some of the suspense strong until the games release."
2013-08-19T18:36:28-0700,I think they are going to look Naruto-ish.Fennekin - Naruto w/ 8 tail powerFroakie - Jiraya w/ toad powerChespin - don't know yet
2013-08-22T19:35:32-0700,"Pokémon has such a unique look to it- not so much in the anime ""form"" for the video games. Sort of like Toon Link vs 3d Link. (I forgot the name of that recent Pokémon game that was anime'ish), but I do not think the VG's will go in that direction of being anime."
2013-08-22T22:30:27-0700,I think you mean Pokemon Conquest. Personally the best in the series.
2013-08-23T21:28:50-0700,^ Correct. Sheesh............. I AM getting old...........Thank you!
2013-08-24T17:18:19-0700,This world-wide release is going to be crazy. Nobody is going to know much about the game before it releases and it makes me anxious about how the game will play.
2013-09-02T09:39:00-0700,"Yeah and you know what? All I said was that I was sick of the ""QQ they ocpying diggmanz"" idiocy being parroted. Nothing else. I didn't care about anything else you said that was unrelated to that specific statement, lol."
2013-09-02T09:47:28-0700,I find it surprising that there is still no word on communication between Black/White and X/Y with a little over a month until the game releases world-wide.
2013-09-10T15:34:40-0700,There has been.http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/strategy/But that page still doesn't mention how you can transfer Pokemon from B/W to X/Y without the Bank/Transporter (finally! a faster way to transfer). Might just have to wait and see.
2013-09-10T19:13:22-0700,^ More then Likely the Bank is going to be the main method of Transferring Pokémon over to X/Y.
2013-09-10T19:17:18-0700,"I'm not sure how I feel about the additional boxes. Yeah, it'll be great to be able to have a lot more Pokemon, not to mention easier transfers, but how much is this thing going to cost? According to the website, it'll only be good for a year, so what does that mean? If your year expires and you don't buy it again, do you lose all your Pokemon?"
2013-09-10T20:40:06-0700,"Not positive on the Bank- I am under the impression it is $5.00 a year. Not sure about the loss of Pokémon if you do not renew the annual fee. This is still a gray area where speculation is either in favor of or against until the whole system and the game interactions (in even among all 3 (Bank/Transfer/cartridge)) are up and running.There will be a free trial for the Transfer app (30 days-???), and a test run for the Bank and the system to integrate an anti hack/cheated Pokémon design.We will have to wait and see."

Maybe they'll be saved on the Internet, and you have to buy the program again to have access to them. Either way, I guess we'll find out."

2013-09-11T08:42:06-0700,"The only evolution that looks any decent to me is Froakie's evolution. Chespin's evolution looks like a pinata, and Fennekin's evolution is kind of boring looking in my opinion.And are we going to see dual-type attacks? MAYBE!"
2013-09-11T09:34:05-0700,"Mega Garchomp?!! Really? As if it weren't broken enough, they give it Sand Force? For the love of... Gah! (For some reason, it reminds me of the anime Gurren Lagann 0_o)Mega Mewtwo, I honestly can't find anything to say about it...Chespin's evo is so dopey looking. Fennekin's evolution, even though I love foxes, looks... questionable. Froakie's evo looks cool I guess. Though now that I think about middle evos are never really what we expect.The blue cat Pokémon is pretty cool. I'm glad there will be more significant gender differences.That weird white, idk... poodle, thing. I don't get it.The Fossil Pokémon are okay (anybody else think of Chomper from Land Before Time?). The T-rex is cool and it gets an Iron Fist equivalent Ability. The blue Brachiosaurus looking one is a bit cutesy. But it's Ability is pretty neat, in that it changes Normal to Ice. Though Rock/Ice is an insanely horrible type combo.The Fairy-type chart spread seems pretty fair. It's interesting to say the least. I don't like how Steel loses resistances.All in all, it's an interesting update. though I pray for an epic final evo for Fennekin. Please for the love of all that's Pokémon >_<"
2013-09-11T16:22:32-0700,"I love all the new additions, some more than others. However I don't really care for the Megas but I wasn't a fan of Mewtwo (he really doesn't need 2 forms Dor Garchomp to begin with, so whatever."
2013-09-12T20:51:24-0700,Why did this get moved to VG discussion?It technically is gossip?
2013-09-12T21:41:18-0700,This is the VG game section on this news is VG related.
2013-09-13T07:20:47-0700,"Technically speaking I suppose.

2013-09-13T08:48:52-0700,"When Fairy type was first revealed -- VG areaWhen Fairy type was revealed for the TCG -- TCG areaSince all these new Pokemon are first appearing in the video game, it makes sense to me that the discussion should be taking place in the VG section.I'm loving Pyroar's two forms, and really like Tyrunt, but if it evolves, it will be that much awesome-r.Being able to customize how your character looks is awesome, and hopefully it will carry into Wifi battles, so we don't have to look like a trainer anymore."
2013-09-13T09:00:04-0700,"No worries, I was just a smidge confuzzled.Furfrou is my favourite!"
2013-09-13T09:36:44-0700,"Say, where did you find these names?"
2013-09-13T11:41:47-0700,On facebook pokemon posted a video.
2013-09-13T13:25:33-0700,"Furfrou is awesome. I hope that it's easy/inexpensive to change their style often. I'm tempted to assemble a stylish party of six Furfrou, all with different/complimentary cuts."
2013-09-13T14:32:06-0700,"It'd be awesome if you could ride Furfro around like you can Rhyhorn and stuff, and it'd show off your customization to it.I hope Tyrunt evolves and I can't wait to see what it evolves into. Tyrex maybe?"
2013-09-13T20:35:44-0700,"Pyroar's female has a little mane,"
2013-09-14T13:36:50-0700,"I am going to merge this thread with a similar thread, as it is all about new information on the X/Y games."
2013-09-19T07:36:33-0700,Aurorus + Tyrantrum were revealed!
2013-09-19T08:56:43-0700,I really like the look of the two dinosaur fossil Pokemon. Aerodactyl will blend in well with them.
2013-09-19T09:08:26-0700,"I'm wondering if there's going to be another new type revealed, besides Fairy. They were released in twos before. Then again, how much would it unbalance things? I feel like Dragon-types just got considerably less versatile, because now a Gardevoir (or Azurmarill/Blissey possibly?) can come out and potentially KO a Dragonite first turn. It will unbalance things even more if it's true that Dragon-type attacks won't affect Fairy-types (completely takes away the STAB advantage for single-type dragons like Haxorus). Mind you, this is from a more competitive prospective, so I suppose Fairys won't be as big a problem for most people."
2013-09-19T09:29:08-0700,"Well now you have to think, a lot of people are gonna gear their Dragons to counter Fairy. They're weak to Poison and Steel. Most Dragons can learn Steel type moves be it TM, Move Tutor, etc. and believe it or not some Dragons can learn Poison type moves. Though if you're anything like me, you'll probably just have another Pokemon that counters Fairy."
2013-09-19T09:46:36-0700,"Several things just gotconfirmed...1) XY Base Set will release on 2/5/14, just as I predicted.2) Kalos Starter Decks will release on 11/8/13. This is officially 2 days after Legendary Treasures releases in English.3) Kalos Starter Decks will contain Fairy Energy.4) There will be a ""Deluxe"" version of the Kalos Starter Decks that each contain a single BW-series booster pack."
2013-09-20T10:44:17-0700,"So therse Kalos starter decks, do they just come with a token XY starter and other random starter deck cards, or will they have the full Evos?"
2013-09-20T15:42:25-0700,Shouldn't this be discussed in the TCG area?

2013-09-25T08:59:23-0700,"Yet another unimaginative evolution. Admittedly though, it does look kinda cool. Coulda done better with the name..."
2013-09-25T10:33:19-0700,"Obviously it'd be Triedge. *high-five to anyone who gets that*I wouldn't really say it's unimaginative, not quite like Dugtrio and Magneton, but more akin to Metang.Most notable look at the sheath, on Honedge its has a rather elaborate design, but on Doublade the sheath while less elaborate keeps with Honedge's design making it appear as if the sheath has parted. For instance the black bottom of Honedge is still present as the center piece of Doublade and the symmetrical lines have merely separated from each other. It's a pretty cool evolution that expands upon it in a rather neat way in my opinion."
2013-09-25T12:13:01-0700,Preface: Sorry if this has already been discussedSo...I just read this about XY: The opening cinematic is in 3D. (Have to mention this since most of the game isn't in stereoscopic 3D.)Does this mean that MOST of the game is NOT in 3D? I was under the assumption that the WHOLE game is in 3D? Not just certain parts. Am I understanding that correctly?thanks!ken

2013-09-30T08:35:18-0700,"Rumors =/= Info leaks. Nothing in the last post is confirmed, and frankly I'd be surprised if they were.@keniselvis: Yes, most of the game is not in 3D. It was stated in an interview that putting 3D on the overworld would have meant they couldn't put as much detail into the world, so they opted for what they thought looked better."
2013-09-30T12:39:38-0700,So what does that mean? Does that mean that walking around is not in 3D but the battles are?Any ideas on where I could read that interview?My son says that pokemon rumble blast is ALL in 3D. Is that not pretty detailed?sidebar: I probably care a little too much because I picked up the pikachu 3DS in anticipation of XY. :^)
2013-09-30T15:47:51-0700,"3D would I guess depend on the environment of the area. Sort of like how in BW&BW2- the bridge is sort of 3D, the graphics are restricted to the change from 45 degree top/down view. The battles would be nice to see in 3D, and in a way I think it will still be nice to see some of the top/down views for like going into the Pokémon Center or other buildings.We'll just have to wait and see what is 3D toggled."
2013-09-30T15:50:18-0700,"Does it really matter if some things are in 3D and some aren't? it's a new Pokemon game. It'll look fantastic even without 3D. But if i had to guess, the overworld well probably have a less noticeable 3D effect than the battle sequences."
2013-09-30T18:23:07-0700,"Well, it OBVIOUSLY matters to me! :^)"
2013-10-02T07:40:43-0700,Mega Charizard XSpritzee and Swirlix preevos!
2013-10-02T08:54:06-0700,"So they finally decided to make him a Dragon. Fire/Dragon is actually a good type combo since Fire cancels out Dragon's Fairy weakness. From what is said, Tough Claws increases the power of physical moves; most likely a glorified version of Huge Power. Plus it's Attack goes up upon M.Evolving, meaning with Tough Claws and an Attack boost, Charizard becomes a physical powerhouse with moves like Flare Blitz and Dragon Claw or even Outrage. Of course, a Charizard with Drought is also very appealing...Also makes you wonder if Venusaur and Blastoise will have another M.Evolution."
2013-10-02T14:45:32-0700,"Something to keep in mind about the 3D thing is there are two things 3D can refer to: stereoscopic 3D, that's the 3DS's trademark accessed using the slider on the side, or just 3D models and backgrounds. Pretty much the entire game has 3D models, from what we've seen. They can be wonderfully detailed, and in my opinion they all look great. However. For every item you have on the screen, if you put it in stereoscopic 3D the system has to create it twice. So if every single blade of grass is drawn twice, and every single tree and stump is drawn twice, it takes a LOT of power from the 3DS. Particularly if they still wanted it to play at a high framerate for smooth animations. It would drain the battery like nothing else. Saving the stereoscopic 3D for areas with less things in it makes life simpler."
2013-10-02T17:45:03-0700,"Should I post something that is confirmed, but not officially released?I know the names of 2 new evos."
2013-10-02T19:03:08-0700,"Okay, this is making more sense! I hope you are right! Even in Black/White, so much of it is already in 3D modeling. i.e. the town that is in a circle is a great example of this.So what you are saying is that it might be all in 3D like pokemon rumble blast but then the special things (like fights, etc) those would be in the stereoscopic 3D. Am I understanding you correctly?"

2013-10-03T13:32:54-0700,Your link isn't working. But we all saw the typing coming with some dispute over Water and Grass's typing.
2013-10-03T15:37:00-0700,The link should work?Just let it load.I've found a ton of new guys!!!
2013-10-03T19:28:38-0700,"I only want to know how many new Pokemon there are. I am afraid of the rumored 70 new Pokemon. I'm sure its false, but still. I also want to know if there are new evolutions of old Pokes besides Eevee.Then again, I'm ok with waiting 9 more days."
2013-10-03T20:34:52-0700,"Oh god why? Why, Fennekin?! ;_; I had such high hopes. Only to be disappointed. The fluff in its ears are way too big, and shouldn't it have a staff or something? It's such a bad design and doesn't transition well from it's middle evo. Thanks for dashing my foxy hopes, Fennekin.*Sigh* Anyway, the other 2 are cool i guess.Chespin's final evo is definitely a stark change from Quilladin. It's like a rodent ogre or something.Froakie's final evo, Greninja or whatever, is probably, now, everyone's number one choice.Also, anybody else notice that Fennekin's evolution is the only one not weak to Fairy (Fighting and Dark are weak to Fairy). In fact Fennekin's lines resist Fairy."
2013-10-03T21:01:16-0700,"I will point out that it kind of looks like a shrine maiden or it's in a kimono, which is actually very fitting considering foxes in Japanese myth. I know a couple of my friends opinions on it changed when I pointed that out, so here's hoping that it helps you see the good. Personally I really enjoy the direction they took with it.Didn't notice the last bit, I did however notice that they have a double weakness thing going on. Fighting > Dark > Psychic > Fighting mirroring the original circle of weaknesses."
2013-10-03T23:34:50-0700,"I'm sorry, I just don't like its design. Whatever its based on, I just don't. I had too high hopes for it.Also to clarify, Chesnaught (Chespin's final evo) is Water/Fighting. It has a signature move, Spike Shield, which protects it from damage and hurts the attacker if physical contact is made.Greninja (Froakie's final) is Water/Dark. To add to its ninjaness, its signature is Water Shuriken. Also it has an insanely high Speed stat."
2013-10-04T03:06:53-0700,"That's fine, to each their own. Some people grow an appreciation for Pokemon when they notice stuff like that (myself for example), but not everyone does.Also lol minor flub, Chesnaught is Grass/Fighting, not Water/Fighting.Spike Shield is interesting, and I've heard that Water Shuriken is priority that hits multiple opponents, so I wonder what it's base power will be. Still waiting on Mystic Fire it seems though."

2013-10-04T12:06:00-0700,whoops how did i not notice that? lolzI hadn't heard that about Water Shuriken. So maybe it's like a weaker Priority version of Surf. Kinda misplaced on a Pokemon that's so fast.
2013-10-04T12:37:51-0700,"Some of the new Pokemon look nice. I'm looking forward to trying Talonflame (still a bad name). It nots going to replace my Moltres though. As for some, I really do not like it when Pokemon are designed after human made objects."
2013-10-04T14:03:59-0700,I agree on all counts. I love how some look all Halloween style. My Flying-type will probably be Charizard and/or Noivern. Klefki is such a misfire. A key ring Pokemon? Really? The mon I'm most trippin' on is Goomy and Sliggoo. These are perhaps the most non-dragon looking Dragon-type Pokemon ever.
2013-10-04T22:08:11-0700,"The new Ghost and Grass types stole my heart.Just throwing this out there, but when they are released in card form, I'll be making bulk trades just for them"
2013-10-04T23:35:09-0700,Personally: I don't care as much for looks- I care more about some variety for types. Bring on the GHOST/GRASS!
2013-10-05T00:57:56-0700,"Yeah, I'm glad to have another fire flying bird Pokemon."
2013-10-05T01:18:02-0700,It looks like the game did away with the movement grids. I'm glad for this.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSZtpxrXygUContain spoilers.
2013-10-05T01:25:08-0700,"(Didn't view the video as I'm trying to avoid spoilers at this point)If I recall, they stated a while ago that while you can move diagonally and what not the grid IS still present, as it makes cutscenes and the like easier to handle."
2013-10-06T13:19:57-0700,I know a ton!!! Anyone interested in possible megas or preevos PM me.
2013-10-06T14:28:17-0700,Just post here. This thread is about leaks and such. No need to keep it private.
2013-10-06T14:45:13-0700,"I believe this has everything revealed so far aside from the 3rd legendary, which I'll spoiler below:https://scontent-b-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/1383666_10101585124873932_1705537212_n.jpg........"
2013-10-06T21:05:27-0700,Here is a better revealing one.
2013-10-06T22:38:53-0700,"I'm more hyped personally now that everything's been spoiled, wish it were the 12th already...lucky Canada/Italy peeps that managed to get it.Either that or this is the most elaborate fake info ever and should be praised."
2013-10-07T06:25:17-0700,"Are those numbers confirmed? If so, the rumor of about only 70 new poke are true, but it's closer to 100 with the mega evolutions. Honestly, I'd praise the, on that. Quality over quantity for one, and for 2, there's reportedly a big emphasis on the older pokemon, so that also makes sense.Lastly, with so few new poke, it should make it easy to feature them ALL in the first few XY TCG sets."
2013-10-07T07:25:45-0700,"Personally, I think its a bunch of crap that they cant make at least 100 quality Pokemon. I hate that the diversity of new Pokemon is so low. 1 Bug line is a disgrace."
2013-10-07T07:58:01-0700,"You need to remember that fairy is a new type, so they need to introduce more of em."
2013-10-07T14:52:14-0700,"I kinda wanted to see more new type combos, too. Like Poison/Dragon or Ghost/Fairy or Electric/Fire. IDK some other new cool combos to switch things up."
2013-10-09T09:41:19-0700,Okay so there IS a Poison/Dragon type.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK3sUqDsT44
2013-10-09T20:26:08-0700,"Wow, surprisingly enough, there are no Ground pokemon in this generation except for the legendary pokemon that starts with Z, and the mega evolution of Garchomp! Believe me, that'll be the first thing I'll correct when I can migrate some of my pokemon from earlier games. edit: Mind you, there are only 3 electric pokemon (so they may not come in as handy as I first thought), but they can be useful for poison (which again, there aren't many - 2 in total), fire, rock and steel."
2013-10-09T21:47:24-0700,"Well, you'll have to wait till December 27 to do so... I just want to pet my Pidgeot I've been raising since 4th gen. Sucks we have to wait so long to transfer."
2013-10-09T22:10:38-0700,I wanna play with my Sceptile I've kept since 3rd Gen. Quite honestly my very first Pokemon
2013-10-10T03:26:53-0700,"Really? That long? Wow, that sucks. I'll have finished with the game long before then. I may not even be interested in playing it anymore by then."
2013-10-10T11:53:51-0700,I have no idea why we have to wait till the end of the year. I'm not liking any of the decisions TPC are making lately.

2013-10-13T11:33:21-0700,"Is there going to be a thread for X&Y post release discussion?Anyhow had a look at all the new pokemon and I must say there's not as many as there has been. While I would have liked for there to be evolutions of previously released pokemon, it's kinda been done with the Mega-Evolution mechanic. I'm surprised at the limited number of new Legendaries. At least we have more chances to get the older legendaries. Though it seems they've moved away from getting mystery gift items for them, which I didn't really mind. Since the third new legendary begins with a Z, it seems likely we will have one third game with that Pokemon as the star ala Crystal/Emerald/Platinum. I hated that they did 2 expansion games for the Black and White series. It also seems they are moving away from adding tons of new pokemon as a whole, which IMO is a good thing. I'd prefer that they stop adding a million new pokemon every generation. I wouldn't mind new regions with the same old pokemon. I dream of the day that all 700 or so pokemon are obtainable in games of one generation. Would be awesome if there was a game with all of the current main regions to do this."

2013-08-08T10:46:24-0700,I'm glad Ampharos finally decided to get a wig. That lack of hair thing was so unflattering.
2013-08-08T10:56:44-0700,"Well it's not fake.I'm still going to play the games, but my enthusiasm for this generation has just taken a massive nosedive."
2013-08-08T11:07:47-0700,I'm loving the designs but I'm HATING the whole Mega Evolution thing. It feels too Digimon-ish for my tastes. :\
2013-08-08T11:08:01-0700,"Lucario is so much win. It looks epic. Adaptability is so broken on Lucario, especially since Fighting is a strong type already plus Fairy-types might be weak to Steel. Fox_Master51 approves :thumb:Blaziken's color scheme is pretty cool. Not sure I like the design though. But at least Speed Boost will be more accessible.Absol looks cool i guess. Certainly more feminine. Magic Bounce is a good Ability. I like Mega Absol...Mega Mawile. All I have to say is ""woah"".Mega Mewtwo. Seen it. Could have a better Ability... Although it is the first Legendary to evolve.Mega Ampharos. It becomes a Dragon type at the worst time. And really Ampharos couldn't get an awesome design like the rest?It seems like they're trying to turn more Pokemon into pseudo Legendaries. If they make a Ninetales Megaevo they better not screw it up."
2013-08-08T11:28:28-0700,I don't like this mega Pokemon thing. They have a chance to fix the game. Please don't let them mess this up.
2013-08-08T11:32:44-0700,"I actually really like these for the most part. The designs are pretty cool (save for Ampharos, and kinda Absol), and I like the idea of pseudo ""Stage-3"" Pokemon.I'm also excited to see how this will be implemented into the TCG. I can totally see Lv. X's making a comeback, it seems perfect for these guys."
2013-08-08T11:37:18-0700,"but vaporeon, don't you want a Mega ex Pokemon with 300 HP and attacks that do 200 damage for 1 energy? Did I mention that they also just come out of your deck immediately as your opening basic? And have abilities that let you discard your hand and draw as many times as you want?"
2013-08-08T11:47:04-0700,"So these guys are probably the new ""EX/Level X/ex"" of the XY TCG series. Wonder how they will implemented?"
2013-08-08T13:01:48-0700,Just remember that Mega Digimon weren't the last stage of Digivolution. They could also DNA digivolve and fuse 2 digimon together. Cant wait for MegaBlaziken and MegaMetagross DNA digivolve into MegaMetaBlaziGrossIkenMon.
2013-08-08T13:08:56-0700,You'll probably have to sacrifice 3 Mewtwo's before you can summon your Mega Mewtwo. Unless your opponent plays a defusion trap card. All very original from Nintendo :nonono:
2013-08-08T14:18:43-0700,"Oh man, they used the word Mega, it must be a digimon ripoff! </this_thread>"
2013-08-08T14:29:16-0700,I totally agree with this. This could be a really neat way to rebalance and spice up the series (since a common complaint has been that the battle system hasn't changed enough). I could kind of see it as being the equivalent of the special attacks in RPGs (ie. Limits in FF7) only obviously being handled differently since by the looks of things they'll probably be temporary.Also am I the only one who gets reminded of Iris's design in BW2 when I look at Mega Mawile?
2013-08-08T14:32:14-0700,"If this is a temporary transformation thing, I don't like it. It's the sort of thing where, if it has any meaningful impact, it's going to be the main point of battles. There are a couple of other ways it could go though (hopefully). It could be a permanent thing (possibly reversible, possibly not), where the new ""Mega"" pokémon is different, but about as powerful, similar to how Formes work for some of those who have them now (e.g. the Therians). It could be a mechanic meant for a completely new type of battle - not like triple battles were, more like giant battles in the Mario & Luigi series were. Maybe something similar to Conquest or Rumble. It could be exactly what I fear it is, or any of the above, except it's an in-game thing only. Just like Latios and Latias are banned when they're holding Soul Dew but allowed without, they could let you unleash your Mega Blaziken on the Elite 4, but not let you bring it out against others.Either way I hate the name. ""Mega"" doesn't mean big or strong, it means million. A ""megablaziken"" sounds like a joke way to measure the heat of a star (""Wow, how warm is that?"" ""Four megablazikens.""), not a pokémon.I do like the designs so far though."
2013-08-08T14:32:27-0700,"what make pokemon different is thats its not degimon. Pokemon are suppose to be organic creatures that evolve or just exist. Digimon are just data and can change themselves when they need to. If they are making pokemon do this just because, then it means pokemon is becoming digimon. Also this sounds like power creep will be at its worst in this game."
2013-08-08T14:36:17-0700,People dislike this?These Pokemon look absolutely amazing! I'm so stoked for this already. MegaMawile is the best thing ever.
2013-08-08T15:24:10-0700,They should totally make a Pokemon and call it Tron.
2013-08-08T15:50:56-0700,"I really, REALLY doubt they will be called ""Mega"" in the English localization. It probably sounds just fine in Japanese, but not in English. I expect something different, although I'm blanking on potential alternatives."
2013-08-08T16:11:40-0700,"DNA Digivolved guys were still ""Mega"" level. They were just a stronger ""Mega"" than the un-DNA'd ""Mega""s. Remember that even at ""Mega"" level, some Digimon were still stronger or weaker than others. And the ""Ultimate"" MagnaAngemon was stronger than several ""Mega""s they came across."
2013-08-08T17:02:43-0700,"This. Exactly this. I like Digimon because the multiple branched evolutions makes sense for. Not so much for Pokémon, which I see as more.I've never been fan of Pokémon formes because they are reversible. I probably won't like these because they are both reversible and are just a generic prefix for the creatures with this Mega Evolution mechanic.I really like the designs though. Mega Blaziken and Mega Lucario look sick!Rumor has it that they will be referred to as Awakened? I can stomach that much better than Mega. Sort of like awakening their ultimate potential/power/whatever."
2013-08-08T17:19:10-0700,http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mega?s=tYOU WERE SAYING?
2013-08-08T22:29:16-0700,"I'd have liked this more if it was only Pokemon that weren't that good to begin with (Mawile was a good choice, for instance) got them, given it would give the chance for Pokemon like Beedrill that don't have a chance to become useful through a new evolution or ability to get a stronger form. Pokemon like Lucario and Blaziken getting these cheapens that a little IMO. (Though I like how Mega-Mewtwo seems to be specifically designed as a Darkrai counter, lol.)As for the comparisons to Digimon... How is this any different to forme differences? They're freely changeable, too! And the ability for those Pokemon to change forme has almost always only occured in games after their debut. This actually seems more logical to me than most forme changes. A sudden burst of power makes them change their form... But they can't sustain that power, so it's only temporary. It's not like certain kinds of energy couldn't make Pokemon change in shape and power anyway. (Evolution stones come to mind.) It being temporary doesn't make a difference to me.From a balance standpoint, we still know next to nothing. Though we do know one thing: You will have to basically sacrifice holding an item for the ability to use a Mega. ;p I don't think they will break anything."
2013-08-08T23:30:37-0700,"...something incorrect, apparently.Still don't like the name"
2013-08-09T00:04:21-0700,"So according to clarified information, it looks like these forms only show up in battles, and are temporary even within a battle. In other words, it's basically an item-induced super form that works only for a relatively short time in battle.Even if I've misinterpreted the info a bit, one thing is for sure: These forms are temporary and only happen in battles."
2013-08-09T01:03:03-0700,"These shouldn't be a problem, unless they decide to make a couple of broken ones... I could totally see them going overboard on a Mega Rampardos or something."
2013-08-09T01:58:23-0700,"I love all the designs, especially Lucario's and Blaziken's. I do enjoy how they gave Absol an angel wing.Adaptability Lucario will be amazing."
2013-08-09T10:10:11-0700,"I think this evolve during battle thing could just be another general evolution method. Like how certain Pokemon need a certain move or can only evolve at night. In this case, it seems like you have to bring the Mega Stone into battle and then it Mega Evolves. I don't see much evidence saying that it's temporary. So I'm hanging back on this and waiting for more info."
2013-08-09T10:39:33-0700,"Re-read your own statement for an answer. If you have to make a point that adifferencedoesn't make adifferenceto you... you're not being honest about the situation.You also started with an assumption, and that assumption was not a wise one to make; what about those of us who don't care for ""formes""? Or that don't mind them or like them, but dislike ones that are easily reversed? I am neither for nor opposed to ""formes"", but I want them to make sense both from a gameplay and from a setting perspective.Now consider how this also very much is copying one of Pokémon's major rivals (Digimon) due in part with how it is implemented and definitely with how it is named. Finally, consider that those of us dissatisfied with the combat mechanics in Pokémon... aren't going to have this solve anything. This is the same old thing with a new gimmick added on - it won't advance combat in and of itself, it won't balance out old issues, and the best they can hope for isnotcreating new problems."
2013-08-09T15:00:03-0700,"This is pretty interesting, since these Mega forms can only be used during battle... and require the use of a hold item. So Mega pokemon cannot have Choice items, Life Orb, Leftovers, et al.So it's a choice between a hold item and a Mega form.Nothing's original. Quit parroting this crap. It's not copying digimon any more than it's copying any one of a zillion other things where beings of some sort become bigger/flashier when they get stronger. For example I can easily say that both Digimon and Pokemon are heavily ripping off Dragonball Z using the same exact argument."
2013-08-09T15:04:03-0700,"I just noticed that in the new trailer, whenever a pokémon goes Mega, the rainbow double-helix-like symbol from the game logos appears above its head. So I suppose that explains that symbol."
2013-08-09T19:01:06-0700,"Re: implementation. We've had Pokemon who change forms, even mid-battle, since 2002. This is nothing new.Re: name. Mega Pokemon are known as Mega Pokemon even in Japan. Mega level Digimon are known as Ultimate Digimon in Japanese. Very doubtful that it was an intentional copying rather than picking an overusing word."
2013-08-09T19:23:31-0700,Who would ever think putting Mega at the beginning of a name would be a good idea?
2013-08-09T19:38:37-0700,The power rangers
2013-08-10T01:04:30-0700,"I look at it as sort of a temporary ""boost""- like super sane (or what ever the dragonball z reference is)-the Pokémon could return to normal after the battle...............Still- evolving just was not enough for certain Pokémon, like Absol. (I so dig Absol from the start it came around)-What would you rather have: Pre-evolution babies, or some sort of ""Huh, how do you get that thing to evolve into that?""seriously, mega, epic, up-grade, super-sane, this only opens the door to more options- not a gimic as far as strategy goes in the VG scene.Some Pokémon change forms in battles, some gain a boost in weather, hold items do certain things to benefit- this is sort of coolio in that it brings in some effort of change.like it or hate it- change happens and it is free will to enjoy or complain."
2013-08-10T05:45:53-0700,"A certain other Pokemon fan site found some info on Mega Evos posted on the JP X and Y site- I guess it states that basically you can only have one Mega in battle at a time, whether that means on your team period (aka no duplicate hold items clause- since the stones are all classified as the same type of item) or just active in the battle remains to be clarified.If this is true, at least they are balancing it (which I was hoping for) so we wont see people spamming a team of 6 Mega mons in battles or anything."
2013-08-10T07:00:25-0700,I agree with all you're saying. Just wanted to let you know that Goku is a Saiyan(or Saiya-jin in Japan I guess)
2013-08-10T07:21:58-0700,"I make no claims that anything is ""truly original"", but that doesn't mean that altering your game's mechanics to more closely resemble a franchise that has long rivaled you (or at least attempted to rival you) isn't noticeable. It is important to realize that life isn't always about absolutes; you can be disappointed when Product A copies Product B, especially when you prefer Product A due to its (now decreasing) differences with Product B. It isn't an ""all or nothing"" scenario, just like it isn't hypocritical to hold a standard you have failed to perfectly adhere to or even struggle to approach.My comment wasn't ""crap"" and I wasn't parroting it. It is the combination of my personal preferences and my analysis, and I even took the time to explain it (...it wasn't complicated). I am unimpressed by this mechanic, I find it unlikely to add to the game, I find it likely to detract from game balance, there is no sign that the issues I have with game play are going to be addressed... and then there is the impression that this is making the series even more like another that I don't enjoy anywhere near as much.If anyone is parroting, it is you; the complaint you make is pretty formulaic, and your reasoning faulty. Your broad categorization for both parroting and for what constitutes copying don't hold up to scrutiny. For example, you're repeating a phrase/complaint (parroting) that is recognizable, and thus you are parroting others to criticize me for ""parroting"".As finding something truly original is difficult (arguably impossible), from context it should be clear that there is a difference between complaining about two similar products becoming even closer versus two products that may fight for market share but aren't targeting the exact same audience using nearly identical concepts. Unless I missed the part where Master Roshi wanders the world to amass a stable of fighters to battle against other sensei doing the same thing? :lol:With such loose guidelines, we could accuse Pokémon (and Dragon Ball Z and all the other series with this concept) of having ripped off the Bible (again); look up ""The Transfiguration"" if you are unfamiliar with it. Not even the oldest example of the concept but the oldest I could come up with off the top of my head. So yes, there is a difference between concerns over two similar products becoming even more similar than between different products becoming similar.TL;DR:Parroting complaints about parroting may not be the best approach to discourage others from parroting arguments you don't like, though as I wasn't even parroting an argument it was a distraction anyway."
2013-08-10T12:17:04-0700,Mega Kanga announced at worlds too.Wish they actually did more with the base Pokemon but it's interesting to see the little tyke grown up
2013-08-10T12:47:26-0700,"I saw that from JWittz and Serebii. He's one of my all time fave pokemon, so that's great to see :thumb:"
2013-08-10T17:39:32-0700,"So what you're saying is that you don't actually have a counter-argument at all? Gotcha.small edit: also, if someone makes a statement about originality being irrelevant, it's usually not very effective to base your counter-argument on them being unoriginal themselvesAlso,so, as I said, the tripe about OMGZ THEY IS COPY DIGIMANS!!!! is unfounded and."
2013-08-11T09:01:16-0700,"No, what I said was you don't have a counter argument... and your follow up seems to support this (""seems to"" as I am in no way an objective 3rd party right now). Especially the edit; if originality doesn't exist, then complaining someone is unoriginal is at best self-indulgent but pointless and at worst an offense in and of itself. On the other hand, pointing out that the person (that would be you in this case) who isa) complaining about unoriginalityb) in an unoriginal wayc) while claiming there is no such thing as originalityis valid; this is because we aren't concerned with ""originality"" but hypocrisy. It also was one small part of the discussion; ignoring the rest says much.Not if you actually take in what is being said. If I create a video game about a robot that looks like a human boy, fights using an ""ultra tech"" arm cannon, and can copy (or at least approximate) an ability from some of the ""boss enemies"" he defeats and call it ""Mega Guy""... pretty sure it is still copying the formula of Mega Man even though the character is ""Rockman"" in Japan.Even if my character is not a robot but a golem, his weapons and enemies are magical instead of ultra tech... still copying. Pokémon and Digimon have differences, but they also have a lot of similarities - even without the name ""Mega"" this mechanic increases those similarities (though by no means makes them identical). The fact that ""Mega"" is being used despite being used by long-time rival (or even wannabe rival, given the difference in success) for anything pertaining to a Pokémon's form changing really feels like someone didn't do enough research or that it was intentional."
2013-08-11T14:08:17-0700,"I wonder if they will choose one Starter from each generation. If so, I'd love to see Mega-Meganium!"
2013-08-12T10:59:16-0700,"Good question! I may not want this new mechanic, but as I can't change it I can try to enjoy it for what it is. Not sure how they should ""restrict"" Pokémon that get the ""Mega"" treatment, but if one of the criteria is they want one of each starter, I think it would make sense to select the least competitive of each group....I would appreciate it if someone who knows which ones those are would fill me in. :lol:"
2013-08-12T11:51:22-0700,"If they are going to go with mega evolutions, then they need to give them to Pokemon who really need them and not pokemon who can already hold their own. Im not sure why creatures continue to make boost to good pokemon already but leave the ones people want to use behind."
2013-08-12T15:00:53-0700,"Mawile, Kanga, AMphy and to a smaller extent Absol are all Pokemon who really appreciate the treatment. Mewtwo is one of the most iconic Pokemon and it makes sense that it would recieve a new treatment as well to spearhead the hype. Blazekin and Lucario are kind of strange choices but Lucario isnt too over the top. I don't see the problem with the selection as it is, but i do agree with the sentiment that i hope they make things like MegaBeedril and MegaDunsparce before MegaGenesect and MegaTerrakion."
2013-08-12T16:05:13-0700,"hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm- seems to me that this time the tables have been turned a little when comparing the TCG to the VG-TCG had ""Level X"" and the what not- when the VG had nothing to mimic that aspect since the TCG is founded from the VG-so- this new ""Mega"" mode (for my own sake, just going to stick with MM) is IMO influential in a reverse manner to tie in the two products better.Just a thought by observation in the unity the two share.As far as the ""Digimon"" remarks- what has been around longer: Pokémon or Digimon? Or even as far as TCG's (Minus MTG, so do not think I do not recognize variety with history) - Yu-gi-oh and Pokémon?I am not the type to complain too much when I find similarities among things, especially in Pokémon compared to other things- but there is a line where similarities can be found- mimicked or original and that line is personal preference.Personal preference is a tough thing to satisfy, and there are options to NOT have a MM Pokémon in your party if you so choose.Flexibility in personal preference, while adding in new, the normal, the expected, and the similar. If you can find at least 80% enjoyment in a franchise- then the franchise is doing something correct which is better then most of the franchises out there."
2013-08-12T17:06:46-0700,"While that may be true, Amphy and Absol can hold their own as their stats allow them to. Amphy is really bulky and had decent attack stats and Absol has a really poweful ability along with great attack stats. Something Like Beedril or Pidgeot suffer from their stats when put against other Pokemon in their same class. They cant do much damage or are not very useful unless the perfect situation is at hand. Dunsparce is only good when it can attack a paralyzed Pokemon and hope for hax.If anything, Pokemon who cant do much in battle should get some kind if buff. I was really hoping for base stats to be re-balanced but with the addition of megas, I dont think that will happen."
2013-08-12T19:51:22-0700,"Simply put I wasn't complaining about you being unoriginal, I was complaining about yourepeating a stupid complaint.Which it is."
2013-08-13T06:08:42-0700,"At this point I am not concerned about how you labeled my comment... you're not really getting your point across too well, possibly because you're quoting the wrong people: those where the ""Digimon kind of does this already"" comments are theleastimportant part of the argument (or for some, might be apositive:lol.As stated, I don't care for the ""Mega"" mechanic because it feels like a needless gimmick being tacked onto an alreadybloatedcombat system. There are too many things that might be good ideas if the system was designed to incorporate them wholly, instead of ""duct-taping"" them on. When Pokémon was on the original Game Boy, the combat system was largely justified because... it was on the Game Boy; limits of the technology and game design of the time. It is no longer 1996, but 2013. The games didn't debut in the U.S. until 1998, so it has only been about 15 years, but as far as I am concerned, that is long enough."
2013-08-13T10:41:40-0700,"well, you said it. :|"
2013-08-14T14:43:49-0700,"Yes I did. To give an idea, though I'll quote the whole post that sentence came from, using red font for everything you didn't quote.Note:The ""you"" referred to in that post was rivershock.Tagrineth, what you quote didn't get mentioned until thethird paragraph(though congratulations on reading that far into one of my posts). The post was 184 words or 1000 characters (including spaces) according to Microsoft Word; the part you focused on was 30 words or 164 characters (including spaces); about a sixth the of the overall post.Yes, it is a point I made, but it wasn't the entirety of what I said. Remember this little back-and-forth was due to accusations that I was just ""parroting"" something; you can still try to accuse me of that, but1) As I am giving reasons and adjusting to the flow of the discussion, apparently I am copying from someone else in a similar debate or being fed information from a third-party. :lol:2) Me ""parroting"" someone else (which I am not) would not invalidate any of the actual discussion about the Mega mechanic; there merit is not derived from being original."

2013-08-17T12:54:59-0700,"It'd be about time for a new console game to show up, hasn't been anything since...PBR? Kinda sad as there was no console pairing for BW at all, so it's missed an entire generation now."
2013-08-17T14:43:34-0700,"^ Considering that XD:GoD had more then one gen in it featured- it would sort of make sense to invest into a solid console system (even into a newer system to promote sales in strategic implement of specific franchise mascots for support) - that Nintendo does wait some time to give ""more"" into a game then just relying on only one gen since the Pokémon series has grown. It would make for a better game over all if it included a wider range of variety while focusing on the newest expansion.From a self opinion and a business strategy observation: 4th-6th Gen would make for a great XD:GoD2 for the Wii U, since Snap 2, Saph/Em/Rby remakes are elusive in design (at this time) that a system core game is created for the Wii U for Pokémon to make it to the big screen. Personally (competitive side speaking here)- it would be awesome to see a Wii U Stadium game that features an all Gen roster.So- mystery screenshot speculation: Pokémon Stadium Elite (elite is my own there) or XD 2.Now, if I wish hard enough- beg and write/send in a million request letters, a million e-mails, create a FB page to generate a world wide effort for ""likes"" to support the games creation- and either of the two games happen: my mind will short out from excitement."

Perhaps they do not want to reveal another fire/fighting type starter juuuuuuuuuuuuust yet,Nah, more then likely they will keep it under lock and key this time around, or wait until the last minute to reveal them in order to keep some of the suspense strong until the games release."

2013-08-22T22:30:27-0700,I think you mean Pokemon Conquest. Personally the best in the series.
2013-08-23T21:28:50-0700,^ Correct. Sheesh............. I AM getting old...........Thank you!
2013-08-24T17:18:19-0700,This world-wide release is going to be crazy. Nobody is going to know much about the game before it releases and it makes me anxious about how the game will play.
2013-09-02T09:39:00-0700,"Yeah and you know what? All I said was that I was sick of the ""QQ they ocpying diggmanz"" idiocy being parroted. Nothing else. I didn't care about anything else you said that was unrelated to that specific statement, lol."
2013-09-02T09:47:28-0700,I find it surprising that there is still no word on communication between Black/White and X/Y with a little over a month until the game releases world-wide.
2013-09-10T15:34:40-0700,There has been.http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/strategy/But that page still doesn't mention how you can transfer Pokemon from B/W to X/Y without the Bank/Transporter (finally! a faster way to transfer). Might just have to wait and see.
2013-09-10T19:13:22-0700,^ More then Likely the Bank is going to be the main method of Transferring Pokémon over to X/Y.
2013-09-10T19:17:18-0700,"I'm not sure how I feel about the additional boxes. Yeah, it'll be great to be able to have a lot more Pokemon, not to mention easier transfers, but how much is this thing going to cost? According to the website, it'll only be good for a year, so what does that mean? If your year expires and you don't buy it again, do you lose all your Pokemon?"
2013-09-10T20:40:06-0700,"Not positive on the Bank- I am under the impression it is $5.00 a year. Not sure about the loss of Pokémon if you do not renew the annual fee. This is still a gray area where speculation is either in favor of or against until the whole system and the game interactions (in even among all 3 (Bank/Transfer/cartridge)) are up and running.There will be a free trial for the Transfer app (30 days-???), and a test run for the Bank and the system to integrate an anti hack/cheated Pokémon design.We will have to wait and see."
2013-09-10T20:43:04-0700,"I can't imagine Nintendo/Game Freak/whoever's in charge here would cause you to lose all your Pokemon stored online just because you didn't rebuy the program. Maybe they'll be saved on the Internet, and you have to buy the program again to have access to them. Either way, I guess we'll find out."

2013-09-11T08:42:06-0700,"The only evolution that looks any decent to me is Froakie's evolution. Chespin's evolution looks like a pinata, and Fennekin's evolution is kind of boring looking in my opinion.And are we going to see dual-type attacks? MAYBE!"
2013-09-11T09:34:05-0700,"Mega Garchomp?!! Really? As if it weren't broken enough, they give it Sand Force? For the love of... Gah! (For some reason, it reminds me of the anime Gurren Lagann 0_o)Mega Mewtwo, I honestly can't find anything to say about it...Chespin's evo is so dopey looking. Fennekin's evolution, even though I love foxes, looks... questionable. Froakie's evo looks cool I guess. Though now that I think about middle evos are never really what we expect.The blue cat Pokémon is pretty cool. I'm glad there will be more significant gender differences.That weird white, idk... poodle, thing. I don't get it.The Fossil Pokémon are okay (anybody else think of Chomper from Land Before Time?). The T-rex is cool and it gets an Iron Fist equivalent Ability. The blue Brachiosaurus looking one is a bit cutesy. But it's Ability is pretty neat, in that it changes Normal to Ice. Though Rock/Ice is an insanely horrible type combo.The Fairy-type chart spread seems pretty fair. It's interesting to say the least. I don't like how Steel loses resistances.All in all, it's an interesting update. though I pray for an epic final evo for Fennekin. Please for the love of all that's Pokémon >_<"
2013-09-11T16:22:32-0700,"I love all the new additions, some more than others. However I don't really care for the Megas but I wasn't a fan of Mewtwo (he really doesn't need 2 forms Dor Garchomp to begin with, so whatever."
2013-09-12T20:51:24-0700,Why did this get moved to VG discussion?It technically is gossip?
2013-09-12T21:41:18-0700,This is the VG game section on this news is VG related.
2013-09-13T07:20:47-0700,"Technically speaking I suppose.

2013-09-13T09:00:04-0700,"No worries, I was just a smidge confuzzled.Furfrou is my favourite!"
2013-09-13T09:36:44-0700,"Say, where did you find these names?"
2013-09-13T11:41:47-0700,On facebook pokemon posted a video.
2013-09-13T13:25:33-0700,"Furfrou is awesome. I hope that it's easy/inexpensive to change their style often. I'm tempted to assemble a stylish party of six Furfrou, all with different/complimentary cuts."
2013-09-13T14:32:06-0700,"It'd be awesome if you could ride Furfro around like you can Rhyhorn and stuff, and it'd show off your customization to it.I hope Tyrunt evolves and I can't wait to see what it evolves into. Tyrex maybe?"
2013-09-13T20:35:44-0700,"Pyroar's female has a little mane,"
2013-09-14T13:36:50-0700,"I am going to merge this thread with a similar thread, as it is all about new information on the X/Y games."
2013-09-19T07:36:33-0700,Aurorus + Tyrantrum were revealed!
2013-09-19T08:56:43-0700,I really like the look of the two dinosaur fossil Pokemon. Aerodactyl will blend in well with them.
2013-09-19T09:08:26-0700,"I'm wondering if there's going to be another new type revealed, besides Fairy. They were released in twos before. Then again, how much would it unbalance things? I feel like Dragon-types just got considerably less versatile, because now a Gardevoir (or Azurmarill/Blissey possibly?) can come out and potentially KO a Dragonite first turn. It will unbalance things even more if it's true that Dragon-type attacks won't affect Fairy-types (completely takes away the STAB advantage for single-type dragons like Haxorus). Mind you, this is from a more competitive prospective, so I suppose Fairys won't be as big a problem for most people."
2013-09-19T09:29:08-0700,"Well now you have to think, a lot of people are gonna gear their Dragons to counter Fairy. They're weak to Poison and Steel. Most Dragons can learn Steel type moves be it TM, Move Tutor, etc. and believe it or not some Dragons can learn Poison type moves. Though if you're anything like me, you'll probably just have another Pokemon that counters Fairy."
2013-09-19T09:46:36-0700,"Several things just gotconfirmed...1) XY Base Set will release on 2/5/14, just as I predicted.2) Kalos Starter Decks will release on 11/8/13. This is officially 2 days after Legendary Treasures releases in English.3) Kalos Starter Decks will contain Fairy Energy.4) There will be a ""Deluxe"" version of the Kalos Starter Decks that each contain a single BW-series booster pack."
2013-09-20T10:44:17-0700,"So therse Kalos starter decks, do they just come with a token XY starter and other random starter deck cards, or will they have the full Evos?"
2013-09-20T15:42:25-0700,Shouldn't this be discussed in the TCG area?
2013-09-21T14:01:49-0700,^ No thread to move the post's to in the TCG area. Unless it is a created thread to move them to.
2013-09-23T13:21:01-0700,Facebook will reveal another evo for a pokemon on Wednesday.Just thought I'd let you all know.
2013-09-23T15:20:11-0700,Maybe that silly bunny will evolve into a more sillier Roger Rabbit looking bunny?

2013-09-25T10:33:19-0700,"Obviously it'd be Triedge. *high-five to anyone who gets that*I wouldn't really say it's unimaginative, not quite like Dugtrio and Magneton, but more akin to Metang.Most notable look at the sheath, on Honedge its has a rather elaborate design, but on Doublade the sheath while less elaborate keeps with Honedge's design making it appear as if the sheath has parted. For instance the black bottom of Honedge is still present as the center piece of Doublade and the symmetrical lines have merely separated from each other. It's a pretty cool evolution that expands upon it in a rather neat way in my opinion."
2013-09-25T12:13:01-0700,Preface: Sorry if this has already been discussedSo...I just read this about XY: The opening cinematic is in 3D.

It was stated in an interview that putting 3D on the overworld would have meant they couldn't put as much detail into the world, so they opted for what they thought looked better."

Does that mean that walking around is not in 3D but the battles are?Any ideas on where I could read that interview?My son says that pokemon rumble blast is ALL in 3D. Is that not pretty detailed?sidebar: I probably care a little too much because I picked up the pikachu 3DS in anticipation of XY. :^)
2013-09-30T15:47:51-0700,"3D would I guess depend on the environment of the area. Sort of like how in BW&BW2- the bridge is sort of 3D, the graphics are restricted to the change from 45 degree top/down view. The battles would be nice to see in 3D, and in a way I think it will still be nice to see some of the top/down views for like going into the Pokémon Center or other buildings.We'll just have to wait and see what is 3D toggled."
2013-09-30T15:50:18-0700,"Does it really matter if some things are in 3D and some aren't? it's a new Pokemon game. It'll look fantastic even without 3D. But if i had to guess, the overworld well probably have a less noticeable 3D effect than the battle sequences."
2013-09-30T18:23:07-0700,"Well, it OBVIOUSLY matters to me! :^)"
2013-10-02T07:40:43-0700,Mega Charizard XSpritzee and Swirlix preevos!
2013-10-02T08:54:06-0700,"So they finally decided to make him a Dragon. Fire/Dragon is actually a good type combo since Fire cancels out Dragon's Fairy weakness. From what is said, Tough Claws increases the power of physical moves; most likely a glorified version of Huge Power. Plus it's Attack goes up upon M.Evolving, meaning with Tough Claws and an Attack boost, Charizard becomes a physical powerhouse with moves like Flare Blitz and Dragon Claw or even Outrage. Of course, a Charizard with Drought is also very appealing...Also makes you wonder if Venusaur and Blastoise will have another M.Evolution."
2013-10-02T14:45:32-0700,"Something to keep in mind about the 3D thing is there are two things 3D can refer to: stereoscopic 3D, that's the 3DS's trademark accessed using the slider on the side, or just 3D models and backgrounds. Pretty much the entire game has 3D models, from what we've seen. They can be wonderfully detailed, and in my opinion they all look great. However. For every item you have on the screen, if you put it in stereoscopic 3D the system has to create it twice. So if every single blade of grass is drawn twice, and every single tree and stump is drawn twice, it takes a LOT of power from the 3DS. Particularly if they still wanted it to play at a high framerate for smooth animations. It would drain the battery like nothing else. Saving the stereoscopic 3D for areas with less things in it makes life simpler."
2013-10-02T17:45:03-0700,"Should I post something that is confirmed, but not officially released?I know the names of 2 new evos."
2013-10-02T19:03:08-0700,"Okay, this is making more sense! I hope you are right! Even in Black/White, so much of it is already in 3D modeling. i.e. the town that is in a circle is a great example of this.So what you are saying is that it might be all in 3D like pokemon rumble blast but then the special things (like fights, etc) those would be in the stereoscopic 3D. Am I understanding you correctly?"

2013-10-03T13:32:54-0700,Your link isn't working. But we all saw the typing coming with some dispute over Water and Grass's typing.
2013-10-03T15:37:00-0700,The link should work?Just let it load.I've found a ton of new guys!!!
2013-10-03T19:28:38-0700,"I only want to know how many new Pokemon there are. I am afraid of the rumored 70 new Pokemon. I'm sure its false, but still. I also want to know if there are new evolutions of old Pokes besides Eevee.Then again, I'm ok with waiting 9 more days."
2013-10-03T20:34:52-0700,"Oh god why? Why, Fennekin?! ;_; I had such high hopes. Only to be disappointed. The fluff in its ears are way too big, and shouldn't it have a staff or something? It's such a bad design and doesn't transition well from it's middle evo. Thanks for dashing my foxy hopes, Fennekin.*Sigh* Anyway, the other 2 are cool i guess.Chespin's final evo is definitely a stark change from Quilladin. It's like a rodent ogre or something.Froakie's final evo, Greninja or whatever, is probably, now, everyone's number one choice.Also, anybody else notice that Fennekin's evolution is the only one not weak to Fairy (Fighting and Dark are weak to Fairy). In fact Fennekin's lines resist Fairy."
2013-10-03T21:01:16-0700,"I will point out that it kind of looks like a shrine maiden or it's in a kimono, which is actually very fitting considering foxes in Japanese myth. I know a couple of my friends opinions on it changed when I pointed that out, so here's hoping that it helps you see the good. Personally I really enjoy the direction they took with it.Didn't notice the last bit, I did however notice that they have a double weakness thing going on. Fighting > Dark > Psychic > Fighting mirroring the original circle of weaknesses."
2013-10-03T23:34:50-0700,"I'm sorry, I just don't like its design. Whatever its based on, I just don't. I had too high hopes for it.Also to clarify, Chesnaught (Chespin's final evo) is Water/Fighting. It has a signature move, Spike Shield, which protects it from damage and hurts the attacker if physical contact is made.Greninja (Froakie's final) is Water/Dark. To add to its ninjaness, its signature is Water Shuriken. Also it has an insanely high Speed stat."
2013-10-04T03:06:53-0700,"That's fine, to each their own. Some people grow an appreciation for Pokemon when they notice stuff like that (myself for example), but not everyone does.Also lol minor flub, Chesnaught is Grass/Fighting, not Water/Fighting.Spike Shield is interesting, and I've heard that Water Shuriken is priority that hits multiple opponents, so I wonder what it's base power will be. Still waiting on Mystic Fire it seems though."

2013-10-04T12:06:00-0700,whoops how did i not notice that? lolzI hadn't heard that about Water Shuriken. So maybe it's like a weaker Priority version of Surf. Kinda misplaced on a Pokemon that's so fast.
2013-10-04T12:37:51-0700,"Some of the new Pokemon look nice. I'm looking forward to trying Talonflame (still a bad name). It nots going to replace my Moltres though. As for some, I really do not like it when Pokemon are designed after human made objects."
2013-10-04T14:03:59-0700,I agree on all counts. I love how some look all Halloween style. My Flying-type will probably be Charizard and/or Noivern. Klefki is such a misfire. A key ring Pokemon? Really? The mon I'm most trippin' on is Goomy and Sliggoo. These are perhaps the most non-dragon looking Dragon-type Pokemon ever.
2013-10-04T22:08:11-0700,"The new Ghost and Grass types stole my heart.Just throwing this out there, but when they are released in card form, I'll be making bulk trades just for them"
2013-10-04T23:35:09-0700,Personally: I don't care as much for looks- I care more about some variety for types. Bring on the GHOST/GRASS!
2013-10-05T00:57:56-0700,"Yeah, I'm glad to have another fire flying bird Pokemon."
2013-10-05T01:18:02-0700,It looks like the game did away with the movement grids. I'm glad for this.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSZtpxrXygUContain spoilers.

2013-10-06T13:19:57-0700,I know a ton!!! Anyone interested in possible megas or preevos PM me.
2013-10-06T14:28:17-0700,Just post here. This thread is about leaks and such. No need to keep it private.
2013-10-06T14:45:13-0700,"I believe this has everything revealed so far aside from the 3rd legendary, which I'll spoiler below:https://scontent-b-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/1383666_10101585124873932_1705537212_n.jpg........"
2013-10-06T21:05:27-0700,Here is a better revealing one.
2013-10-06T22:38:53-0700,"I'm more hyped personally now that everything's been spoiled, wish it were the 12th already...lucky Canada/Italy peeps that managed to get it.Either that or this is the most elaborate fake info ever and should be praised."
2013-10-07T06:25:17-0700,"Are those numbers confirmed? If so, the rumor of about only 70 new poke are true, but it's closer to 100 with the mega evolutions. Honestly, I'd praise the, on that. Quality over quantity for one, and for 2, there's reportedly a big emphasis on the older pokemon, so that also makes sense.Lastly, with so few new poke, it should make it easy to feature them ALL in the first few XY TCG sets."
2013-10-07T07:25:45-0700,"Personally, I think its a bunch of crap that they cant make at least 100 quality Pokemon. I hate that the diversity of new Pokemon is so low. 1 Bug line is a disgrace."
2013-10-07T07:58:01-0700,"You need to remember that fairy is a new type, so they need to introduce more of em."
2013-10-07T14:52:14-0700,"I kinda wanted to see more new type combos, too. Like Poison/Dragon or Ghost/Fairy or Electric/Fire. IDK some other new cool combos to switch things up."
2013-10-09T09:41:19-0700,Okay so there IS a Poison/Dragon type.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK3sUqDsT44
2013-10-09T20:26:08-0700,"Wow, surprisingly enough, there are no Ground pokemon in this generation except for the legendary pokemon that starts with Z, and the mega evolution of Garchomp! Believe me, that'll be the first thing I'll correct when I can migrate some of my pokemon from earlier games. edit: Mind you, there are only 3 electric pokemon (so they may not come in as handy as I first thought), but they can be useful for poison (which again, there aren't many - 2 in total), fire, rock and steel."
2013-10-09T21:47:24-0700,"Well, you'll have to wait till December 27 to do so... I just want to pet my Pidgeot I've been raising since 4th gen. Sucks we have to wait so long to transfer."
2013-10-09T22:10:38-0700,I wanna play with my Sceptile I've kept since 3rd Gen. Quite honestly my very first Pokemon
2013-10-10T03:26:53-0700,"Really? That long? Wow, that sucks. I'll have finished with the game long before then. I may not even be interested in playing it anymore by then."
2013-10-10T11:53:51-0700,I have no idea why we have to wait till the end of the year. I'm not liking any of the decisions TPC are making lately.

2013-10-13T11:33:21-0700,"Is there going to be a thread for X&Y post release discussion?Anyhow had a look at all the new pokemon and I must say there's not as many as there has been. While I would have liked for there to be evolutions of previously released pokemon, it's kinda been done with the Mega-Evolution mechanic. I'm surprised at the limited number of new Legendaries. At least we have more chances to get the older legendaries. Though it seems they've moved away from getting mystery gift items for them, which I didn't really mind. Since the third new legendary begins with a Z, it seems likely we will have one third game with that Pokemon as the star ala Crystal/Emerald/Platinum. I hated that they did 2 expansion games for the Black and White series. It also seems they are moving away from adding tons of new pokemon as a whole, which IMO is a good thing. I'd prefer that they stop adding a million new pokemon every generation. I wouldn't mind new regions with the same old pokemon. I dream of the day that all 700 or so pokemon are obtainable in games of one generation. Would be awesome if there was a game with all of the current main regions to do this."

The battles would be nice to see in 3D, and in a way I think it will still be nice to see some of the top/down views for like going into the Pokémon Center or other buildings.We'll just have to wait and see what is 3D toggled."
2013-09-30T15:50:18-0700,"Does it really matter if some things are in 3D and some aren't? it's a new Pokemon game. It'll look fantastic even without 3D. But if i had to guess, the overworld well probably have a less noticeable 3D effect than the battle sequences."
2013-09-30T18:23:07-0700,"Well, it OBVIOUSLY matters to me! :^)"
2013-10-02T07:40:43-0700,Mega Charizard XSpritzee and Swirlix preevos!
2013-10-02T08:54:06-0700,"So they finally decided to make him a Dragon. Fire/Dragon is actually a good type combo since Fire cancels out Dragon's Fairy weakness. From what is said, Tough Claws increases the power of physical moves; most likely a glorified version of Huge Power. Plus it's Attack goes up upon M.Evolving, meaning with Tough Claws and an Attack boost, Charizard becomes a physical powerhouse with moves like Flare Blitz and Dragon Claw or even Outrage. Of course, a Charizard with Drought is also very appealing...Also makes you wonder if Venusaur and Blastoise will have another M.Evolution."
2013-10-02T14:45:32-0700,"Something to keep in mind about the 3D thing is there are two things 3D can refer to: stereoscopic 3D, that's the 3DS's trademark accessed using the slider on the side, or just 3D models and backgrounds. Pretty much the entire game has 3D models, from what we've seen. They can be wonderfully detailed, and in my opinion they all look great. However. For every item you have on the screen, if you put it in stereoscopic 3D the system has to create it twice. So if every single blade of grass is drawn twice, and every single tree and stump is drawn twice, it takes a LOT of power from the 3DS. Particularly if they still wanted it to play at a high framerate for smooth animations. It would drain the battery like nothing else. Saving the stereoscopic 3D for areas with less things in it makes life simpler."
2013-10-02T17:45:03-0700,"Should I post something that is confirmed, but not officially released?I know the names of 2 new evos."
2013-10-02T19:03:08-0700,"Okay, this is making more sense! I hope you are right! Even in Black/White, so much of it is already in 3D modeling. i.e. the town that is in a circle is a great example of this.So what you are saying is that it might be all in 3D like pokemon rumble blast but then the special things (like fights, etc) those would be in the stereoscopic 3D. Am I understanding you correctly?"

2013-10-03T11:36:09-0700,"I wish they just drop all the info now. With there being so much difference between the X and Y games, I want to make sure I get the right one."
2013-10-03T13:32:54-0700,Your link isn't working. But we all saw the typing coming with some dispute over Water and Grass's typing.
2013-10-03T15:37:00-0700,The link should work?Just let it load.I've found a ton of new guys!!!
2013-10-03T19:28:38-0700,"I only want to know how many new Pokemon there are. I am afraid of the rumored 70 new Pokemon. I'm sure its false, but still. I also want to know if there are new evolutions of old Pokes besides Eevee.Then again, I'm ok with waiting 9 more days."
2013-10-03T20:34:52-0700,"Oh god why? Why, Fennekin?! ;_; I had such high hopes. Only to be disappointed. The fluff in its ears are way too big, and shouldn't it have a staff or something? It's such a bad design and doesn't transition well from it's middle evo. Thanks for dashing my foxy hopes, Fennekin.*Sigh* Anyway, the other 2 are cool i guess.Chespin's final evo is definitely a stark change from Quilladin. It's like a rodent ogre or something.Froakie's final evo, Greninja or whatever, is probably, now, everyone's number one choice.Also, anybody else notice that Fennekin's evolution is the only one not weak to Fairy (Fighting and Dark are weak to Fairy). In fact Fennekin's lines resist Fairy."
2013-10-03T21:01:16-0700,"I will point out that it kind of looks like a shrine maiden or it's in a kimono, which is actually very fitting considering foxes in Japanese myth. I know a couple of my friends opinions on it changed when I pointed that out, so here's hoping that it helps you see the good. Personally I really enjoy the direction they took with it.Didn't notice the last bit, I did however notice that they have a double weakness thing going on. Fighting > Dark > Psychic > Fighting mirroring the original circle of weaknesses."
2013-10-03T23:34:50-0700,"I'm sorry, I just don't like its design. Whatever its based on, I just don't. I had too high hopes for it.Also to clarify, Chesnaught (Chespin's final evo) is Water/Fighting. It has a signature move, Spike Shield, which protects it from damage and hurts the attacker if physical contact is made.Greninja (Froakie's final) is Water/Dark. To add to its ninjaness, its signature is Water Shuriken. Also it has an insanely high Speed stat."
2013-10-04T03:06:53-0700,"That's fine, to each their own. Some people grow an appreciation for Pokemon when they notice stuff like that (myself for example), but not everyone does.Also lol minor flub, Chesnaught is Grass/Fighting, not Water/Fighting.Spike Shield is interesting, and I've heard that Water Shuriken is priority that hits multiple opponents, so I wonder what it's base power will be. Still waiting on Mystic Fire it seems though."

2013-10-04T12:06:00-0700,whoops how did i not notice that? lolzI hadn't heard that about Water Shuriken. So maybe it's like a weaker Priority version of Surf. Kinda misplaced on a Pokemon that's so fast.
2013-10-04T12:37:51-0700,"Some of the new Pokemon look nice. I'm looking forward to trying Talonflame (still a bad name). It nots going to replace my Moltres though. As for some, I really do not like it when Pokemon are designed after human made objects."
2013-10-04T14:03:59-0700,I agree on all counts. I love how some look all Halloween style. My Flying-type will probably be Charizard and/or Noivern. Klefki is such a misfire. A key ring Pokemon? Really? The mon I'm most trippin' on is Goomy and Sliggoo. These are perhaps the most non-dragon looking Dragon-type Pokemon ever.
2013-10-04T22:08:11-0700,"The new Ghost and Grass types stole my heart.Just throwing this out there, but when they are released in card form, I'll be making bulk trades just for them"
2013-10-04T23:35:09-0700,Personally: I don't care as much for looks- I care more about some variety for types. Bring on the GHOST/GRASS!
2013-10-05T00:57:56-0700,"Yeah, I'm glad to have another fire flying bird Pokemon."
2013-10-05T01:18:02-0700,It looks like the game did away with the movement grids. I'm glad for this.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSZtpxrXygUContain spoilers.

Quality over quantity for one, and for 2, there's reportedly a big emphasis on the older pokemon, so that also makes sense.Lastly, with so few new poke, it should make it easy to feature them ALL in the first few XY TCG sets."
2013-10-07T07:25:45-0700,"Personally, I think its a bunch of crap that they cant make at least 100 quality Pokemon. I hate that the diversity of new Pokemon is so low. 1 Bug line is a disgrace."
2013-10-07T07:58:01-0700,"You need to remember that fairy is a new type, so they need to introduce more of em."

2013-10-09T21:47:24-0700,"Well, you'll have to wait till December 27 to do so... I just want to pet my Pidgeot I've been raising since 4th gen. Sucks we have to wait so long to transfer."

At least we have more chances to get the older legendaries. Though it seems they've moved away from getting mystery gift items for them, which I didn't really mind. Since the third new legendary begins with a Z, it seems likely we will have one third game with that Pokemon as the star ala Crystal/Emerald/Platinum. I hated that they did 2 expansion games for the Black and White series. It also seems they are moving away from adding tons of new pokemon as a whole, which IMO is a good thing. I'd prefer that they stop adding a million new pokemon every generation. I wouldn't mind new regions with the same old pokemon.

2013-10-07T06:25:17-0700,"Are those numbers confirmed? If so, the rumor of about only 70 new poke are true, but it's closer to 100 with the mega evolutions. Honestly, I'd praise the, on that. Quality over quantity for one, and for 2, there's reportedly a big emphasis on the older pokemon, so that also makes sense.Lastly, with so few new poke, it should make it easy to feature them ALL in the first few XY TCG sets."
2013-10-07T07:25:45-0700,"Personally, I think its a bunch of crap that they cant make at least 100 quality Pokemon. I hate that the diversity of new Pokemon is so low. 1 Bug line is a disgrace."
2013-10-07T07:58:01-0700,"You need to remember that fairy is a new type, so they need to introduce more of em."
2013-10-07T14:52:14-0700,"I kinda wanted to see more new type combos, too. Like Poison/Dragon or Ghost/Fairy or Electric/Fire. IDK some other new cool combos to switch things up."
2013-10-09T09:41:19-0700,Okay so there IS a Poison/Dragon type.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK3sUqDsT44
2013-10-09T20:26:08-0700,"Wow, surprisingly enough, there are no Ground pokemon in this generation except for the legendary pokemon that starts with Z, and the mega evolution of Garchomp! Believe me, that'll be the first thing I'll correct when I can migrate some of my pokemon from earlier games. edit: Mind you, there are only 3 electric pokemon (so they may not come in as handy as I first thought), but they can be useful for poison (which again, there aren't many - 2 in total), fire, rock and steel."
2013-10-09T21:47:24-0700,"Well, you'll have to wait till December 27 to do so... I just want to pet my Pidgeot I've been raising since 4th gen. Sucks we have to wait so long to transfer."
2013-10-09T22:10:38-0700,I wanna play with my Sceptile I've kept since 3rd Gen. Quite honestly my very first Pokemon
2013-10-10T03:26:53-0700,"Really? That long? Wow, that sucks. I'll have finished with the game long before then. I may not even be interested in playing it anymore by then."
2013-10-10T11:53:51-0700,I have no idea why we have to wait till the end of the year. I'm not liking any of the decisions TPC are making lately.
2013-10-10T13:45:25-0700,"New Megas and official art for the final Starter evolutions.Mega Tyranitar, Aggron, Gengar, and Kangaskhan in ‘CoroCoro’"
2013-10-11T05:24:57-0700,"In others sites show all new pokemons. Are 69 pokemons, a small generation of new pokemons (cuz mega pokemons).I likeee a new dragon/poison, dragalge, this is a new combination of types. And Trevenant, a new ghost/grass pokemon."
2013-10-13T11:33:21-0700,"Is there going to be a thread for X&Y post release discussion?Anyhow had a look at all the new pokemon and I must say there's not as many as there has been. While I would have liked for there to be evolutions of previously released pokemon, it's kinda been done with the Mega-Evolution mechanic. I'm surprised at the limited number of new Legendaries. At least we have more chances to get the older legendaries. Though it seems they've moved away from getting mystery gift items for them, which I didn't really mind. Since the third new legendary begins with a Z, it seems likely we will have one third game with that Pokemon as the star ala Crystal/Emerald/Platinum. I hated that they did 2 expansion games for the Black and White series. It also seems they are moving away from adding tons of new pokemon as a whole, which IMO is a good thing. I'd prefer that they stop adding a million new pokemon every generation. I wouldn't mind new regions with the same old pokemon. I dream of the day that all 700 or so pokemon are obtainable in games of one generation. Would be awesome if there was a game with all of the current main regions to do this."

2013-07-01T19:10:29-0700,Well at least they're putting this out in advance...Did they ever finish releasing all the DW Pokemon yet? Or are we still doomed to not have our Lightning Rod Zapdos
2013-07-01T19:54:18-0700,They all have not been released yet. I still want my lightning rod zappy.
2013-07-01T19:56:08-0700,"^More then likely Doomed until after the release of 6th Gen. So many Pokémon that there is no access to with DW abilities that have yet to grace the Event stage.If anything- 6th Gen will more then likely ""host"" a good amount of DW Pokémon and hopefully they fix the ""Female only"" breeding transfer of the ability.

2013-07-01T21:59:00-0700,Hopefully they give ll pokemon genders and allow them to breed. I can mass produce lightning rod zappys and sell off the good offspring then sell the ones no one wants to KFC. ( No birds is safe here. We need more double downs)
2013-07-01T22:20:42-0700,"Uh, only problem is legendaries can't bred (unless you're Manaphy) anyways, so you can't really mass produce zappy even if they had genders."

2013-09-26T08:56:57-0700,Preface: Sorry if this has already been discussedSo...I just read this about XY: The opening cinematic is in 3D. (Have to mention this since most of the game isn't in stereoscopic 3D.)Does this mean that MOST of the game is NOT in 3D? I was under the assumption that the WHOLE game is in 3D? Not just certain parts. Am I understanding that correctly?thanks!ken

2013-09-27T01:57:06-0700,"the 3D graphics require additional processing by the hardware. The 3D graphics have to be rendered twice, once for the left eye and once for the right eye.in order to enable the stereoscopic 3D effect the game has to make some tradeoffs to maintain a stable frame rate. so basically games can opt to disable the 3D in order to push more complex graphics."

2013-09-04T10:24:33-0700,I think its a digital copy.
2013-09-04T12:19:31-0700,Same here I thought they would have come out with better name for it. Nintendo 2DS sound like it the per model for the 3DS.
2013-09-05T16:04:17-0700,Digital copies will be purchasable via eShop. If you have a digital and a cart version on one 3DS- both will not interact.
2013-09-19T06:51:32-0700,"I bought a pikachu 3ds when it came out in anticipation for XY. I have only been able to use the 3D for a couple games and for the street pass, but I think it's awesome! I can't imagine EVER buying a 2DS."
2013-09-19T07:28:35-0700,"I will probably end up getting the 2DS. Even though it'd be great to get a Pokemon 3DSXL for $200, the 2DS at $130 is just so much cheaper, and I can buy a Pokemon decal on the internet for it."

2013-08-09T11:05:31-0700,"From Pokebeach:This is pretty cool, and it's cool that the game makes it easier to do, but I wish the game made IV Individual Value breeding easier. Seems like it takes much longer to breed for the right IVs than it does to battle for the right EVs.What would be awesome, and this is just speculation, would be if X/Y removed IVs and just used Base Stats + EVs. That would be perfect."
2013-08-09T11:20:39-0700,Why credit Pokebeach instead of the official source?http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/whats_new/super_training/
2013-08-09T11:30:34-0700,"I hadn't seen the official web site, so I just credited where I saw the information."
2013-08-09T11:54:08-0700,This is interesting to me:Could it be that Super Training = EVs and Core Training = IVs?
2013-08-09T12:32:36-0700,"I wish Pokemon would stop treating EVs as if they were bases stats because they are completely different things. While this is a great tool for those who are not good at ev training, it does nothing to help pokemon who need a boost to compete. It looks like the system will stay the same."
2013-08-09T20:54:50-0700,"I'm surprised they've officially recognized base stats...I dunno, half of me almost thinks this is a way of boosting IVs rather than EVs, the text is a bit vague."
2013-08-10T01:09:14-0700,"I would rather have a way to boost IV's then EV's- think about it:I have been EV training forever, breeding for IV's - not as long, but- I can EV train in my sleep, but not for breeding.I think that since there has been so many things in favor of EV training, it is time for the IV's to get a boost for once as the newest addition to the training aspect of competitive play."
2013-08-10T05:59:22-0700,"I'm pretty certain that the terms ""Base Stat"", ""Effort Value"", and ""Intrinsic Value"" are fan-made names that just stuck. I doubt those are the internal names that TPC and GF uses for those values. For all we know, internally, what we call ""EV"" was always called ""Base Stat"", and that there was always a different term for what we call ""Base Stat""."
2013-08-10T12:08:30-0700,"Well, the word ""core"" could be what we call ""base stats"". IV's are flexible with in range of the max/min stat inside the base stats. EV's are additional boost's to increase the base stats.To what I understand is that ""all Pokémon share the common equal value""- meaning that there is a common shared equality for Pokémon that are the same in comparison with base stats. Two Charizards share the same ""core"" stats if they have the same nature in the case of having all IV's at 31 or all at 0- they will be equal in that ""core"".This is what keeps the Pokémon different and unique from each other= unless the ""base/core stats"" are exactly the same in all manners.What I would like to see change is that the IV's get dropped from the factor and allow for the nature and characteristics be the deciding factor that makes Pokémon unique from each other. There are a few things that would need to be considered such as if for example you do have two Pokémon that are the same in their Speed stat (over all with IV and EV with Nature) -- what would determine which Pokémon attacks first in battle?The games already randomly select which Pokémon goes first in the Speed order when there is a ""tie"" when the stats are totaled exactly, then alternates between the two for each round of battle on which will attack first.If there is a way to increase (IV training) the IV stats, then a few things will be satisfied in general for the player base in regards to the competitive scene:Less of a need to RNG and hackingMore of a level battle field for all players to be on the same chances of getting ""the best"" performance from a Pokémon in battles.Not so many battles being determined a winner based on ""low verse high IV's"" when the battles already have factors such as critical hits in the ""luck"", status inflictions, abilities, hold items, type coverage of the lack there of, and move sets.In a way, it sort of stinks to lose a battle based on IV's contributing or deterring a Pokémon from being able to serve it's purpose for the strategy. I would rather lose a battle to a critical hit instead of an IV stat being the main matter of giving my opponent the win.EV's are supposed to give you the advantage in a stat- it is a waste to invest your EV's into a Pokémon that has mediocre IV's- it is counter productive IMO. That advantage pay's off when the same Pokémon you are facing is not EV'd the same as yours is, and does not share the same Nature."
2013-08-10T12:13:36-0700,That what I was thinking but Creatures does recognize Effort Values because they named their in game thing the Effort-o-Metor. Its just super confusing.
2013-08-10T22:11:17-0700,"I think IVs make the game complicated for complicated sake and are not needed at all in the game. Base Stats + how you battle train your Pokemon should be the system. Leave the complicated part to breeding the right moves onto them, getting the right ability, and choosing the right item to equip to it."
2013-08-10T22:47:10-0700,"I agree with this but I would like to see stats work differently. I want a system where any Pokemon can be used competitively where you can train stats past a limit. No matter what system they choose to use, Pokemon will be the same strength always and others will outclass others. If you make a system where you can train a Pokemon stats as much as you like, people will use their favorites, which it what Pokemon should be."
2013-08-11T13:50:53-0700,"In that situation, players would only care about the ability and what moves the pokemon can learn. Shedinja becomes god-like because of his ability and now being able to escape his lower stats."
2013-08-11T14:24:20-0700,"It would need balance but Shedinja would still have 1 HP. We just need something to give all Pokemon a competitive chance or edge. It just seems with this gen, nothing would change yet again. We still dont know what else they plan to do though. I wish they would just tell us."
2013-08-11T14:29:31-0700,"I get you that certain Pokemon just don't see the light of day because they just aren't good enough. Maybe The Pokemon Company needs to institute a Modified Format-esque list of certain Pokemon that can be used this season at events, which changes every season. We have over 500 Pokemon now, so I don't think limiting the amount of playable Pokemon would remove too many options."
2013-08-11T14:35:45-0700,"Or they can just re-balance the base stats on each Pokemon. TPC does not know about any meta or are involved in it to make a list of Pokemon that can be used. This is normally left up to the community. What they can do is make sure that each Pokemon can be used competitively. This can easily be done by either giving a 80 to 120 base stat boost to weaker stage 2 pokemon and and like 60 or so to Pokemon that dont evolve or give them a hold item that boost their stats.With Mega Pokemon being shown to us, it confirmed what I was thinking and that was they dont plan to change base stats. Un-balance base stats are the problem with the games."
2013-08-11T16:07:28-0700,"I disagree that every Pokemon needs to be competitive. I can't think of a game where every character is competitive. Street Fighter, nor other miniature games, have a system where every piece is competitive. The truth of the matter is that for there to be good characters, there must be bad characters.Even if they boost weaker Pokemon, players are going to concentrate on the tip top best Pokemon, and there will still be Pokemon that can't be competitive because so many other Pokemon offer the same exact base stats but with a better ability to type or attack skill set."
2013-08-11T17:26:39-0700,"In the video games for ""story mode""- you need to have lower tier Pokemon. That is a given. Ever battle a gym leader who has an uber in his/her party with in the first 5 badges? You get to the E4, and you'll find better tier Pokemon with higher base stats.Their is some degree of balance in the tiers, as each Pokemon does have some use to it as you progress into the game. Here is (IMO) a better ""balance"" to the competitive scene with comparison to the story mode/ casual players:Types, and dual type combo Pokemon: competative has little to offer in higher tier base stats for type. Casual- anything goes for getting through the game.Competitive vs casual for tiers: casual is easier, just bring in higher leveled Pokemon- earn badge. Competitive- base stats matter more, restricted to a specific tier to remain competitive.Comp vs casual: Numbers per type for competitive base stats is out classed for abilities, move pool, and requires training, where as casual is just open range as long as you are hgher level.Boosting the numbers to add in and up-grade base stats among the Types and dual types to give the competitive players a larger tier will bring in better balance and more available stratagies.Casual play in an over all estimate really only needs 225 total Pokemon to get through the game and provide some variety in the battles you face in story mode. What does this guess say about the remaing 500 Pokemon?Lower to medium tier Pokemon is all you basically see until you reach the E4- and some small number (7-9 ish) of top tier OU Pokemon (that are 5-7 levels higher then your starting party, ie level 65-70ish)(or pulling a Lance)- and things like the battle Subway restrict what is usable- why not boost the base stats of some of the mid tier NU/RU Pokemon into the OU status instead of adding on another evolution, or a hold item?Break down what is RU, boost some of those up in the base stats."
2013-08-11T21:56:40-0700,"I always liked the Evolite item in Black/White because it helped non-fully evolved Pokemon be tougher.Perhaps there could be items that boost a certain stat if other stats are really low.So an item that boosts Speed if Def/SpDef is really low. Or boost HP if Atk/SpAtk is really low. So, it could be put on older Pokemon and they may just be more competitive then."
2013-08-14T04:01:03-0700,"I seriously wish I could ""thank"" this post 1000 times. Its exactly what needs to happen to truly open up the games for everyone competitively."
2013-08-14T12:42:09-0700,"As for the speed stat. I would like it more if they removed the speed ""tie"" and just make it if 2 Pokemon share the same speed at the same time, both Pokemon would attack at the same time and hit each other. Of course the game will take boost and other stuff in account.This way it removes that luck factor of and people saying ""I lost because the game let him move first""."

2013-07-11T10:36:44-0700,"Well, in Spanish pero = dog, so a puffy/cloudy dog wouldn't be too far off the mark. But really, cloud-dog?Where's my werewolf pokemon!"
2013-07-11T10:40:57-0700,Confused what you mean?It's been announced that it is fairy type for weeks.
2013-07-11T10:55:47-0700,"in your op, you put light type, thats why he asked that."
2013-07-11T12:22:20-0700,"Because these Pokemon aremuch less creative than a Pokeball with eyes, an assortment of eggs with eyes, or a pile of sludge with eyes. Each generation has Pokemon with simple designs and Pokemon with complex designs. Take off your notalgia goggles and enjoy each new slew of Pokemon on their own merit."
2013-07-11T12:30:03-0700,"According to Serebii, Peropuff is the 'Cotton Candy' Pokemon. Iiiiiineteresting.And the little bird is kinda weird.I don't mind the squids, I love their typing. Dark/Psychic. Heehee.Pancham's evo reminds me of Ursaring."
2013-07-11T13:53:15-0700,"I like the panda and the squidsNot liking the two Y exclusive mons, but it still has the cooler legendary imo.Cotton candy mon looks cute."
2013-07-11T14:21:58-0700,"I never said all 1st Gen Pokemon were epic, I'm just saying I see an increasing number of Pokemon named and made after inanimate objects and I think it's getting silly. I mean seriously, we've gotten a sword and perfume Pokemon... what's next? SmartPhonemon? Paperclipmon? Carmon? Penmon? Garbo.. oh wait."
2013-07-11T14:30:06-0700,"Can't speak for perfume, but Honedge is just the Pokémon-ization of longstanding monster myth/fantasy. Maybe one can appear in a Nintendo exclusive version of the next Soul Calibur game?"
2013-07-11T14:47:52-0700,"Ehh.. I dunno. Reality I'm just baffled there's a sword pokemon. I don't mind mixing things up... like maybe a Pokemon WITH a sword, or that cloud-dog thing, but having the Pokemon just be a living item is just boring to me."
2013-07-11T16:14:16-0700,I have to agree. I like it better when Pokemon are kind of like real animals or such. A sword Pokemon is just lame. Its just a bad a Voltorb and the ice cream cone Pokemon. but whatever I guess. There are bound to be some bad pokes.I just want to know about the birds and the eeveelutions.
2013-07-11T16:43:02-0700,I want to see a bat pokemon.No. Thebat pokemon.
2013-07-11T18:47:03-0700,"Ugh, really?Lets make more Pokemon!!! Good move...?"
2013-07-11T19:13:26-0700,"You like what you like, but frankly, your statement sounds backwards.A living, Ghost/Steel sword is exciting, and was it not for Golurk it could even seem rather novel. A Pokémon just wielding a sword is... a Pokémon with a sword; I mean that's Pokémon Tool territory. Just take a Machoke and give him a sword.Again though, you like what you like... your complaint just isn't making much sense to me."
2013-07-11T20:29:08-0700,"I dunno. I had on my short list of likes (without knowing the stats): Yveltal, Pancham, Noivern, Honedge...but now that more info is out...I think I prefer Xerneas over Yveltal. This is probably just me, but there are enough powerful Dark-types. Go with the Fairy. And it would be a good counter to all the Dragon Legendaries.Pancham evolves into another tough-looking bear, akin to Ursaring or Beartic. Eh.Noivern. Don't know much about it yet.Honedge, on the other hand, I do like. It seems to be a hit and miss with people. It's a hit for me. :biggrin: I just hope it has good stats or redeemable attributes to make it playable.Honorable mention to Talonflame. The name is cool, like a superhero or something. And the bird looks cool. Too bad it's going to be average. However, if it is indeed the ""starting"" bird, I could see myself using it for Fly, assuming that is still an HM."
2013-07-11T22:10:53-0700,Pokémon jumped the shark with character designs last set. a bunch a gears as a pokemon and Ice cream cones were so stupid you know that they were just made up to get a quota filled. So yes this next set of pokemon should be even worse. If the sword pokemon is an indication there will be a ton of really bad pokemon in this set.
2013-07-11T22:29:54-0700,"I pretty much have loved all the Pokemon so far, or at least liked them. Honedge is really awesome and I'm quite excited for him!I don't get the whole ""Pokemon have to be animals"" thing. They've never only been animals. Anyone remember Muk? He's a pile of pollution, for crying out loud. If that can be a Pokemon, why can't a possessed sword?"
2013-07-11T23:39:09-0700,"18 types, many combos to create with- has anyone yet discovered an animal that best fits a steel/ghost sort of creature to fit the type combo?Whomever thought that cultural myths being mixed into Pokemon is genius. Sure, it makes creativity in design less needed, but to be a world-wide game adding in that touch of culture is a bonus.Seems to me that Gamefreak is not working with just ""new"" designs, they are working with what is already there: 17 types.Expanding is one thing, adding in a new type like when they added dark and steel only opened the way to toss in stratagy among the battles.Fantasy, imagination, creativity, design- why should there be a restriction to it? If it is all left to expectation, there would be no original ideas to the concept of the above and it would become old and boring, plus repetitive."
2013-07-12T04:11:44-0700,"For GF it is, because it gives them 100-odd more things to sell toys and cards of."
2013-07-12T10:37:39-0700,"If we stop there, it is a truer statement, I think: Pokémon issilly.Just having an underlying ""animal"" or ""plant"" design doesn't make them more plausible, because the fantastic elements are still there. Pokémon are SPBs (Super Powered Beings), or whatever your preferred terminology is; they do things that break the laws of reality all the time. All of them can be stored inside tiny little balls, and all have an ""elemental affinity"" (sometimes two) that creates unrealistic relationships. Most designs are dubious in reality, especially upon closer inspection.Honedge is an adaptation of myth/legend just like Charizard. If there is a difference, it is that ""ghosts"" exist in the world of Pokémon... and once we allow for that, Honedge is actually more ""realistic"" than Charizard, Blastoise, Venusaur, etc.Again, you don't have to like it (as I have told others); if you think its stupid, you think its stupid. It is this implication of objective validity given to older Pokémon that is pretty absurd... because Pokémon are wonderfully absurd make-believe. If a Pokémon is too plausible, frankly its a failure!"
2013-07-12T12:10:51-0700,"I find Honedge more interesting than all three Starter Pokemon combined personally. Well, if they were actually combined together, maybe that would be more interesting..."
2013-07-12T13:58:48-0700,"I always thought Magneton could have been awesome... if it actually was threefused together. Probably too complicated for back then, but now... imagine if yes, you had to raise threeto the correct level to trigger it, but if you even only got to select which traits were used to create the Evolved form (e.g. which Ability, Nature, Moves, and each individual Stat...).As a Transformers fan, I totally want a team of five Pokémon I can optionally combine to make my sixth! I am sure it would be painfully hard to design, but would it not be worth the effort for the sheer awesome, even if it ultimately proved either too broken for competitive play, or too underpowered for the risks? :thumb:On a slightly more serious note, for the ""appropriate"" Pokémon (like Honedge), what about the option to... well... do what we've seen in the TCG; Honedge could ""treat"" itself like a Pokémon Tool for compatible Pokémon?"
2013-07-12T15:54:52-0700,"Goronda is now known asPangoroin English.Maika and Karamanero are known asInkay and Malamarrespectively.Shushupu is known asSpritzee.Peropuff is now calledSwirlix.Xerneas' attack Geo Control(Japanese) is now known asGeomancy.Yvetal's attack Death Wing(Japanese) is now calledOblivion Wing.And Otaku- your ideas are very magnificent and ambitious. If only we could have combining Pokemon or a ""Voltron"" mon!"
2013-07-12T18:20:20-0700,"Perhaps less ambitious is the idea of just two Pokémon linking up, with one acting like a Pokémon Tool (perhaps even being allowed to function as a second Pokémon Tool). Obviously it could be worthless, but to avoid it being overpowered we just need to make sure that mixing Pokémon this way is risky... and of course OHKO attacks already provide that. Attacks that discard Pokémon Tools might ""disconnect"" Pokémon functioning as Pokémon Tools, damaging or maybe even auto-Koing them.I just have this image in my head now of a Machoke with a Honedge attached to one hand, a Bronzor on the other, a Kabuto on its head, and maybe two different Unown (one on the front and one on the back of its torso), all glowing and cool looking."
2013-07-12T18:46:31-0700,"I really like that idea, though. Pairing up 2 Pokemon, even keeping the 6 limit, could make for some interesting mechanics! Honedge is just a very obvious example because its a sword, but other Pokemon could allow ""type alterations"" to attacks, like making a Water type attack from Empoleon be Fire type as well, if paired with a ""tooled"" Charizard. Or a Pokemon that is fast like Scyther could be paired up with something to add in a ""Quick Attack"" on top of each attack your Pokemon uses. Possibilities are endless on that front though, I guess.I did a quick search for you and couldnt bring it up, but I saw a really neat picture of Golurk with a Brozor and Honedge superimposed on it like a sword in shield- your idea reminded me of it. It was just the Sigi art, but because all 3 of their colors are so similar, it still looked neat."
2013-07-14T17:23:42-0700,"I think this gen's Pokemon released so far are much cooler than the ones from gen 5... personal opinion, but Gen 6 is shaping up as much more interesting... The theme is ""European"" in my mind and some of the Pokemon fit much more clearly...Europe makes me think of all of these Pokemon, to a certain extent. In medieval times, there seemed to be a lot more wonder in the world (unicorns and dragons and fairies, oh my), even if that's only modern perception of people's beliefs. Honedge has a Medieval look to it, perfume makes me think of France, and... okay, I can't really think of a place for pandas, but I like these more than Spinda. The lion-looking Pokemon, too, make me think of Trafalgar Square and coats of arms.Gen 5 had themes, of ideals and dreams, and the location was very futuristic, but not all the Pokemon tightly fit that as it was sort of difficult design-wise. It was about stark opposites and how the distance between them is not always clear... but that's pretty hard to convey in a whole set of Pokemon, although they did fine with the legendaries."
2013-07-14T22:13:30-0700,Im still hoping for a tiger pokemon to come out... lol
2013-07-15T09:51:02-0700,"Gen 3's theme was duality. There were a LOT of Pokemon pairs in that generation. (gen 4's theme was history)I think gen 5's design theme was more about ""familiar, but new"", since it was the first game taking place outside of Japan."
2013-07-11T10:05:49-0700,"Goronda - Pancham's evolved form.Maika + Karamanero - Squid Pokemon! <3Shushupu - Ugly looking thing... The ""Perfume"" PokemonProbably will evolve into a flamingo.Peropuff - I see this turning into a cloud dog...Additional Notes:Xerneas is confirmed as a fairy type.Yveltal is dark/flyingPokemon exclusive to X: Clauncher, PeropuffPokemon exclusive to Y: Skrelp, ShushupuNow I'm stuck. I like Peropuff but also like Skrelp"

Or a Pokemon that is fast like Scyther could be paired up with something to add in a ""Quick Attack"" on top of each attack your Pokemon uses. Possibilities are endless on that front though, I guess.I did a quick search for you and couldnt bring it up, but I saw a really neat picture of Golurk with a Brozor and Honedge superimposed on it like a sword in shield- your idea reminded me of it. It was just the Sigi art, but because all 3 of their colors are so similar, it still looked neat."
2013-07-14T17:23:42-0700,"I think this gen's Pokemon released so far are much cooler than the ones from gen 5... personal opinion, but Gen 6 is shaping up as much more interesting... The theme is ""European"" in my mind and some of the Pokemon fit much more clearly...Europe makes me think of all of these Pokemon, to a certain extent. In medieval times, there seemed to be a lot more wonder in the world (unicorns and dragons and fairies, oh my), even if that's only modern perception of people's beliefs. Honedge has a Medieval look to it, perfume makes me think of France, and... okay, I can't really think of a place for pandas, but I like these more than Spinda. The lion-looking Pokemon, too, make me think of Trafalgar Square and coats of arms.Gen 5 had themes, of ideals and dreams, and the location was very futuristic, but not all the Pokemon tightly fit that as it was sort of difficult design-wise. It was about stark opposites and how the distance between them is not always clear... but that's pretty hard to convey in a whole set of Pokemon, although they did fine with the legendaries."
2013-07-14T22:13:30-0700,Im still hoping for a tiger pokemon to come out... lol
2013-07-15T09:51:02-0700,"Gen 3's theme was duality. There were a LOT of Pokemon pairs in that generation. (gen 4's theme was history)I think gen 5's design theme was more about ""familiar, but new"", since it was the first game taking place outside of Japan."
2013-07-11T23:39:09-0700,"18 types, many combos to create with- has anyone yet discovered an animal that best fits a steel/ghost sort of creature to fit the type combo?Whomever thought that cultural myths being mixed into Pokemon is genius. Sure, it makes creativity in design less needed, but to be a world-wide game adding in that touch of culture is a bonus.Seems to me that Gamefreak is not working with just ""new"" designs, they are working with what is already there: 17 types.Expanding is one thing, adding in a new type like when they added dark and steel only opened the way to toss in stratagy among the battles.Fantasy, imagination, creativity, design- why should there be a restriction to it? If it is all left to expectation, there would be no original ideas to the concept of the above and it would become old and boring, plus repetitive."
2013-07-12T04:11:44-0700,"For GF it is, because it gives them 100-odd more things to sell toys and cards of."
2013-07-12T10:37:39-0700,"If we stop there, it is a truer statement, I think: Pokémon issilly.Just having an underlying ""animal"" or ""plant"" design doesn't make them more plausible, because the fantastic elements are still there. Pokémon are SPBs (Super Powered Beings), or whatever your preferred terminology is; they do things that break the laws of reality all the time. All of them can be stored inside tiny little balls, and all have an ""elemental affinity"" (sometimes two) that creates unrealistic relationships. Most designs are dubious in reality, especially upon closer inspection.Honedge is an adaptation of myth/legend just like Charizard. If there is a difference, it is that ""ghosts"" exist in the world of Pokémon... and once we allow for that, Honedge is actually more ""realistic"" than Charizard, Blastoise, Venusaur, etc.Again, you don't have to like it (as I have told others); if you think its stupid, you think its stupid. It is this implication of objective validity given to older Pokémon that is pretty absurd... because Pokémon are wonderfully absurd make-believe. If a Pokémon is too plausible, frankly its a failure!"
2013-07-12T12:10:51-0700,"I find Honedge more interesting than all three Starter Pokemon combined personally. Well, if they were actually combined together, maybe that would be more interesting..."
2013-07-12T13:58:48-0700,"I always thought Magneton could have been awesome... if it actually was threefused together. Probably too complicated for back then, but now... imagine if yes, you had to raise threeto the correct level to trigger it, but if you even only got to select which traits were used to create the Evolved form (e.g. which Ability, Nature, Moves, and each individual Stat...).As a Transformers fan, I totally want a team of five Pokémon I can optionally combine to make my sixth! I am sure it would be painfully hard to design, but would it not be worth the effort for the sheer awesome, even if it ultimately proved either too broken for competitive play, or too underpowered for the risks? :thumb:On a slightly more serious note, for the ""appropriate"" Pokémon (like Honedge), what about the option to... well... do what we've seen in the TCG; Honedge could ""treat"" itself like a Pokémon Tool for compatible Pokémon?"
2013-07-12T15:54:52-0700,"Goronda is now known asPangoroin English.Maika and Karamanero are known asInkay and Malamarrespectively.Shushupu is known asSpritzee.Peropuff is now calledSwirlix.Xerneas' attack Geo Control(Japanese) is now known asGeomancy.Yvetal's attack Death Wing(Japanese) is now calledOblivion Wing.And Otaku- your ideas are very magnificent and ambitious. If only we could have combining Pokemon or a ""Voltron"" mon!"
2013-07-12T18:20:20-0700,"Perhaps less ambitious is the idea of just two Pokémon linking up, with one acting like a Pokémon Tool (perhaps even being allowed to function as a second Pokémon Tool). Obviously it could be worthless, but to avoid it being overpowered we just need to make sure that mixing Pokémon this way is risky... and of course OHKO attacks already provide that. Attacks that discard Pokémon Tools might ""disconnect"" Pokémon functioning as Pokémon Tools, damaging or maybe even auto-Koing them.I just have this image in my head now of a Machoke with a Honedge attached to one hand, a Bronzor on the other, a Kabuto on its head, and maybe two different Unown (one on the front and one on the back of its torso), all glowing and cool looking."

2013-06-13T13:28:14-0700,"With 6th Gen coming out in October adding in more Pokémon- What do you think about it changing the competitive scene with the current Meta Game?Fairy Type will for sure shake things up, but in what ways?There will be newer moves, hopefully some stronger Attacks will be included into Types that have very little support, like Poison Types. Do you think Pokémon will have stronger Attacks that will switch up the tactics a bit?Will the first Regionals VGC Tournament be 6th Gen Pokemon only?So many questions, I do not want to make a lengthy list of them, but change is coming soon to the VGC format.What are your thoughts on the VGC Competitive Scene with the release of 6th gen?"
2013-06-13T14:56:19-0700,I want to see some balance in the game. I dont want to see Shell Smash or moves like it. I just want to know more about the fairy types matchup.VGC will be different for sure this yeah. Fairy types having immunities to dragon type attacks are huge for sure.
2013-06-13T16:56:50-0700,Does Fairy actually have immunity (or even resistance) to Dragon? Or are Fairy attacks merely Super Effective against Dragons?
2013-06-13T17:21:57-0700,According to the leak yes linkhttp://pokebeach.com/2013/05/supposed-pokemon-x-and-y-insider-informationSo it is unsure if dragon immunity is real or fake
2013-06-13T18:35:31-0700,"IMO, Fairy's effectiveness will ultimately depend on its immunities or resistances; for example, if it doesn't have either vs Dragon, I'd much rather have a Steel type still because something like Metagross can take Dragon attacks with impunity and still nab a 2HKO in good situations. Otherwise, what's the benefit of a SE Fairy attack on a Dragon when you can use your own Dragon to beat it in also? So guess we'll see if that rumor is true or not, otherwise just weakness to Poison and Steel isn't that bad. What I don't get is the fire resistance, kinda odd Fire Pokemon would randomly be resistant to Fariy.../shrug"
2013-06-13T18:51:02-0700,Fairy Type Attacks will be interesting to see what comes about.Attacks like Will-O-Wisp- a possibility that Fairy type couls recieve support in this area.It will be interesting to see what Pokemon will have access to any Fairy type attacks- this I can not wait to see what comes about in all of this. Like a TM?
2013-06-13T19:59:32-0700,"A couple of questions...I'm not really much of a competitive player -- play for fun -- but I do value competitive stats and whatnot versus other Pokemon in a game. With that said, I have a couple of questions.1) First, why did they make Dragon type so powerful in the first place, only to find a need to balance it out with the Fairy type? Seems silly on hindsight. *Shrug*2) Regarding a comment someone made on restoring the ""power creep"" in the game. How would you do that, besides maybe either lowering and/or increasing overall base stats? And wouldn't that upset people if, say, Dragonite's base stats dropped 50-100 points?I'm personally looking forward to seeing Fairy types, though, and hope that there are some nicely balanced, if not powerful Pokemon in that category. The second thing that piques my interest from the new information is the horde battle. One on five sounds awesome, unless your Pokemon isn't prepared, of course. Oh, and stepping on Pokemon...LOL."
2013-06-13T20:31:34-0700,"The first thing is Base Stats need to change. Some Pokemon have a base stat of 470 as a stage 2 Pokemon while other have 600. Yes some species of Pokemon are better then other and it should be that way but all Pokemon need a competitive edge. The way to do this is not by making attacks like Shell Smash. Balanced Base Stats should be the thing looked at and tied with the species the Pokemon is based on but animals have a competitive edge over others even though they may not be stronger.The idea is to balance out the stats so the competitive scene does not become about using the best or making a team of ""good stuff"". Since this is a new game, they have the change to fix this. Perhaps the Lati twins dont need a base stat total of 600, the same as other Pokemon like Metagross and other who also have very powerful movepools. Abilities also need to be unique to the Pokemon and be useful. Keen Eyes which is a ability on most bird Pokemon should mean their attacks always hit. Most abilities are useless in competitive play.If you remember, the ability Sturdy use to be where the Pokemon was unable to be hit my moves that KOed in 1 hit but not its changed to if a attack would KO them at full HP, they have one HP left, like Focus Sash. That ability is overpowered in competitive play. The game as of now fixed power creep with more power creep and it needs to stop. They have a fresh start for this so I hope they do this."
2013-06-13T22:03:20-0700,"Guess that would kind of line up with the example that I gave, in reducing Dragonite (and other pseudo-Legendaries). I would love to see more of my ""favorite"" Pokemon with better/balanced stats. In studying base stats rather extensively the last couple of months, there are few non-Legendaries that even break 100 in both Attack and Special Attack...for example. Of course, that may or may not be a focus to people in the more competitive circle. I don't like to zone in on Legendaries to make a great team...variety is nice.As for abilities, what you suggest would be nice...Heatran, for example, seems rather unique in ability as combined with stats. But there are many...most?...that I look at their abilities and gloss over them as being completely useless to my agenda. Maybe, with Pokemon like Reshiram and Zekrom...though part of their appeal are in their stats, it seems what makes them so cool are their ability to bypass Sturdy, etc. Heh, then again, is that power creeping the power creep still? A good marriage of the two (stats with ability) would go a long way to make more interesting Pokemon.Just my two cents. Oh, and I guess it was you who mentioned the power creep comment...finally found that post. (Just wanted to clarify ""credit"" as such.)"
2013-06-13T22:39:50-0700,"Another thing with abilities is to balance them. Why give a Pokemon with Dragon Dance the ability Moxie? I would like more Pokemon unique abilities and not those that change the flow of battle. Speed Boost needs to only go off once, not 6 times.As for the legendaries with abilities, they also need balance. Mold Breaker was hard to deal with but a pokemon with 670+ base stats with a ability that ignores everything is a bit OP."
2013-06-13T22:59:09-0700,"Your complaints are with a bunch of combinations that don't even see much play in tournaments. I can't remember the last time I saw a Scrafty use Dragon Dance or Moxie (ok maybe 2011). The most use Sturdy sees is LV1 Aron of all things. I don't think I've ever seen Shell Smash used by a competent player and nerfing Latias is the last thing that needs to be done...Benzo, the games will likely come out either around or after the first set of Regionals. Gen 5 will still almost certainly be used for the first regional of the new season.There was only one Dragon type in Gen 1 and no dragon attacks aside from Dragon Rage which always did a set 40. So when GSC came along, they didn't have anything to fix. That was the last time the type chart was changed. 4 generations later, enough has changed that they feel the type chart needs to be changed up a bit!"
2013-06-14T00:45:38-0700,"Agreed. That would be the flipside to what I said about Reshiram/Zekrom. (Though I must say, I do love Mold Breaker when going again something with Sturdy. Rogenrola drives me crazy. LOL) I think, in part, that's what the horde battles are supposed to counter?In the games I play, I've come to the point where I try to use Pokemon other than Legendaries and pseudo-Legendaries. It's a challenge, though, given that the stats are so stacked in their favor; and it is no doubt worse in actual competition. Honestly, I'd probably not do well against such competition.Realistically, I can see them MAYBE giving some of the new Pokemon greater power, but not doing much with the older generations. It is much easier for someone to upgrade on a macro-level than it is to downgrade. Makes me think of the Power Rangers. As the series progresses, the creators find the need to mega the mega-zords or whatever. Eventually, it gets entirely ridiculous and they reboot with a new Power Rangers series...starting the cycle over again. Similarly with the TCG. Can X/Y actually reboot?"
2013-06-14T01:02:41-0700,"If they have decided to up the base stats of Pokemon, this alone will break the normal for sure. So many Pokemon that I like can't hang at all in the VGC- even with an ability.Some abilities are circumstantial, some are useless, while some make me wonder how it even helps the Pokemon with weak base stats in the first place.One thing that would be nice is not having to rely on Dream World to get Pokemon with a new ability. As it is, breeding for some Pokemon is time consuming since it has three abilities and requires the female to pass it on.Base stats alone even with a 31 IV still make a good number of Pokemon unable to hang in VGC, yet with in the game story line they are great battlers. I would like to see more balance in available Pokemon Types become more worthy of seeing the battle front line.In many ways- I tend to forget the game itself as I focus on the competitive side. It is not like you start a game out with the toughest of Pokemon (unless your like me and trade over Pokies after having 6 and blast through the main story line to get to the ""building"" a competitive team which most of the time is not right away available until later on in the story line)- so I do see why some Pokemon are just ""stepping"" stones just to get you through the story line.I think they should balance out or add in some Pokemon that do make for battle worthyness. Like, how many Poison Type Pokemon see the VGC? Bug? Ground? Flying? Just an increase of competitive worthy Pokemon for each Type.Sure, Dragon Type is the Psychic Type of 1st Gen currently- so adding in balance to that is understandable. But advancing into the competitive side of additional Pokemon into the roster Type wise- probably the last thing they consider to change in the games, since the game is RPG and not an all out ""VGC"" game only feature.I wonder how the transition of the move sets will go for converted Pre 6th Gen Pokemon goes as far as move line-up. It almost seems as if the move leveling up process will lose some moves to be replaced by the new Fairy Type, but will this be a good change or bad? Or will there be an option to choose either or move at level up?"
2013-06-14T01:06:13-0700,"I hope XY can reboot. With them adding fairy type to the game and making some older Pokemon fairies as well, they also have the power to change the stats of Pokemon. XY is a completely new game to the series as its adding things. BW was handled poorly and I do hope they learned from it. The best place to start would be to raise the stats of Pokemon who need them or lower the big ones altogether."
2013-06-14T01:43:13-0700,They've said IV/EV will be more noticable in X/Y and I hope it is easier to control that massive breeding/hatching that leads to players RNGing.

I wouldn't mind losing some of the old moves if it means upgrading quality of attacks. But they probably don't even have to cut any/many out to add more; the games themselves are becoming more efficient at holding more information."
2013-06-14T11:46:37-0700,"^That is a point I was going to mention as well: the game's memory size verses the older cartridges. If they up the amount of TM's, or cut the amount of TM's, and have more move tutors- the Pokémon can have a higher move list available to them. Dropping weaker attacks for stronger ones: I am all for it. Sure, attacks like Poison Sting will be there, but having a mid-rang attack at final evolution stage and then being able t up-grade to an even stronger attack via move tutor or TM to make it more competitive will be nice."
2013-06-15T13:41:15-0700,"The thing is, Dragon types inherently aren't that super powerful in terms of typing; being weak to themselves and Ice hurts, and as many posses a flying subtype, that makes Ice even worse for them as well as opening up a Rock weakness and losing Electric resistance. The fire/water/grass resistance is nice, but it's not like they have tons of resistances like Steel. Again, Dragon only hits itself for Super Effective damage, only Normal is weaker from an attacking perspective since it hits nothing SE and hits 2 for resisted damage and can't touch ghost at all.Rather, dragon is only ""strong"" because of a couple of factors. It possesses 2 powerful attacks: Draco Meteor and Outrage, which given the lack of resistances or immunities (only Steel types resist dragon attacks) and their high base power (140 and 120) gives them almost universal coverage and basically 1 big nuke in the case of Draco Meteor that you can inflate with Choice Specs or Dragon Gem. If anything Draco Meteor I think is the main problem, as doubles seems to centralize to a degree over it and what Pokemon can take a hit and survive it; this is why a steel type is all but obligatory on most teams, as well as having your own dragon or moves to deal with it simply because Draco Meteor has OHKO power on most Pokemon, and in doubles with only 4 Pokemon, losing one is a lot more damaging than Singles. The other thing dragon has going for it is that the most popular ones (Salamence, Hydreigon, Garchomp, Dragonite) all are in the upper level of base stats for normal Pokemon.Consider for Psychic types (the old dominant typing back in RBY), its strongest attack accessible by most of their type is Psychic, which caps at 90 BP. Deoxys has Psycho Boost (which is a psychic Draco Meteor), but its unusable under most rulesets, not to mention Deoxys is incredibly frail defensively. And then you have ruinous Pokemon like Chansey or Blissey that can wall them to death unless they happen to use Psyshock instead.So honestly? You take away Draco Meteor from being a tutor move just about any can get and make it exclusive to the legendaries like Palkia and such (Outrage is more manageable, being unusable in doubles and easily switched out of in singles), add in another weakness and a couple of Pokemon that can resist Dragon other than Steel, and I think that could balance them out without having to throw in a new type to counter them and others like Dark."
2013-06-15T13:49:22-0700,"Like someone was mentioning over at Nugget Bridge, it'd actually be kinda nice if they just did away with IVs; then junk like certain sites where you can download Pokemon wouldn't have much purpose, it evens out the playing field a bit (as every Pokemon is basically a clean slate to just imprint EVs onto), and for Hidden Power, you can simply do away with it or make it like some stones you can click on to select a type for it (like how you can swap Rotom forms by going to the right appliance)."
2013-06-17T04:36:24-0700,"I mentioned this exact same IV idea over on beach, along with them blocking or simply not allowing transfer of mons from BW1&2 to not create a headache with the new mechanic. Most did not like the idea lol."
2013-06-17T11:43:28-0700,I'd like to see the removal of IVs as well. They dont do what they are suppose to do anymore with competitive players.
2013-06-18T16:56:08-0700,"Exactly, and with the loss of the IV mechanic, leaving just an EV mechanic in its place- with more visibility in the games- would level the playing field for newcomers and veterans (who have less than a stellar amount of time on hand to train, breed or even RNG).I had no problem RNGing in BW once I figured it out, and even though its much faster than breeding for that desired shiny with perfect stats, or a perfect legend, its still time consuming. Being an adult with a full time job, its very hard to find time to even use the Pokemon products I have loved for over a decade. With the advent of online tournaments the last couple years, this would increase my chances of jumping into the competitive scene (same goes for PTCGO as well though)."
2013-06-18T17:17:37-0700,"Having the IV's removed is a good idea. Allowing the base stats to determine the placement of EV's is IMO a better route to take. Breeding will be less pressuring. I think that over all- type should be the main factors in what weakness is verses the need for IV's to determine any advantage.Take 2 Pokemon that are the same: Charizard vs Charizard-You will need to place your EV's in the stats you are wanting to be ""advantage"" if you are looking to win a speed war for example. Isn't that what Nature and Personality is for?No two Pokémon are the same- yet the base stats are the same and having IV's be the factor to keeping them different is sort of contradicting IMO."
2013-06-19T10:16:28-0700,"There would need to be a system to not make all Pokemon the same but easier to maintain then IVs. Not many players know about IVs or EVs and have no real chance to compete with the likes of those who do. Still the advanced players need a learning curve to get over but since the internet and competitive play, the IV and EV system are out of date. Then again the turn based PvP system is out of date."
2013-06-19T16:37:45-0700,"Personally, I think the nature system should just be expanded to offset a removal of IVs. Example being: Malicious nature= Atk +5% Sp. Atk +5% Defense -10% or Courteous nature= +5%Def/Sp Def -10% Speed.If they added as many natures for every split positive combo and split negative combo, would would get a psuedo variety effect. While not as ""varied"" as having an IV determine 2 points for a stat at level 100, it certainly would give each Pokemon a more varied outcome than the current nature system alone.Just an idea, but Id really like to see IVs go the way of the buffalo.EDIT: Getting even more in depth- they could even add in +15 -15 natures to give even greater variety."
2013-06-19T19:30:19-0700,"^ ????It might just be me, I am not understanding what you are saying.Are you saying that Nature and personality will effect base stats in replacement of the IV system?Or, that the base stats are solid and the nature auto add/subtract's the difference from the max total from the base stat +/- 15 ?Example:Base stat attack is say 100. Total stat count (without any EV's added) is say 200. EV'd would be 300So, if modest nature, the attack stat is - 15 per 100 count? So a modest nature would total 255 max? If you wanted to add in EV's, it would still not hit max of 300.Or, am I just way off on what you are saying?"
2013-06-20T04:47:37-0700,"Sorry, I was probably a bit tired when I wrote that- so it may seem garbled and hard to understand.Currently, the nature system gives bonuses and deductions to certain stats. We only have 24 natures available at this time, but Im suggesting adding more with more varied differences in the stat increases and decreases.So currently, there are 4 natures that do nothing such as Docile, while there are 4 natures that boost attack, defense, sp atk, sp def, and speed respectively, while lowering one of those 5 specific stats depending on the nature.The amount that the current natures raise a stat is 10%, while the one each nature lowers is lowered by 10%. So, each nature modifies 2 base stats of a Pokemon using a 10% exchange.If they added in, say, 20 MORE natures to the mix, we could see much more varying stat exchanges, which would keep each Pokemon's uniqueness to some degree, and offer a simpler alternative to IVs.My examples were- instead of keeping just the 10% exchange rate, they could make natures that have an exchange rate of 15%, so lowering 3 stats by 5% and raising 1 by 15%. OR lowering a stat by 5% and one by 10% and raising 3 other stats by 5%.Im not sure if I explained it better this time or not, but hopefully you get what Im saying. This is just how I think the nature system could be expanded to somewhat replace the variance that IVs have given us."
2013-06-20T12:48:09-0700,"^ Now that I understand, lol. I think I was a bit on the tired side myself.Adding in more natures would be nice to toss into the pool of available stat +/- side of things vs relying on IV's.The thing with IV's is that from a 0-31 ""random"" (which is not) the odds of getting a great/excellent Pokémon is too much in favor of the weaker side. And tossing in the Natures, this adds into more of the weaker side.Having a zero IV in attack on an adamant nature is crud in it's own, but this is worse:31 IV in special attack, zero IV in attack, adamant nature.Now, breeding with all the breeding mechanics and getting this as a result without having to jump through a lengthy process, with the female dream world ability, - I could go on-without knowing how to rng- your looking at the IV system as being more of a hindering and time consuming knowing that you will have a greater chance at having a Pokémon that still sits on the lower end of the ""excellent"" side of the line due to IV's."
2013-06-20T14:19:47-0700,I would also like some kind of in game way to change a Pokemons ability when you want. You could do this in Pokemon Conquest so I would like to see it return. Would also help me not breed different Pokemon for abilities.
2013-06-21T00:15:59-0700,"^That would be cool- but I highly doubt that will be a new feature. In the competitive side of abilities, there are only so many that are worth it for battle use. Plus, some Pokémon have 3 abilities, and some still have abilities that are not even available to them.Breeding for a battle worthy Pokémon and having this as an option to be able to select which ability: golden. Perhaps to golden, so breeding mechs will still be the same I am afraid to say.What about triple and rotation battles? Anything other then double battles is rather bleh for the competitive scene. Air battles, under water battles maybe?I think that if they are going to spice things up a little, I think environments being a bit more interactive would be sort of cool. Imagine in a tournament where the grass is burnt a little from a flamethrower attack. Some small amount of back ground interaction would be sort of cool.New thought:Fairy type:This new type obviously will shake things up- but to what extent? Will it be a better off thing to just have a non-fairy type have a fairy type attack or will it be better to use a Fairy type in your team?Moves, move power: we can at least expect 15 fairy type attacks. What do you guys think?"
2013-06-21T07:37:07-0700,"IMO, and this is just how I play (in the non-competitive environment), I like power stats -- Attack, Special Attack. If there are no Fairy types with the ability to KO things well, I'd defer to a non-Fairy type using a Fairy attack. Or a Dragon with a super-effective Fairy counter.Otherwise, a nice Fairy with monstrous stats would be kinda neat."
2013-06-21T14:29:08-0700,"If anything, I hope they do not ""double up"" on attacks onto a Pokémon that are super effective- like, they decide that the new Fairy types will have Dragon and Fairy type attacks. Sort of how some Pokémon learn Ice and Dragon attacks.In all, there should be a list of new attacks that will boost power to Pokémon for their type to get STAB.Dark for example could use a boost in the move pool department as far as having attacks that will offer the choice of available Pokémon for the competitive scene. That alone will be great in adding to the list of battle worthy Pokémon."
2013-06-13T13:28:14-0700,"With 6th Gen coming out in October adding in more Pokémon- What do you think about it changing the competitive scene with the current Meta Game?Fairy Type will for sure shake things up, but in what ways?There will be newer moves, hopefully some stronger Attacks will be included into Types that have very little support, like Poison Types. Do you think Pokémon will have stronger Attacks that will switch up the tactics a bit?Will the first Regionals VGC Tournament be 6th Gen Pokemon only?So many questions, I do not want to make a lengthy list of them, but change is coming soon to the VGC format.What are your thoughts on the VGC Competitive Scene with the release of 6th gen?"
2013-06-13T14:56:19-0700,I want to see some balance in the game. I dont want to see Shell Smash or moves like it. I just want to know more about the fairy types matchup.VGC will be different for sure this yeah. Fairy types having immunities to dragon type attacks are huge for sure.
2013-06-13T16:56:50-0700,Does Fairy actually have immunity (or even resistance) to Dragon? Or are Fairy attacks merely Super Effective against Dragons?
2013-06-13T17:21:57-0700,According to the leak yes linkhttp://pokebeach.com/2013/05/supposed-pokemon-x-and-y-insider-informationSo it is unsure if dragon immunity is real or fake
2013-06-13T18:35:31-0700,"IMO, Fairy's effectiveness will ultimately depend on its immunities or resistances; for example, if it doesn't have either vs Dragon, I'd much rather have a Steel type still because something like Metagross can take Dragon attacks with impunity and still nab a 2HKO in good situations. Otherwise, what's the benefit of a SE Fairy attack on a Dragon when you can use your own Dragon to beat it in also? So guess we'll see if that rumor is true or not, otherwise just weakness to Poison and Steel isn't that bad. What I don't get is the fire resistance, kinda odd Fire Pokemon would randomly be resistant to Fariy.../shrug"
2013-06-13T18:51:02-0700,Fairy Type Attacks will be interesting to see what comes about.Attacks like Will-O-Wisp- a possibility that Fairy type couls recieve support in this area.It will be interesting to see what Pokemon will have access to any Fairy type attacks- this I can not wait to see what comes about in all of this. Like a TM?
2013-06-13T19:59:32-0700,"A couple of questions...I'm not really much of a competitive player -- play for fun -- but I do value competitive stats and whatnot versus other Pokemon in a game. With that said, I have a couple of questions.1) First, why did they make Dragon type so powerful in the first place, only to find a need to balance it out with the Fairy type? Seems silly on hindsight. *Shrug*2) Regarding a comment someone made on restoring the ""power creep"" in the game. How would you do that, besides maybe either lowering and/or increasing overall base stats? And wouldn't that upset people if, say, Dragonite's base stats dropped 50-100 points?I'm personally looking forward to seeing Fairy types, though, and hope that there are some nicely balanced, if not powerful Pokemon in that category. The second thing that piques my interest from the new information is the horde battle. One on five sounds awesome, unless your Pokemon isn't prepared, of course. Oh, and stepping on Pokemon...LOL."
2013-06-13T20:31:34-0700,"The first thing is Base Stats need to change. Some Pokemon have a base stat of 470 as a stage 2 Pokemon while other have 600. Yes some species of Pokemon are better then other and it should be that way but all Pokemon need a competitive edge. The way to do this is not by making attacks like Shell Smash. Balanced Base Stats should be the thing looked at and tied with the species the Pokemon is based on but animals have a competitive edge over others even though they may not be stronger.The idea is to balance out the stats so the competitive scene does not become about using the best or making a team of ""good stuff"". Since this is a new game, they have the change to fix this. Perhaps the Lati twins dont need a base stat total of 600, the same as other Pokemon like Metagross and other who also have very powerful movepools. Abilities also need to be unique to the Pokemon and be useful. Keen Eyes which is a ability on most bird Pokemon should mean their attacks always hit. Most abilities are useless in competitive play.If you remember, the ability Sturdy use to be where the Pokemon was unable to be hit my moves that KOed in 1 hit but not its changed to if a attack would KO them at full HP, they have one HP left, like Focus Sash. That ability is overpowered in competitive play. The game as of now fixed power creep with more power creep and it needs to stop. They have a fresh start for this so I hope they do this."
2013-06-13T22:03:20-0700,"Guess that would kind of line up with the example that I gave, in reducing Dragonite (and other pseudo-Legendaries). I would love to see more of my ""favorite"" Pokemon with better/balanced stats. In studying base stats rather extensively the last couple of months, there are few non-Legendaries that even break 100 in both Attack and Special Attack...for example. Of course, that may or may not be a focus to people in the more competitive circle. I don't like to zone in on Legendaries to make a great team...variety is nice.As for abilities, what you suggest would be nice...Heatran, for example, seems rather unique in ability as combined with stats. But there are many...most?...that I look at their abilities and gloss over them as being completely useless to my agenda. Maybe, with Pokemon like Reshiram and Zekrom...though part of their appeal are in their stats, it seems what makes them so cool are their ability to bypass Sturdy, etc. Heh, then again, is that power creeping the power creep still? A good marriage of the two (stats with ability) would go a long way to make more interesting Pokemon.Just my two cents. Oh, and I guess it was you who mentioned the power creep comment...finally found that post. (Just wanted to clarify ""credit"" as such.)"
2013-06-13T22:39:50-0700,"Another thing with abilities is to balance them. Why give a Pokemon with Dragon Dance the ability Moxie? I would like more Pokemon unique abilities and not those that change the flow of battle. Speed Boost needs to only go off once, not 6 times.As for the legendaries with abilities, they also need balance. Mold Breaker was hard to deal with but a pokemon with 670+ base stats with a ability that ignores everything is a bit OP."
2013-06-13T22:59:09-0700,"Your complaints are with a bunch of combinations that don't even see much play in tournaments. I can't remember the last time I saw a Scrafty use Dragon Dance or Moxie (ok maybe 2011). The most use Sturdy sees is LV1 Aron of all things. I don't think I've ever seen Shell Smash used by a competent player and nerfing Latias is the last thing that needs to be done...Benzo, the games will likely come out either around or after the first set of Regionals. Gen 5 will still almost certainly be used for the first regional of the new season.There was only one Dragon type in Gen 1 and no dragon attacks aside from Dragon Rage which always did a set 40. So when GSC came along, they didn't have anything to fix. That was the last time the type chart was changed. 4 generations later, enough has changed that they feel the type chart needs to be changed up a bit!"

You take away Draco Meteor from being a tutor move just about any can get and make it exclusive to the legendaries like Palkia and such (Outrage is more manageable, being unusable in doubles and easily switched out of in singles), add in another weakness and a couple of Pokemon that can resist Dragon other than Steel, and I think that could balance them out without having to throw in a new type to counter them and others like Dark."
2013-06-15T13:49:22-0700,"Like someone was mentioning over at Nugget Bridge, it'd actually be kinda nice if they just did away with IVs; then junk like certain sites where you can download Pokemon wouldn't have much purpose, it evens out the playing field a bit (as every Pokemon is basically a clean slate to just imprint EVs onto), and for Hidden Power, you can simply do away with it or make it like some stones you can click on to select a type for it (like how you can swap Rotom forms by going to the right appliance)."
2013-06-17T04:36:24-0700,"I mentioned this exact same IV idea over on beach, along with them blocking or simply not allowing transfer of mons from BW1&2 to not create a headache with the new mechanic. Most did not like the idea lol."
2013-06-17T11:43:28-0700,I'd like to see the removal of IVs as well. They dont do what they are suppose to do anymore with competitive players.
2013-06-18T16:56:08-0700,"Exactly, and with the loss of the IV mechanic, leaving just an EV mechanic in its place- with more visibility in the games- would level the playing field for newcomers and veterans (who have less than a stellar amount of time on hand to train, breed or even RNG).I had no problem RNGing in BW once I figured it out, and even though its much faster than breeding for that desired shiny with perfect stats, or a perfect legend, its still time consuming. Being an adult with a full time job, its very hard to find time to even use the Pokemon products I have loved for over a decade. With the advent of online tournaments the last couple years, this would increase my chances of jumping into the competitive scene (same goes for PTCGO as well though)."
2013-06-18T17:17:37-0700,"Having the IV's removed is a good idea. Allowing the base stats to determine the placement of EV's is IMO a better route to take. Breeding will be less pressuring. I think that over all- type should be the main factors in what weakness is verses the need for IV's to determine any advantage.Take 2 Pokemon that are the same: Charizard vs Charizard-You will need to place your EV's in the stats you are wanting to be ""advantage"" if you are looking to win a speed war for example. Isn't that what Nature and Personality is for?No two Pokémon are the same- yet the base stats are the same and having IV's be the factor to keeping them different is sort of contradicting IMO."
2013-06-19T10:16:28-0700,"There would need to be a system to not make all Pokemon the same but easier to maintain then IVs. Not many players know about IVs or EVs and have no real chance to compete with the likes of those who do. Still the advanced players need a learning curve to get over but since the internet and competitive play, the IV and EV system are out of date. Then again the turn based PvP system is out of date."
2013-06-19T16:37:45-0700,"Personally, I think the nature system should just be expanded to offset a removal of IVs. Example being: Malicious nature= Atk +5% Sp. Atk +5% Defense -10% or Courteous nature= +5%Def/Sp Def -10% Speed.If they added as many natures for every split positive combo and split negative combo, would would get a psuedo variety effect. While not as ""varied"" as having an IV determine 2 points for a stat at level 100, it certainly would give each Pokemon a more varied outcome than the current nature system alone.Just an idea, but Id really like to see IVs go the way of the buffalo.EDIT: Getting even more in depth- they could even add in +15 -15 natures to give even greater variety."
2013-06-19T19:30:19-0700,"^ ????It might just be me, I am not understanding what you are saying.Are you saying that Nature and personality will effect base stats in replacement of the IV system?Or, that the base stats are solid and the nature auto add/subtract's the difference from the max total from the base stat +/- 15 ?Example:Base stat attack is say 100. Total stat count (without any EV's added) is say 200. EV'd would be 300So, if modest nature, the attack stat is - 15 per 100 count? So a modest nature would total 255 max? If you wanted to add in EV's, it would still not hit max of 300.Or, am I just way off on what you are saying?"
2013-06-20T04:47:37-0700,"Sorry, I was probably a bit tired when I wrote that- so it may seem garbled and hard to understand.Currently, the nature system gives bonuses and deductions to certain stats. We only have 24 natures available at this time, but Im suggesting adding more with more varied differences in the stat increases and decreases.So currently, there are 4 natures that do nothing such as Docile, while there are 4 natures that boost attack, defense, sp atk, sp def, and speed respectively, while lowering one of those 5 specific stats depending on the nature.The amount that the current natures raise a stat is 10%, while the one each nature lowers is lowered by 10%. So, each nature modifies 2 base stats of a Pokemon using a 10% exchange.If they added in, say, 20 MORE natures to the mix, we could see much more varying stat exchanges, which would keep each Pokemon's uniqueness to some degree, and offer a simpler alternative to IVs.My examples were- instead of keeping just the 10% exchange rate, they could make natures that have an exchange rate of 15%, so lowering 3 stats by 5% and raising 1 by 15%. OR lowering a stat by 5% and one by 10% and raising 3 other stats by 5%.Im not sure if I explained it better this time or not, but hopefully you get what Im saying. This is just how I think the nature system could be expanded to somewhat replace the variance that IVs have given us."
2013-06-20T12:48:09-0700,"^ Now that I understand, lol. I think I was a bit on the tired side myself.Adding in more natures would be nice to toss into the pool of available stat +/- side of things vs relying on IV's.The thing with IV's is that from a 0-31 ""random"" (which is not) the odds of getting a great/excellent Pokémon is too much in favor of the weaker side. And tossing in the Natures, this adds into more of the weaker side.Having a zero IV in attack on an adamant nature is crud in it's own, but this is worse:31 IV in special attack, zero IV in attack, adamant nature.Now, breeding with all the breeding mechanics and getting this as a result without having to jump through a lengthy process, with the female dream world ability, - I could go on-without knowing how to rng- your looking at the IV system as being more of a hindering and time consuming knowing that you will have a greater chance at having a Pokémon that still sits on the lower end of the ""excellent"" side of the line due to IV's."
2013-06-20T14:19:47-0700,I would also like some kind of in game way to change a Pokemons ability when you want. You could do this in Pokemon Conquest so I would like to see it return. Would also help me not breed different Pokemon for abilities.
2013-06-21T00:15:59-0700,"^That would be cool- but I highly doubt that will be a new feature. In the competitive side of abilities, there are only so many that are worth it for battle use.

Perhaps to golden, so breeding mechs will still be the same I am afraid to say.What about triple and rotation battles? Anything other then double battles is rather bleh for the competitive scene. Air battles, under water battles maybe?I think that if they are going to spice things up a little, I think environments being a bit more interactive would be sort of cool.

What do you guys think?"
2013-06-21T07:37:07-0700,"IMO, and this is just how I play (in the non-competitive environment), I like power stats -- Attack, Special Attack.

2013-05-11T07:55:08-0700,"Serebii has just posted two pages from a CoroCoro article with more information on Pokemon X & Y, revealing four new Pokemon:Gogoat, riding Pokemon, Grass Type, 1.7m, 91.0kg.Elikiteru, Electric or normal Type, new move: Barabora ChargeYayakoma, Japanese Robin Pokemon, Normal/Flying Type, 0.3m, 1.7kg.Yancham, Naughty Pokemon, Fighting Type, 0.6m, 8.0kg, new move: Parting RemarkThe two pages also revealed the name of the new region is the Karos Region, the main city of the region is Miare City, you can change the skin and the hair color of your character and that you can ride certain Pokemon, including Gogoat around in the game, probably instead of a bicycle! I think that you can only change your hair and skin color at the start of the game but unlock trainer customization items as you go on. From the picture of the region, the region kind of looks star shaped. There is also a guy that looks similar to N on the second page. I think that he's your rival as they some pics of you meeting him in random areas. Pokemon also reveal two different move sets of Chespin but since they're not translated, it's unknown whether or not Chespin has a new move. OK, this is all the information revealed at the moment.Just remember that these are the Japanese names so, Gogoat, Elikiteru, Yayakoma, Yancham, Karos and Miare are probably not going to be in the English versions."

2013-05-11T09:22:01-0700,I think Zoroark was a werewolf on transformation steroids.
2013-05-11T09:51:07-0700,Guys. Did you see the new player characters??Guys.The girl is so freakin adorable.And these SCREENSHOTS. And. And.Oh my god I'm so excited.
2013-05-11T11:35:30-0700,"I like the character designs but... I wish they weren't all chibified in the game :/ There's no reason for that anymore, Coliseum was the nicest looking game as far as humans were concerned."
2013-05-11T12:07:34-0700,The lizard stands out a bit to me but that's only cause his colour scheme is similar to Shieldon or someone. Hopefully the Panda can evolve into something giant!
2013-05-11T12:11:11-0700,"I agree, wish they weren't chibified to the extent they are, but still, gotta remember it's really a kid's game :lol:But yeah, I like that you can actually ride Pokemon now! Wonder if it'll be retroactive for other older candidates, like Ponyta/Rapidash and such. And a fighting type panda sounds fun, even if it'll just spawn endless jokes about kung fu panda...The customization for the Trainer is a nice touch as well, even if it looks kinda limited. Nice to have some instead of none at all."
2013-05-11T12:13:11-0700,"I'm definitively happy with the character designs, though the boy sorta just looks like the character from BW with a new hairdo.The new Pokemon are interesting.I really like the birdie, hopefully it would evolve into something ugly.The panda is cute, mischievous, and I like him.The goat will take some getting used to, but he's not that bad.I'm not sure about the lizard, however. It looks sorta like Mawile on four legs...."
2013-05-11T14:48:33-0700,"hmmmmmm- riding a Pokemon- possible races in the game?I wonder if FLY will be FP like you control the flying, and surf will cool in FP as well.Navigating the region would be shweet if this is a step forward to travel mechanics."
2013-05-11T14:52:55-0700,At first when I put this thread up I also thought that Elikiteru looked like a prevolution of Mawile then I looked back at the picture of it in gameplay and it did look like an electric type. (This is before they revealed the name and type of it).There probably will be Pokemon races as that would make a lot of sense. I don't think that their going to show any animations during flight as would probably take up to much data space in the game just for flight animations and also people like how flying is so quick as they don't have to waste time. Surfing in FP would be new but it probably never happen as most people like being able to see around them. FP in the games is like having tunnel vision. Also I noticed that the Pokemon the main characters were riding had a saddle so you probably have to get the saddle before riding your Pokemon.
2013-05-11T15:49:02-0700,"I was actually just thinking about player controlled flying... and it would be beautiful! Being able to see the region from the sky would be amazing. I was thinking of it sort of like this... as the short animation of the Pokemon grabbing you to fly takes place, the touch screen gives you the option to fly manually. If you dont press it before the animation is over, the flying ends like any other game. If you do press it, then you get control of the Pokemon. You could fly around and when you are at your destination, the touch screen would display a land option. As for places you haven't been to.... I was thinking either you dont have a land option, or your player does a backflip turn around if it goes to far similar to the Spyro flying levels for Playstation."
2013-05-11T16:12:32-0700,"Heh, this is only the second set of games where I prefer the male player character's design to the female's. (I much prefer Ethan to Lyra, it's a closer contest here, though. Also, Red/Leaf and Gold/Crystal are pretty even.)Heh, as for the Pokemon... The robin looks promising design-wise. (It doesn't look anything special in this stage, but it will look good when it evolves, it's only its traits as a young bird that make it not look really good.) Not a fan of the other ones, though the goat will probably be a good Pokemon. Electric/Normal is a very odd typing... It's making me wonder if they'll change the type matchups a little, since Electric and Normal aren't a very useful combination, and it really offers nothing but extra weaknesses, a mostly useless Ghost immunity and only a marginally useful Electric resistance. Not the first time I've thought they'd change the type relations this generation, though."
2013-05-11T17:18:05-0700,I think it would be fun if they allowed you to also ride some of the older gen Pokemon. Running across fields riding on a Rapidash would be fun.
2013-05-11T22:39:23-0700,I wouldnt mind riding an electrode...
2013-05-11T23:31:17-0700,"AgreedI really like the character designs, and I like that you can customize the hair/skin color. Things are really looking awesome, can't wait for the next info."
2013-05-11T23:31:42-0700,"Has anyone else seen what Pokebeach posted a while ago? They posted an article explaining that Hiro claims he has insider information and that he seems to be predicting the new details quite accurately, like he said that there was going to be an Electric Typed draining move back in Feburary, three months before it was revealed! Here is some of the information that person revealed back in Feburary:Fairy will be a new type. It is weak to Poison and Steel, immune to Dragon, super effective against Dragon, Dark, Fighting and Fire and Psychic take half damage from it.Sylveon is Fairy Type. Some older Pokemon will be reclassified to Fairy, such as Mawile (Steel/Fairy)Mewtwo has two new formes, not just one. Both are activated via items.The professor's English name is Patrice.The Starter final evolutions are Fire/Psychic, Grass/Fighting and Water/DarkThe first Gym is Bug, the second is Fairy and the fourth is FightingA few attacks will be dual-typedThere will be a new type of battling style that Flying Type Pokemon and Pokemon with Levitate can participate in.You will be able to see a Pokemon's EVs at a certain in-game facility. You will be able to boost the EVs through mini games. It will take about two hours to get one stat to Max EVs.This information is amazing! Sure, this could all be fake BUT Hiro has already proven that there was an Electric Type draining move and he released many Black and White Pokemon in April 2011 before the games came out. I could be getting my hopes up for nothing but it seems likely that this information is correct. Hiro has also revealed several English Pokemon names for X & Y put Pokebeach won't post them until something more substantial than an attack effect is proven. I really hope that this is all real because it seems so exciting! Also, another thing going for the information is this: The filename for Mewtwo's new forme on the official Pokemon movie website ishttp://www.pokemon-movie.jp/img/pokemon/long/info/infoM2x.png. M2X could mean Mewtwo X forme, so maybe there's a Mewtwo Y?"
2013-05-12T01:17:55-0700,I really do hope that bird looks better as it evolves. Its basic form looks way to plain. I also hope they dont get rid of the EV and IV systems. They need to release more information about the game.
2013-05-12T04:01:17-0700,"I too, hope that the bird's evolutions look better but where did the idea of them getting rid of EV and IV systems come from? Also, yes they need to release more information on the games but they're got 5 months to do so, so they can take their time but I anxious to hear more about Pokemon X & Y."
2013-05-12T05:16:24-0700,"I wish they'd just announce the fairy type. Or light, whatever its gonna be called."
2013-05-12T05:45:24-0700,"You didn't read the other comment about how Pokebeach knew of Barabora Charge three months ago, did you?"
2013-05-12T06:56:36-0700,"By the same merit, Sylveon was hinted to be strong against Ice on Smash yesterday, which the leak makes no mention of. It's probably best to just take it with a grain of salt for now and focus on what's confirmed."
2013-05-12T12:15:53-0700,"I'm really happy for there finally being a Panda Pokemon. Panda, Ant, Peacock and a good Dolphin Pokemon are things i've wanted since Gen 1, and now with Durant and this new Panda, they are half way there!I really don't like the new bird, but the other two are cool too. Best Pokemon reveals since the starters!"
2013-05-12T12:31:59-0700,Spinda. Spinda is a panda
2013-05-12T14:48:31-0700,"It depends on who you ask. Some people think it's actually a Red Panda, which has nothing to do with normal pandas. (red pandas have a bizarre habit offalling over for no reasonwhich Spina looks like he's constantly about to do)"
2013-05-12T15:12:45-0700,They all have satanic eyes.
2013-05-12T16:39:59-0700,"I know the information is to be taken with a grain of salt but this has a lot more backing it up than a hint of Sylveon being strong against ice.1. Hiro announced this all the way back in February, when they had barley shown Sylveon, the three starters and the two main legendaries. They hadn't even revealed Mewtwo's new forme and yet Hiro knew that there was going to be a two new formes before this.2.How could this is information be false? No one could of come up with this as soon as the games were revealed .3.Also back in Feburary, he hinted at a new Electric move that drains your opponent's HP and heals your own. He hinted at Barabora Charge, three months early!4. Back in April 2011, Hiro revealed many Black & White Pokemon before they were revealed so this makes his information quite reliable.5.I'm not sure this counts as it wasn't revealed by Hiro but it does back up his information. The website address for Mewtwo's new forme on the official Pokemon site ishttp://www.pokemon-movie.jp/img/poke...fo/infoM2x.pngwhile the website address for the original Mewtwo is infoM2.png. They added an x to the file name obviously on purpose.In summary, this information could very well be fake but all this information seems very likely to be true as he has already revealed many Black & White Pokemon back in April 2011. I, for one, would be extremely upset and surprised if this was a hoax. The information Hiro has given so far has been way too accurate to be a hoax.P.S. The only thing backing up the fact that Sylveon could be effective against ice is that it was hinted on Pokemon Smash. I prefer more than one fact backing up information."
2013-05-12T18:23:13-0700,This video makes me like Spinda so much more now lolSent from my SGH-T769 using Tapatalk 2
2013-05-13T03:13:34-0700,What video do you mean because I don't see a link to a video?
2013-05-13T07:00:40-0700,"Looks like the characters wear their pokeballs in some sort of bangle on their wrist. Nothing too startling in that I guess, but I suppose it would leave more room in their bags."
2013-05-13T09:40:25-0700,"So... years ago, Yu-Gi-Oh spoofs Pikachu with the card/character.Now Pokémon has an electric lizard.That is just awesome."
2013-05-13T13:06:47-0700,"Serebii now has more information on the game. It appears that the Karos Pokedex is separated into three different areas, the Central Karos Pokedex, the Coastal Karos Pokedex and the Mountains Karos Pokedex."
2013-05-13T17:23:49-0700,"I also wonder about the significance of the character's glasses. It may have no significance, but both male and female character are wearing them.Edit: and what is that thing under Ash's chin, and the other characters (or potential pokemon) near Mewtwo's head?"
2013-05-13T19:09:02-0700,"[DEL]If they make mawile a fairy type...[/DEL]Let's just say, if they do... I won't be happy."
2013-05-13T20:17:54-0700,Why not? I used to hate the idea of a new type but now I'll be happy if the type is exactly like Hiro described and I think reclassifying some Pokemon into fairy types will even up the format.
2013-05-13T20:43:42-0700,"Yes it would be nice to have a new type, however Mawile of all pokemon?When I think of fairies, I totally do not think of giant teeth gnashing at me."
2013-05-13T21:03:19-0700,"Mawile's origin stems from some sort of Japanese folklore I believe. I dont know much about it, but what its based of could very well fall under the traditional fairy category. Fairies can be evil and gross looking. Its actually a less restricting type than Bug or DragonEdit: A fairy can be a changeling too! Wouldnt that be a cool Pokemon?? Sure we have Ditto, but that is more of genetic based thing. We also have Zoroark, but that is more of an illusion than anything. Idk... maybe it would just be redundant then lol"
2013-05-14T04:22:32-0700,"Mawile's origin is the futakuchi-onna, who is a Japanese youkai (monster/demon) who has another mouth on the back of her head."
2013-05-14T05:29:32-0700,"It's not up to us to guess what Pokemon will be reclassified to Fairy Type but we'll probably grow to like them as we play with them. Just thinking of Mawile being Fairy/Steel, wouldn't it's type chart look something like this:Normal: x 0.5Fire: x 2Water: x 1Grass: x 0.5Electric: x 1Ice: x 0.5Fighting: x 2Poison: x 0Ground: x 2Flying: x 0.5Psychic: x 0.5Bug: x 0.5Rock: x 0.5Ghost: x 0.5Dragon: x 0Dark: x 0.5Steel: x 1Fairy: x 1Looking at this, Mawile now only has three weaknesses, same as Metagross! Mawile is also immune to Dragon as well as Poison. The only thing that makes this irrelevant is the lack of stats for Mawile."
2013-05-14T08:00:21-0700,"I've always liked MawileOh, and btw, it looks like the rumors are most likely true. Pokebeach posted the supposed names of the 4 Pokemon that were revealed and they were confirmed this morning. They got the names from the same source that told them about Fairy. So its even more of a stretch if Fairy type is false."
2013-05-14T09:47:18-0700,"So far, I still love Fennekin (for obvious reasons :biggrin. I really hope it does evolve into an epic Fire/Psychic type. Anything but Fire/Fighting :nonono:I actually really like Gogoat. For one thing, it is a Grass type, so there's Fennekin's Water counter. Another thing is you can ride it around town (it must be pretty big compared to the main character), it learns Horn Leech one of my favorite moves, and it just looks cool. If it's stats are right this could be one of my main Party members.I'm indifferent on the other new Pokemon. Fletchling seems legit though. It's simple yet cool and i like that it can learn Flame Charge. Makes for a decent counter move against Ice-types.On to the game itslef, the player character designs are awesome (not sure about the shades). I like how there is some degree of customization. I actually don't mind the chibi sprites; it has a nice anime feel to it. The 3D visuals look stunning (especially my adorable Fennekin :biggrin. Navigation is no longer left to right according to the sreenshots as you are apparently now able to move diagonally. This seems like a small change but it's actually a large improvement IMO. And i like the differing modes of transportation.This is such a leap foward for pokemon fans and the game itself. Needlessly to say ""I am SOOO gonna buy this game."""
2013-05-14T14:07:51-0700,"I can't seem to find the thread where I read this, so I guess just take this as a rumor or theory, but I read about there being bigger differences between the two version of X and Y. Like you take different routes, therefor facing gym leaders in different order. Like in one version you will take a mountain route first and in the second version you take the coastal route first. Anybody else read this somewhere? I think it sounds interesting and I would love for them to make bigger differences between the two versions to provide newer experiences.http://www.serebii.net/xy/46.jpgYou can see from that Pokedex image that each ""region"" of the pokedex has a symbol. The coastal section is blue, so I'm guessing that's for Pokemon X. The mountain section is red, so I'm guessing that's for Pokemon Y"
2013-05-14T14:49:04-0700,"Well, personally I didn't read that myself, but I would certainly appreciate the games more if that was the case. Instead of buying the opposite one from my son's choice, I'd buy both for myself, and he could put his money on whichever one he chose. I already have mine preordered, so I hope they ""officially"" announce that soon, so I can preorder the other one as well. If this isn't the case, then I obviously don't need to preorder it, but it's certainly a nice bit of gossip anyways."
2013-05-14T15:41:07-0700,It might be something like in BW where you could only go west until you beat E4. In this case it could be in X you go coastal until you beat E4 then head for the mountains and vice versa in Y.
2013-05-14T22:36:24-0700,"Looking at the region map, it looks like Pokemon has it's own version of Stonehenge to the left of Kalos, along with a mysterious, single island, surrounded by stones near the top left of the map. There also appears to be a strange structure underneath the mysterious island, which appears to be something like a safari or a farm. Also, in the small patch of desert, there appears to be a group of strange, technological structures, one of which (the one near the magma), looks like the one from the first trailer. To the right of the Lumiose City in the center, the seems to be an old castle with a weird pedestal out the front. To the upper right of the Lumiose City, there is a small, white sort of building but is too small to tell what it is. Also, just below the castle, the appears to be a cave and yet another pedestal. To the right of the castle, there is what appears to be a cycling path. Can anyone figure out what these are for?Anyways, I think that the starting town is either north of the region in the town in the star shaped mountain area or is the town near the coast, south-west of the main city, near the weird stonehenge-looking thing. I think the most likely would be the town near the coast as it seems traditional for Pokemon to start you off in a town with grass to battle and catch Pokemon and besides, in one of the pictures on Pokebeach, it showed a wild Fletchling at Lv 2, being battled.Another thing I noticed is that in the Pokemon summary box picture of Chespin, Froakie and Fennekin, it showed that on the next page had ribbons. This could either mean that they are reintroducing Pokemon contests or something like them that earn you ribbons or that they've just done that because event Pokemon have ribbons.I think I found something on the region map that appears to be the doing of the evil team in the Kalos region. To the immediate right of Lumiose City, there is a giant, purple crystal. I also think that the technological buildings near that patch of desert also have something to do with the evil team.Looking back to the first X & Y trailer, remember the showed Yveltal being in the clouds while Xerneas was in front of a giant, hollow tree. Well Yveltal might be in the giant ice mountain as that has heaps of clouds over it and seems like the place to put a legendary Pokemon while Xerneas is possibly found near the giant tree, in the forest under the castle.Here are some random things I've noticed about the map:To the south-west of Lumiose City, there appears to be a place to grow something, possibly a farm.To the south of Lumiose City, what looks a giant performance area is there. Also, in front of it appears to be palm trees.There is two forest islands just underneath that mysterious island.Well that all I can find on the map, I hope some of these are revealed soon.North of Stonehenge, there's a place that kind of looks like it would be the perfect place for the fairy Gym (remember, we might as well call Hiro's information real as he's proven a lot already).I looked back at the first trailer and saw three gym areas, Psychic, Bug and Fire and going off Hiro's information about what gyms there are, here are a few of the gyms in the game:01: Bug02: Fairy??: Fire04: Fighting??: PsychicClose to Lumiose City, there's a place that looks like Kanto's route 12.To the east of Stonehenge, there is what appears to be a Pokemon Daycare.Near the cloudy Mountain, there's a town with a Windmill with a snow flake design that would be perfect for an ice gym.Just above the purple crystal, there's a mine with rail cart tracks.Well, that's all I can find on the map at the moment and I really hope someone replies on this thread as this thread is getting boring now."
2013-05-15T20:51:11-0700,"All I have to say why did they name the goat 'Gogoat'? Seriously, its like 'Go-cart' with 'goat' instead of 'cart'. *Snort* Its rather amusing to think about."
2013-05-15T21:38:03-0700,I think they named it that because you can ride it and it's a goat. What would have named it?
2013-05-16T05:47:17-0700,Why Goatout in a Canadian accent of course.
2013-05-16T09:37:21-0700,Huh? IDGI. Must be an American thing.
2013-05-16T11:40:56-0700,"Yeah, it is one of those American stereotypes.I think with each new generation of Canadian, the accent is losing itself, and could be gone forever."
2013-05-16T13:19:24-0700,"If it is an ""American"" thing, this Iowan living in South Dakota doesn't get it. :lol:"
2013-05-16T17:10:57-0700,Is anyone wondering what the Stonehenge structure might be for or anything like that?
2013-05-16T17:20:51-0700,"Yeah, I don't mean any offense of course, but as a Canadian, I really have no idea what he's talking about. Maybe that makes it funny for him .... hey, who knows? eh? Maybe it needs a bit more maple syrup eh, and Mounties eh, then it'll be hilarious."
2013-05-16T18:58:18-0700,Hes referring the the stereotype of canadians pronouncing OUT as OAT.
2013-05-16T20:25:57-0700,"Ah. Must be some sort of maritime accent then. Ok I guess. Kinda silly to call that a ""Canadian accent"" any more than a Texan's drawl or a Bronx accent as an ""American accent"", but hey, what do I know? Y'all might wanna know I'm from Ontario where there's no discernible accent. That's probably why I didn't get it. I guess that's why they call it a stereotype - cuz it's stupid and invariably wrong."
2013-05-16T21:42:50-0700,"I'm thinking the accent is from first generation Canadians. I still hear some people in Canada have that accent, especially aboriginal people, and they live in Manitoba. It isn't a Maritime thing, but more spread across the country. I'm thinking this accent isn't as prevalent in metropolitan areas, but it is most prevalent if your great or maybe great great grandparent was a Canadian.Here is Russel Peters take on the Canadian Accent... after him talking about the Indian accent.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uogdn7zWDmYIf you live in places like Toronto, you won't hear the accent. The place has been too Americanized. It's more in the Prairies, northern Ontario, and parts of Alberta.Newfies have their own accent distinct fromCanadian accent.In the end, some Canadians have it, some don't, and some don't realize they have it, and to Americans, the largest Canadian accent stereotype is the eh, and the oat instead of out."
2013-05-16T21:44:31-0700,Aaand how did we get on this topic?
2013-05-17T01:05:54-0700,"I think someone brought up the Canadian name for Gogoat. Also, what do people think that Stonehenge place is for?"
2013-05-17T02:18:16-0700,"^Possible ruins, maybe they decided to give the Regi's new forms or added a new Regi to the mix?Maybe the Unown make a comeback- I thought it was cool to be able to custom-build the Pokeballs............Ribbons reterning would be nice- I have an Absol with 47(?) ribbons on it- it would be shweet to stack more on it.I personally woould love to see growing/buying all the berries to make it's way back. Like, you have a garden beside your house- or secret base.Also what I am hoping is that download content will be something along the lines of opening up areas to the map. Accessing the areas after defeating the E4 is nothing new, it does add more to the play value after reaching the main story line and becomming the champ and all- but I think expanding the down load content like how it is for the Explorer/Dungeon games would really be a nice change."
2013-05-17T03:20:48-0700,"For me, I kinda liked the Pokémon Conquest type of crossover, so if they have download content I think it might be cool to try something like that, or perhaps some Donkey Kong Country Returns type crossover (navigation through the trees). When they introduced Dive, and added content under water, it seemed to open up more possibilities of movement in the games, so they need content to showcase the 3D environment, and 3D movement - possibly with a move like ""Jump."""
2013-05-17T14:06:45-0700,"So having had this explained...Why would you want to call it something pronounced ""Goatoat"". Plus, isn't it part Grass-Type? Goatoat might actually make a little sense..."
2013-05-17T19:48:54-0700,Has anyone revealed the 5th new pokemon?
2013-05-17T20:04:18-0700,"I'll go ahead and say no, since I haven't heard or seen any mention of one. However there's apparently something big going down on Pokemon Smash on Sunday."
2013-05-17T20:19:08-0700,Look in the background of this image.
2013-05-17T20:29:14-0700,No one's really acknowledged it as an actual Pokemon since it's pretty hard to tell what exactly it is. (It could be a decoration modeled after a Pokemon for all we know after all)
2013-05-17T20:35:17-0700,From speculation it is a pre-evolved form of Gogoat
2013-05-17T20:35:22-0700,"Good catch there, Trader. Yeah, to me it looks kinda like a couple fairly large guinea pig type pokemon that are green, grey and beige looking. Hard to make out of course since blowing the picture up only makes it more pixelated, but definitely worth a look.Edit: yeah, looking at it again, I could see those as a pre-evolution to Gogoat, especially since they are very similar in coloring."
2013-05-17T20:42:16-0700,"It's in the video too, isn't it?Maybe on that you can get a closer look...Though I can't take all the credit, someone on another pokemon community showed it to me."
2013-05-17T20:55:37-0700,"I think the Stonehenge place might be a Legendary's place, like Lake Verity with Mesprit or, remember how Junichi Masuda said back in Feburary 21st, that the games would take full advantage of the 3DS hardware, I'm hoping that Stonehenge place is like Outrealm Gate in Fire Emblem Awakening, where you can buy DLC packs. If you can buy new side stories and new places for X & Y that would be awesome. Also, if the Unown are in X & Y, they're most probably on that mysterious island off the coast near that town with the light house.P.S. I just had a thought. What if the Stonehenge place is like the Burnt Tower in Ecruteak City, where you encounter a trio of legendary Pokemon before they disband."
2013-05-18T01:21:41-0700,I read somewhere it could possibly be the place where you encounter Xerneas
2013-05-18T04:08:49-0700,"Look on the Kalos Region map, south of the castle with the pedestal, you'll see a forest and at the end of that forest, you see a giant tree. Also remember that in the very first X & Y trailer, Xerneas is shown standing in front of a giant tree, not giant stones and besides, that is way too close to a possible starting town."
2013-05-18T04:14:50-0700,"Who knows at this point to be honest though. In previous games the legendary appears at a location integral to the plot (which this stonehedge location could be), but since these legendaries seem to be different in origins as opposed to some previous legendaries we may see different locations for them like we did with Ho-oh and Lugia."
2013-05-18T07:39:39-0700,"But remember, that in the official trailer for HGSS, they showed Lugia and Ho-oh appearing in their respective areas and they did something similar for X & Y's official trailer as they have Yveltal in the clouds and Xerneas in front of a giant tree. To me, the only big tree I can see on this map is the one I saw south of the castle in the forest and besides, tell me one Pokemon game that has a main Legendary so close to a starting town (I'm a bit sick of calling it a possible starting town as it looks like they only town that would fit a description of a starting town)."
2013-05-18T07:54:52-0700,"I don't deny that, what I'm merely saying is that precedent says they should appear in the same place, but the presentation of the legends implies that they may not be.A personal theory of mine is that the three legendaries (assuming there will be a third) will also represent the three sections of the Pokedex, Xerneas: Main, Yveltal: Mountain, and Z: Ocean."
2013-05-18T15:18:36-0700,"Pokebeach has now just posted the last of the insider information and here it is:Pancham evolves into Pangoro in the early level 30s. In order to evolve Pancham into Pangoro, you need to have one other Dark-type in your party. Pangoro's type is Fighting/Dark.A Pokemon named Inkay evolves into Malimar. To evolve it, you have to hold your 3DS upside down when it levels up (the 3DS has an accelerometer and gyroscope, so it can detect that.) Malimar's type is Dark/Psychic.A Psychic typed Pokemon named Espurr evolves into Meowstick.Like in B/W, you have two rivals - one is friendly and the other is competitive. Your rival that is more friendly, gives you his/her fully evolved starter Pokemon after you beat the game.Another professor named Sycamore gives you either Bulbasaur, Charmander or Squirtle.Even though it shows the player riding around on a Gogoat in the new trailer, players can't ride on their own Pokemon. What was shown is just an alternate way of getting around Lumiose City and it only works with Gogoat.HMs still exist but there's a lot less of them.A new move, Belch, is a Poison-type attack that has a base power of 120. The user must consume a held berry to preform it.Draining Kiss is a Fairy-type attack that heals the user for the same amount of damage preformed. It has a base power of 60.The second forme of Mewtwo is to look roughly/vaguely similar to Mew.The correct types for the Starter's final evolutions is Fire/Psychic, Grass/Dark and Water/Fighting.This is the last of Hiro's insider information and since he has already predicted the names of four new Pokemon and what a new move did, three months ahead of being revealed, it would be stupid to take this information with a grain of salt anymore as it's most likely correct. I'm a bit disappointed in some of the information here such as Gogoat is the only Pokemon you can ride and you can only ride Gogoat in Lumiose City. Another piece of information has m extremely confused, the information about Espurr evolving into Meowstick. Sure, the names would make sense but the name Espurr looks Espeon and the name Meowstick looks like Meowth. The final part that I'm disappointed in is that Chespin's final evolution's type is Grass/Dark and Froakie's final evolution's type is Water/Fighting. I'm disappointed by this because I was really looking forward to getting a Grass/Fighting type starter Pokemon. OK, here the information and my opinion on it, now what's your opinion."
2013-05-19T06:56:30-0700,"My opinion is that it is all just speculation... Until I see actual proof, I'm taking it like a grain of salt.I read it and was like... ""cool"". That's about it..."
2013-05-19T11:58:35-0700,I'm waiting for the game to be fully released before I take anything as fact. I'm still looking around and cant find a official source that proves any of these claims.
2013-05-19T18:29:07-0700,"It's pretty stupid to think this all fiction, not fact as, Hiro, the guy who posted this has a lot backing up his information like:1: Hiro has already done this before. In April 2011, he revealed many Black & White Pokemon before they were revealed.2: Back in February, Hiro sent in this information. His information contained the four English names of the Pokemon they revealed this month and his information hinted at Parabolic Charge.3: It isIMPOSSIBLEto be able to precisely guess every single letter correctly of a four Pokemon that wouldn't be revealed for three months.Hiro keeps getting his information correct so it's completely stupid to call his information fake or fiction before it's proven as he is dead on with his information so you can consider it fake or fiction it's proven not to be true, which is extremely unlikely.The only thing going against his information is that it doesn't have an official source, but guess what? If his information had an official source then, we wouldn't know about this information so how about you stop judging his information until something is proven false as, so far, his information isvery reliable.Of course Hiro's information doesn't have an official source otherwise, everyone in the world would know about it and Pokemon would have it on their site."
2013-05-19T18:46:16-0700,"It needs to have a official source for this information. Perhaps someone at Creatures is giving him this information, if so, they may lose their jobs or he works for them. Until Pokemon comes out and say ""Yes, Fairy is a new type"" or other info Hiro is leaking, then it will be accepted.I take this news the same way I take the weather. If it rains, then I know they were right but weathermen have been wrong on many occasions."
2013-05-19T19:58:43-0700,"Actually, this guy isn't Hiro. He's the roommate of a guy who had a tester job at the American Gamefreak branch. That's why he keeps popping out English names. Gamefreak appearently managed to track him down the other day, so there won't be any further leaks from him.Pokebeach's first post on the subject makes it clear that he and Hiro are two completely different people."
2013-05-19T20:05:13-0700,"My only concern is...I know WPM is a legit source, but sometimes I doubt some of these ""sources"""
2013-05-23T20:09:38-0700,"Serebii has just posted that at E3, Nintendo will have a special Pokemon X & Y presentation/Q&A following their Nintendo Direct presentation. This presentation will run on June 11th at 6pm Pacific Time and will last 90 minutes. The presentation is run by Junichi Masuda and Tsunekazu Ishihara, the president of the Pokemon Company.I, myself, think that this presentation and Q&A will reveal a lot of information for Pokemon X & Y. I can't wait for the information to be revealed in the presentation as Pokemon X & Y information is pretty dry at the moment. What do you guys think of this?P.S. I posting this on this thread instead of making a new thread because this thread has been dying quite a bit after the last of the insider information was revealed."
2013-05-24T11:15:19-0700,"It is verychildishto boil every issue down to 100% for or 100% against. Even if the leak is genuine, we know miscommunication happens. Mistakes happen. The player base has more than once gotten worked up over, for example, bad fan translations, something that isn't even super-secret-privileged information.If you are mature, you takeallinformation with a grain of sale, even what you see! We live in a world where misinformation abounds, and none of us know all, see all, or understand all. Even what you see with your own eyes must be verified, because looks can be deceiving."
2013-05-24T13:56:15-0700,You do know that comment is almost a week old and that I don't care about it anymore.
2013-05-26T16:02:07-0700,"Then you probably shouldn't have posted it onto a message board in the first place; some people may not be able to rejoin a conversation for several days, or may wish to take some time before responding to give a more thoughtful answer.This is the internet; you words can last here for quite some time. :thumb:"
2013-05-26T19:01:18-0700,"As Otaku has implied, there is quite a difference between a forum and internet messaging. That's why you should always be willing to stand by your posts .... whether you think they are worth caring about or not. Learn to create and give out good posts and you'll never have anything to worry about when you're online.As for your earlier post, it is not stupid to think that some of that info from Hiro (or other sources) may be suspect. Just like me, and you ... he's not infallible."
2013-05-28T07:18:10-0700,"There is also a true sign of maturity and wisdom that is very rarely seen online; when you can come back to a comment you made and admit that you are wrong. Not because you just want to drop it or have been brow beaten into submission, but because someone has actually demonstrated it was wrong. This is something I struggle with, despite having entire CotD's over on Pojo where I had to eat crow."
2013-05-28T09:51:38-0700,"Wasnt this thread originally created to talk about the 4 new Pokemon that were revealed? Seems like its been a bit derailed for at least a page now...I personally love Pancham and Heloptiles designs, but I feel that Fletchling and Gogoat leave something to be desired in terms of design and naming."
2013-05-28T10:51:16-0700,"I just find Fletchling disappointing; like so many ""...this is the local version."" Pokémon, I'd prefer we actually got local variations of existing Pokémon instead of re-inventing the wheel. This could lead to alternate color schemes that aren't ""Shiny"" as well."
2013-05-28T11:14:16-0700,"I totally agree with you there. Really, the only way I can see Fletchling being redeemed as more than just another ""local version"" 'mon is if it gains the Fire type in place of Normal somwhere along its evolutionary line."
2013-05-28T11:22:30-0700,I would have liked it better if it were a Pidgey as they are suppose to be everywhere anyway. Its design is not that great IMO and it getting Flame charge is nothing that great as well. Just about every bird from the past gen got Heat Wave.I just hope its design gets stronger during its evolution.
2013-05-28T16:18:41-0700,"I'm simply going to note that this trend is also present in gen 1. (Lest we forget Fearow...although it seems many have)Plus most of the 'common birds,' have had very great differentiation from their bird cousins. Staraptor got Close Combat and great stats, and Swellow received similar treatment. Plus it isn't like there's great variety of normal birds in real life to begin with.It may be 'reinventing the wheel,' but there's more to the creation of a Pokemon than just its typing."
2013-05-28T17:15:23-0700,"Actually I have a soft place in my heart for Fearow; the fact that it is just another common ""Normal/Flying"" Type that fails to distinguish itself is on the designers heads, not the fans.These are video games; the only reason for Pokémon to be bland are they were designed that way. The reason many of us are complaining is that if we are lucky, a lot of these Pokémon only have purpose if they do have a good move pool or Ability... and then we get into the problem of how the rest of their ilk compete. Yes, there are some good examples amongst the Normal/Flying ""Bird"" Pokémon, but it is one of those numerous groups where it would be hard to make them all bland and forgettable.So again, instead of trying to find a way to make that Pokémon seem new, exciting, and different from the Pokémon in the previous game that filled the same niche role... just use the Pokémon from the previous game to fill the same niche roll, and give it a new paint job, Ability, or tweaked move list according to its new ""habitat""."
2013-05-28T17:24:02-0700,"But they're based off of real birds. Its not the designers fault that nature hasn't given them much to work with. Plus I kind of appreciate that all of the common birds aren't 'just pigeons,' and that we instead get birds of prey and nocturnal birds. Sure it doesn't do much for game design, but it does do wonders for world design. At least IMO."
2013-05-28T18:00:57-0700,"There is not a requirement that all real birds be adapted into the world of Pokémon as Normal/Flying-Types. It is a fantasy world, and even plausible within internal logic that some Pokémon could be more or less widespread that comparable real-world species.You know, I am fond of fantasy RPGs... and something that they have learned to do to make the worlds both more varied and more rich are things like applying local lenses to fantasy races. Of course, as I am talking about actual role-playing games (e.g. pencil-and-paper, not video games) there is more role-playing involved to actually make it relevant.Instead of giving me 650 Pokémon where maybe a third are memorable in the good way, a third are memorable in the bad way, and the rest blur together, I would rather we get more in depth with what actually exists. Even if the current model is followed, nothing forces them to be so restrictive with the typing. Why wasn't Noctowl a Dark/Flying-Type? The best reason I can think of is Murkrow was already coming out, in which case one or the other probably could have/should have been delayed until a later generation.Of course, that you like such things isfine. I am merely explaining part of why how things have been done don't reflect my own tastes."
2013-05-28T18:42:19-0700,"IMO expansion and enriching go hand in hand. As I said I appreciate the diversity of the common birds (and IMO they're all memorable in their own way) as it expands the world, and revisiting older Pokemon (ie. Cresselia's sidequest in BW2) is just as important.Part of the reason I love Pokemon is that it's so open to interpretation and available for different tastes to take advantage, and some of the birds cater to that. (Fletchling for example has become somewhat of a meme for instance)It's fine that it doesn't coincide with your personal approach to the franchise, it's difficult to satisfy everyone with anything, especially something like Pokemon with so many different creatures running around."
2013-05-11T07:55:08-0700,"Serebii has just posted two pages from a CoroCoro article with more information on Pokemon X & Y, revealing four new Pokemon:Gogoat, riding Pokemon, Grass Type, 1.7m, 91.0kg.Elikiteru, Electric or normal Type, new move: Barabora ChargeYayakoma, Japanese Robin Pokemon, Normal/Flying Type, 0.3m, 1.7kg.Yancham, Naughty Pokemon, Fighting Type, 0.6m, 8.0kg, new move: Parting RemarkThe two pages also revealed the name of the new region is the Karos Region, the main city of the region is Miare City, you can change the skin and the hair color of your character and that you can ride certain Pokemon, including Gogoat around in the game, probably instead of a bicycle! I think that you can only change your hair and skin color at the start of the game but unlock trainer customization items as you go on. From the picture of the region, the region kind of looks star shaped. There is also a guy that looks similar to N on the second page. I think that he's your rival as they some pics of you meeting him in random areas. Pokemon also reveal two different move sets of Chespin but since they're not translated, it's unknown whether or not Chespin has a new move. OK, this is all the information revealed at the moment.Just remember that these are the Japanese names so, Gogoat, Elikiteru, Yayakoma, Yancham, Karos and Miare are probably not going to be in the English versions."
2013-05-11T08:38:58-0700,Are we ever going to have a werewolf pokemon? They have dragons and unicorns and every other mythical animal but no weres
2013-05-11T09:22:01-0700,I think Zoroark was a werewolf on transformation steroids.
2013-05-11T09:51:07-0700,Guys. Did you see the new player characters??Guys.The girl is so freakin adorable.And these SCREENSHOTS. And. And.Oh my god I'm so excited.
2013-05-11T11:35:30-0700,"I like the character designs but... I wish they weren't all chibified in the game :/ There's no reason for that anymore, Coliseum was the nicest looking game as far as humans were concerned."
2013-05-11T12:07:34-0700,The lizard stands out a bit to me but that's only cause his colour scheme is similar to Shieldon or someone. Hopefully the Panda can evolve into something giant!
2013-05-11T12:11:11-0700,"I agree, wish they weren't chibified to the extent they are, but still, gotta remember it's really a kid's game :lol:But yeah, I like that you can actually ride Pokemon now! Wonder if it'll be retroactive for other older candidates, like Ponyta/Rapidash and such. And a fighting type panda sounds fun, even if it'll just spawn endless jokes about kung fu panda...The customization for the Trainer is a nice touch as well, even if it looks kinda limited. Nice to have some instead of none at all."
2013-05-11T12:13:11-0700,"I'm definitively happy with the character designs, though the boy sorta just looks like the character from BW with a new hairdo.The new Pokemon are interesting.I really like the birdie, hopefully it would evolve into something ugly.The panda is cute, mischievous, and I like him.The goat will take some getting used to, but he's not that bad.I'm not sure about the lizard, however. It looks sorta like Mawile on four legs...."
2013-05-11T14:48:33-0700,"hmmmmmm- riding a Pokemon- possible races in the game?I wonder if FLY will be FP like you control the flying, and surf will cool in FP as well.Navigating the region would be shweet if this is a step forward to travel mechanics."
2013-05-11T14:52:55-0700,At first when I put this thread up I also thought that Elikiteru looked like a prevolution of Mawile then I looked back at the picture of it in gameplay and it did look like an electric type. (This is before they revealed the name and type of it).There probably will be Pokemon races as that would make a lot of sense. I don't think that their going to show any animations during flight as would probably take up to much data space in the game just for flight animations and also people like how flying is so quick as they don't have to waste time. Surfing in FP would be new but it probably never happen as most people like being able to see around them. FP in the games is like having tunnel vision. Also I noticed that the Pokemon the main characters were riding had a saddle so you probably have to get the saddle before riding your Pokemon.
2013-05-11T15:49:02-0700,"I was actually just thinking about player controlled flying... and it would be beautiful! Being able to see the region from the sky would be amazing. I was thinking of it sort of like this... as the short animation of the Pokemon grabbing you to fly takes place, the touch screen gives you the option to fly manually. If you dont press it before the animation is over, the flying ends like any other game. If you do press it, then you get control of the Pokemon. You could fly around and when you are at your destination, the touch screen would display a land option. As for places you haven't been to.... I was thinking either you dont have a land option, or your player does a backflip turn around if it goes to far similar to the Spyro flying levels for Playstation."
2013-05-11T16:12:32-0700,"Heh, this is only the second set of games where I prefer the male player character's design to the female's. (I much prefer Ethan to Lyra, it's a closer contest here, though. Also, Red/Leaf and Gold/Crystal are pretty even.)Heh, as for the Pokemon... The robin looks promising design-wise. (It doesn't look anything special in this stage, but it will look good when it evolves, it's only its traits as a young bird that make it not look really good.) Not a fan of the other ones, though the goat will probably be a good Pokemon. Electric/Normal is a very odd typing... It's making me wonder if they'll change the type matchups a little, since Electric and Normal aren't a very useful combination, and it really offers nothing but extra weaknesses, a mostly useless Ghost immunity and only a marginally useful Electric resistance. Not the first time I've thought they'd change the type relations this generation, though."
2013-05-11T17:18:05-0700,I think it would be fun if they allowed you to also ride some of the older gen Pokemon. Running across fields riding on a Rapidash would be fun.
2013-05-11T22:39:23-0700,I wouldnt mind riding an electrode...
2013-05-11T23:31:17-0700,"AgreedI really like the character designs, and I like that you can customize the hair/skin color. Things are really looking awesome, can't wait for the next info."
2013-05-11T23:31:42-0700,"Has anyone else seen what Pokebeach posted a while ago? They posted an article explaining that Hiro claims he has insider information and that he seems to be predicting the new details quite accurately, like he said that there was going to be an Electric Typed draining move back in Feburary, three months before it was revealed! Here is some of the information that person revealed back in Feburary:Fairy will be a new type. It is weak to Poison and Steel, immune to Dragon, super effective against Dragon, Dark, Fighting and Fire and Psychic take half damage from it.Sylveon is Fairy Type. Some older Pokemon will be reclassified to Fairy, such as Mawile (Steel/Fairy)Mewtwo has two new formes, not just one. Both are activated via items.The professor's English name is Patrice.The Starter final evolutions are Fire/Psychic, Grass/Fighting and Water/DarkThe first Gym is Bug, the second is Fairy and the fourth is FightingA few attacks will be dual-typedThere will be a new type of battling style that Flying Type Pokemon and Pokemon with Levitate can participate in.You will be able to see a Pokemon's EVs at a certain in-game facility. You will be able to boost the EVs through mini games. It will take about two hours to get one stat to Max EVs.This information is amazing! Sure, this could all be fake BUT Hiro has already proven that there was an Electric Type draining move and he released many Black and White Pokemon in April 2011 before the games came out. I could be getting my hopes up for nothing but it seems likely that this information is correct. Hiro has also revealed several English Pokemon names for X & Y put Pokebeach won't post them until something more substantial than an attack effect is proven. I really hope that this is all real because it seems so exciting! Also, another thing going for the information is this: The filename for Mewtwo's new forme on the official Pokemon movie website ishttp://www.pokemon-movie.jp/img/pokemon/long/info/infoM2x.png. M2X could mean Mewtwo X forme, so maybe there's a Mewtwo Y?"
2013-05-12T01:17:55-0700,I really do hope that bird looks better as it evolves. Its basic form looks way to plain. I also hope they dont get rid of the EV and IV systems. They need to release more information about the game.
2013-05-12T04:01:17-0700,"I too, hope that the bird's evolutions look better but where did the idea of them getting rid of EV and IV systems come from? Also, yes they need to release more information on the games but they're got 5 months to do so, so they can take their time but I anxious to hear more about Pokemon X & Y."
2013-05-12T05:16:24-0700,"I wish they'd just announce the fairy type. Or light, whatever its gonna be called."
2013-05-12T05:45:24-0700,"You didn't read the other comment about how Pokebeach knew of Barabora Charge three months ago, did you?"
2013-05-12T06:56:36-0700,"By the same merit, Sylveon was hinted to be strong against Ice on Smash yesterday, which the leak makes no mention of. It's probably best to just take it with a grain of salt for now and focus on what's confirmed."
2013-05-12T12:15:53-0700,"I'm really happy for there finally being a Panda Pokemon. Panda, Ant, Peacock and a good Dolphin Pokemon are things i've wanted since Gen 1, and now with Durant and this new Panda, they are half way there!I really don't like the new bird, but the other two are cool too. Best Pokemon reveals since the starters!"
2013-05-12T12:31:59-0700,Spinda. Spinda is a panda
2013-05-12T14:48:31-0700,"It depends on who you ask. Some people think it's actually a Red Panda, which has nothing to do with normal pandas. (red pandas have a bizarre habit offalling over for no reasonwhich Spina looks like he's constantly about to do)"
2013-05-12T15:12:45-0700,They all have satanic eyes.
2013-05-12T16:39:59-0700,"I know the information is to be taken with a grain of salt but this has a lot more backing it up than a hint of Sylveon being strong against ice.1. Hiro announced this all the way back in February, when they had barley shown Sylveon, the three starters and the two main legendaries. They hadn't even revealed Mewtwo's new forme and yet Hiro knew that there was going to be a two new formes before this.2.How could this is information be false? No one could of come up with this as soon as the games were revealed .3.Also back in Feburary, he hinted at a new Electric move that drains your opponent's HP and heals your own. He hinted at Barabora Charge, three months early!4. Back in April 2011, Hiro revealed many Black & White Pokemon before they were revealed so this makes his information quite reliable.5.I'm not sure this counts as it wasn't revealed by Hiro but it does back up his information. The website address for Mewtwo's new forme on the official Pokemon site ishttp://www.pokemon-movie.jp/img/poke...fo/infoM2x.pngwhile the website address for the original Mewtwo is infoM2.png. They added an x to the file name obviously on purpose.In summary, this information could very well be fake but all this information seems very likely to be true as he has already revealed many Black & White Pokemon back in April 2011. I, for one, would be extremely upset and surprised if this was a hoax. The information Hiro has given so far has been way too accurate to be a hoax.P.S. The only thing backing up the fact that Sylveon could be effective against ice is that it was hinted on Pokemon Smash. I prefer more than one fact backing up information."
2013-05-12T18:23:13-0700,This video makes me like Spinda so much more now lolSent from my SGH-T769 using Tapatalk 2
2013-05-13T03:13:34-0700,What video do you mean because I don't see a link to a video?
2013-05-13T07:00:40-0700,"Looks like the characters wear their pokeballs in some sort of bangle on their wrist. Nothing too startling in that I guess, but I suppose it would leave more room in their bags."
2013-05-13T09:40:25-0700,"So... years ago, Yu-Gi-Oh spoofs Pikachu with the card/character.Now Pokémon has an electric lizard.That is just awesome."
2013-05-13T13:06:47-0700,"Serebii now has more information on the game. It appears that the Karos Pokedex is separated into three different areas, the Central Karos Pokedex, the Coastal Karos Pokedex and the Mountains Karos Pokedex."
2013-05-13T17:23:49-0700,"I also wonder about the significance of the character's glasses. It may have no significance, but both male and female character are wearing them.Edit: and what is that thing under Ash's chin, and the other characters (or potential pokemon) near Mewtwo's head?"
2013-05-13T19:09:02-0700,"[DEL]If they make mawile a fairy type...[/DEL]Let's just say, if they do... I won't be happy."
2013-05-13T20:17:54-0700,Why not? I used to hate the idea of a new type but now I'll be happy if the type is exactly like Hiro described and I think reclassifying some Pokemon into fairy types will even up the format.
2013-05-13T20:43:42-0700,"Yes it would be nice to have a new type, however Mawile of all pokemon?When I think of fairies, I totally do not think of giant teeth gnashing at me."
2013-05-13T21:03:19-0700,"Mawile's origin stems from some sort of Japanese folklore I believe. I dont know much about it, but what its based of could very well fall under the traditional fairy category. Fairies can be evil and gross looking. Its actually a less restricting type than Bug or DragonEdit: A fairy can be a changeling too! Wouldnt that be a cool Pokemon?? Sure we have Ditto, but that is more of genetic based thing. We also have Zoroark, but that is more of an illusion than anything. Idk... maybe it would just be redundant then lol"
2013-05-14T04:22:32-0700,"Mawile's origin is the futakuchi-onna, who is a Japanese youkai (monster/demon) who has another mouth on the back of her head."
2013-05-14T05:29:32-0700,"It's not up to us to guess what Pokemon will be reclassified to Fairy Type but we'll probably grow to like them as we play with them. Just thinking of Mawile being Fairy/Steel, wouldn't it's type chart look something like this:Normal: x 0.5Fire: x 2Water: x 1Grass: x 0.5Electric: x 1Ice: x 0.5Fighting: x 2Poison: x 0Ground: x 2Flying: x 0.5Psychic: x 0.5Bug: x 0.5Rock: x 0.5Ghost: x 0.5Dragon: x 0Dark: x 0.5Steel: x 1Fairy: x 1Looking at this, Mawile now only has three weaknesses, same as Metagross! Mawile is also immune to Dragon as well as Poison. The only thing that makes this irrelevant is the lack of stats for Mawile."
2013-05-14T08:00:21-0700,"I've always liked MawileOh, and btw, it looks like the rumors are most likely true. Pokebeach posted the supposed names of the 4 Pokemon that were revealed and they were confirmed this morning. They got the names from the same source that told them about Fairy. So its even more of a stretch if Fairy type is false."
2013-05-14T09:47:18-0700,"So far, I still love Fennekin (for obvious reasons :biggrin. I really hope it does evolve into an epic Fire/Psychic type. Anything but Fire/Fighting :nonono:I actually really like Gogoat. For one thing, it is a Grass type, so there's Fennekin's Water counter. Another thing is you can ride it around town (it must be pretty big compared to the main character), it learns Horn Leech one of my favorite moves, and it just looks cool. If it's stats are right this could be one of my main Party members.I'm indifferent on the other new Pokemon. Fletchling seems legit though. It's simple yet cool and i like that it can learn Flame Charge. Makes for a decent counter move against Ice-types.On to the game itslef, the player character designs are awesome (not sure about the shades). I like how there is some degree of customization. I actually don't mind the chibi sprites; it has a nice anime feel to it. The 3D visuals look stunning (especially my adorable Fennekin :biggrin. Navigation is no longer left to right according to the sreenshots as you are apparently now able to move diagonally. This seems like a small change but it's actually a large improvement IMO. And i like the differing modes of transportation.This is such a leap foward for pokemon fans and the game itself. Needlessly to say ""I am SOOO gonna buy this game."""
2013-05-14T14:07:51-0700,"I can't seem to find the thread where I read this, so I guess just take this as a rumor or theory, but I read about there being bigger differences between the two version of X and Y. Like you take different routes, therefor facing gym leaders in different order. Like in one version you will take a mountain route first and in the second version you take the coastal route first. Anybody else read this somewhere? I think it sounds interesting and I would love for them to make bigger differences between the two versions to provide newer experiences.http://www.serebii.net/xy/46.jpgYou can see from that Pokedex image that each ""region"" of the pokedex has a symbol. The coastal section is blue, so I'm guessing that's for Pokemon X. The mountain section is red, so I'm guessing that's for Pokemon Y"
2013-05-14T14:49:04-0700,"Well, personally I didn't read that myself, but I would certainly appreciate the games more if that was the case. Instead of buying the opposite one from my son's choice, I'd buy both for myself, and he could put his money on whichever one he chose. I already have mine preordered, so I hope they ""officially"" announce that soon, so I can preorder the other one as well. If this isn't the case, then I obviously don't need to preorder it, but it's certainly a nice bit of gossip anyways."
2013-05-14T15:41:07-0700,It might be something like in BW where you could only go west until you beat E4. In this case it could be in X you go coastal until you beat E4 then head for the mountains and vice versa in Y.
2013-05-14T22:36:24-0700,"Looking at the region map, it looks like Pokemon has it's own version of Stonehenge to the left of Kalos, along with a mysterious, single island, surrounded by stones near the top left of the map. There also appears to be a strange structure underneath the mysterious island, which appears to be something like a safari or a farm. Also, in the small patch of desert, there appears to be a group of strange, technological structures, one of which (the one near the magma), looks like the one from the first trailer. To the right of the Lumiose City in the center, the seems to be an old castle with a weird pedestal out the front. To the upper right of the Lumiose City, there is a small, white sort of building but is too small to tell what it is. Also, just below the castle, the appears to be a cave and yet another pedestal. To the right of the castle, there is what appears to be a cycling path. Can anyone figure out what these are for?Anyways, I think that the starting town is either north of the region in the town in the star shaped mountain area or is the town near the coast, south-west of the main city, near the weird stonehenge-looking thing. I think the most likely would be the town near the coast as it seems traditional for Pokemon to start you off in a town with grass to battle and catch Pokemon and besides, in one of the pictures on Pokebeach, it showed a wild Fletchling at Lv 2, being battled.Another thing I noticed is that in the Pokemon summary box picture of Chespin, Froakie and Fennekin, it showed that on the next page had ribbons. This could either mean that they are reintroducing Pokemon contests or something like them that earn you ribbons or that they've just done that because event Pokemon have ribbons.I think I found something on the region map that appears to be the doing of the evil team in the Kalos region. To the immediate right of Lumiose City, there is a giant, purple crystal. I also think that the technological buildings near that patch of desert also have something to do with the evil team.Looking back to the first X & Y trailer, remember the showed Yveltal being in the clouds while Xerneas was in front of a giant, hollow tree. Well Yveltal might be in the giant ice mountain as that has heaps of clouds over it and seems like the place to put a legendary Pokemon while Xerneas is possibly found near the giant tree, in the forest under the castle.Here are some random things I've noticed about the map:To the south-west of Lumiose City, there appears to be a place to grow something, possibly a farm.To the south of Lumiose City, what looks a giant performance area is there. Also, in front of it appears to be palm trees.There is two forest islands just underneath that mysterious island.Well that all I can find on the map, I hope some of these are revealed soon.North of Stonehenge, there's a place that kind of looks like it would be the perfect place for the fairy Gym (remember, we might as well call Hiro's information real as he's proven a lot already).I looked back at the first trailer and saw three gym areas, Psychic, Bug and Fire and going off Hiro's information about what gyms there are, here are a few of the gyms in the game:01: Bug02: Fairy??: Fire04: Fighting??: PsychicClose to Lumiose City, there's a place that looks like Kanto's route 12.To the east of Stonehenge, there is what appears to be a Pokemon Daycare.Near the cloudy Mountain, there's a town with a Windmill with a snow flake design that would be perfect for an ice gym.Just above the purple crystal, there's a mine with rail cart tracks.Well, that's all I can find on the map at the moment and I really hope someone replies on this thread as this thread is getting boring now."
2013-05-15T20:51:11-0700,"All I have to say why did they name the goat 'Gogoat'? Seriously, its like 'Go-cart' with 'goat' instead of 'cart'. *Snort* Its rather amusing to think about."
2013-05-15T21:38:03-0700,I think they named it that because you can ride it and it's a goat. What would have named it?
2013-05-16T05:47:17-0700,Why Goatout in a Canadian accent of course.
2013-05-16T09:37:21-0700,Huh? IDGI. Must be an American thing.
2013-05-16T11:40:56-0700,"Yeah, it is one of those American stereotypes.I think with each new generation of Canadian, the accent is losing itself, and could be gone forever."
2013-05-16T13:19:24-0700,"If it is an ""American"" thing, this Iowan living in South Dakota doesn't get it. :lol:"
2013-05-16T17:10:57-0700,Is anyone wondering what the Stonehenge structure might be for or anything like that?
2013-05-16T17:20:51-0700,"Yeah, I don't mean any offense of course, but as a Canadian, I really have no idea what he's talking about. Maybe that makes it funny for him .... hey, who knows? eh? Maybe it needs a bit more maple syrup eh, and Mounties eh, then it'll be hilarious."
2013-05-16T18:58:18-0700,Hes referring the the stereotype of canadians pronouncing OUT as OAT.
2013-05-16T20:25:57-0700,"Ah. Must be some sort of maritime accent then. Ok I guess. Kinda silly to call that a ""Canadian accent"" any more than a Texan's drawl or a Bronx accent as an ""American accent"", but hey, what do I know? Y'all might wanna know I'm from Ontario where there's no discernible accent. That's probably why I didn't get it. I guess that's why they call it a stereotype - cuz it's stupid and invariably wrong."
2013-05-16T21:42:50-0700,"I'm thinking the accent is from first generation Canadians. I still hear some people in Canada have that accent, especially aboriginal people, and they live in Manitoba. It isn't a Maritime thing, but more spread across the country. I'm thinking this accent isn't as prevalent in metropolitan areas, but it is most prevalent if your great or maybe great great grandparent was a Canadian.Here is Russel Peters take on the Canadian Accent... after him talking about the Indian accent.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uogdn7zWDmYIf you live in places like Toronto, you won't hear the accent. The place has been too Americanized. It's more in the Prairies, northern Ontario, and parts of Alberta.Newfies have their own accent distinct fromCanadian accent.In the end, some Canadians have it, some don't, and some don't realize they have it, and to Americans, the largest Canadian accent stereotype is the eh, and the oat instead of out."
2013-05-16T21:44:31-0700,Aaand how did we get on this topic?
2013-05-17T01:05:54-0700,"I think someone brought up the Canadian name for Gogoat. Also, what do people think that Stonehenge place is for?"
2013-05-17T02:18:16-0700,"^Possible ruins, maybe they decided to give the Regi's new forms or added a new Regi to the mix?Maybe the Unown make a comeback- I thought it was cool to be able to custom-build the Pokeballs............Ribbons reterning would be nice- I have an Absol with 47(?) ribbons on it- it would be shweet to stack more on it.I personally woould love to see growing/buying all the berries to make it's way back. Like, you have a garden beside your house- or secret base.Also what I am hoping is that download content will be something along the lines of opening up areas to the map. Accessing the areas after defeating the E4 is nothing new, it does add more to the play value after reaching the main story line and becomming the champ and all- but I think expanding the down load content like how it is for the Explorer/Dungeon games would really be a nice change."
2013-05-17T03:20:48-0700,"For me, I kinda liked the Pokémon Conquest type of crossover, so if they have download content I think it might be cool to try something like that, or perhaps some Donkey Kong Country Returns type crossover (navigation through the trees). When they introduced Dive, and added content under water, it seemed to open up more possibilities of movement in the games, so they need content to showcase the 3D environment, and 3D movement - possibly with a move like ""Jump."""
2013-05-17T14:06:45-0700,"So having had this explained...Why would you want to call it something pronounced ""Goatoat"". Plus, isn't it part Grass-Type? Goatoat might actually make a little sense..."
2013-05-17T19:48:54-0700,Has anyone revealed the 5th new pokemon?
2013-05-17T20:04:18-0700,"I'll go ahead and say no, since I haven't heard or seen any mention of one. However there's apparently something big going down on Pokemon Smash on Sunday."
2013-05-17T20:19:08-0700,Look in the background of this image.
2013-05-17T20:29:14-0700,No one's really acknowledged it as an actual Pokemon since it's pretty hard to tell what exactly it is. (It could be a decoration modeled after a Pokemon for all we know after all)
2013-05-17T20:35:17-0700,From speculation it is a pre-evolved form of Gogoat
2013-05-17T20:35:22-0700,"Good catch there, Trader. Yeah, to me it looks kinda like a couple fairly large guinea pig type pokemon that are green, grey and beige looking. Hard to make out of course since blowing the picture up only makes it more pixelated, but definitely worth a look.Edit: yeah, looking at it again, I could see those as a pre-evolution to Gogoat, especially since they are very similar in coloring."
2013-05-17T20:42:16-0700,"It's in the video too, isn't it?Maybe on that you can get a closer look...Though I can't take all the credit, someone on another pokemon community showed it to me."
2013-05-17T20:55:37-0700,"I think the Stonehenge place might be a Legendary's place, like Lake Verity with Mesprit or, remember how Junichi Masuda said back in Feburary 21st, that the games would take full advantage of the 3DS hardware, I'm hoping that Stonehenge place is like Outrealm Gate in Fire Emblem Awakening, where you can buy DLC packs. If you can buy new side stories and new places for X & Y that would be awesome. Also, if the Unown are in X & Y, they're most probably on that mysterious island off the coast near that town with the light house.P.S. I just had a thought. What if the Stonehenge place is like the Burnt Tower in Ecruteak City, where you encounter a trio of legendary Pokemon before they disband."
2013-05-18T01:21:41-0700,I read somewhere it could possibly be the place where you encounter Xerneas
2013-05-18T04:08:49-0700,"Look on the Kalos Region map, south of the castle with the pedestal, you'll see a forest and at the end of that forest, you see a giant tree. Also remember that in the very first X & Y trailer, Xerneas is shown standing in front of a giant tree, not giant stones and besides, that is way too close to a possible starting town."
2013-05-18T04:14:50-0700,"Who knows at this point to be honest though. In previous games the legendary appears at a location integral to the plot (which this stonehedge location could be), but since these legendaries seem to be different in origins as opposed to some previous legendaries we may see different locations for them like we did with Ho-oh and Lugia."
2013-05-18T07:39:39-0700,"But remember, that in the official trailer for HGSS, they showed Lugia and Ho-oh appearing in their respective areas and they did something similar for X & Y's official trailer as they have Yveltal in the clouds and Xerneas in front of a giant tree. To me, the only big tree I can see on this map is the one I saw south of the castle in the forest and besides, tell me one Pokemon game that has a main Legendary so close to a starting town (I'm a bit sick of calling it a possible starting town as it looks like they only town that would fit a description of a starting town)."
2013-05-18T07:54:52-0700,"I don't deny that, what I'm merely saying is that precedent says they should appear in the same place, but the presentation of the legends implies that they may not be.A personal theory of mine is that the three legendaries (assuming there will be a third) will also represent the three sections of the Pokedex, Xerneas: Main, Yveltal: Mountain, and Z: Ocean."
2013-05-18T15:18:36-0700,"Pokebeach has now just posted the last of the insider information and here it is:Pancham evolves into Pangoro in the early level 30s. In order to evolve Pancham into Pangoro, you need to have one other Dark-type in your party. Pangoro's type is Fighting/Dark.A Pokemon named Inkay evolves into Malimar. To evolve it, you have to hold your 3DS upside down when it levels up (the 3DS has an accelerometer and gyroscope, so it can detect that.) Malimar's type is Dark/Psychic.A Psychic typed Pokemon named Espurr evolves into Meowstick.Like in B/W, you have two rivals - one is friendly and the other is competitive. Your rival that is more friendly, gives you his/her fully evolved starter Pokemon after you beat the game.Another professor named Sycamore gives you either Bulbasaur, Charmander or Squirtle.Even though it shows the player riding around on a Gogoat in the new trailer, players can't ride on their own Pokemon. What was shown is just an alternate way of getting around Lumiose City and it only works with Gogoat.HMs still exist but there's a lot less of them.A new move, Belch, is a Poison-type attack that has a base power of 120. The user must consume a held berry to preform it.Draining Kiss is a Fairy-type attack that heals the user for the same amount of damage preformed. It has a base power of 60.The second forme of Mewtwo is to look roughly/vaguely similar to Mew.The correct types for the Starter's final evolutions is Fire/Psychic, Grass/Dark and Water/Fighting.This is the last of Hiro's insider information and since he has already predicted the names of four new Pokemon and what a new move did, three months ahead of being revealed, it would be stupid to take this information with a grain of salt anymore as it's most likely correct. I'm a bit disappointed in some of the information here such as Gogoat is the only Pokemon you can ride and you can only ride Gogoat in Lumiose City. Another piece of information has m extremely confused, the information about Espurr evolving into Meowstick. Sure, the names would make sense but the name Espurr looks Espeon and the name Meowstick looks like Meowth. The final part that I'm disappointed in is that Chespin's final evolution's type is Grass/Dark and Froakie's final evolution's type is Water/Fighting. I'm disappointed by this because I was really looking forward to getting a Grass/Fighting type starter Pokemon. OK, here the information and my opinion on it, now what's your opinion."
2013-05-19T06:56:30-0700,"My opinion is that it is all just speculation... Until I see actual proof, I'm taking it like a grain of salt.I read it and was like... ""cool"". That's about it..."
2013-05-19T11:58:35-0700,I'm waiting for the game to be fully released before I take anything as fact. I'm still looking around and cant find a official source that proves any of these claims.
2013-05-19T18:29:07-0700,"It's pretty stupid to think this all fiction, not fact as, Hiro, the guy who posted this has a lot backing up his information like:1: Hiro has already done this before. In April 2011, he revealed many Black & White Pokemon before they were revealed.2: Back in February, Hiro sent in this information. His information contained the four English names of the Pokemon they revealed this month and his information hinted at Parabolic Charge.3: It isIMPOSSIBLEto be able to precisely guess every single letter correctly of a four Pokemon that wouldn't be revealed for three months.Hiro keeps getting his information correct so it's completely stupid to call his information fake or fiction before it's proven as he is dead on with his information so you can consider it fake or fiction it's proven not to be true, which is extremely unlikely.The only thing going against his information is that it doesn't have an official source, but guess what? If his information had an official source then, we wouldn't know about this information so how about you stop judging his information until something is proven false as, so far, his information isvery reliable.Of course Hiro's information doesn't have an official source otherwise, everyone in the world would know about it and Pokemon would have it on their site."
2013-05-19T18:46:16-0700,"It needs to have a official source for this information. Perhaps someone at Creatures is giving him this information, if so, they may lose their jobs or he works for them. Until Pokemon comes out and say ""Yes, Fairy is a new type"" or other info Hiro is leaking, then it will be accepted.I take this news the same way I take the weather. If it rains, then I know they were right but weathermen have been wrong on many occasions."
2013-05-19T19:58:43-0700,"Actually, this guy isn't Hiro. He's the roommate of a guy who had a tester job at the American Gamefreak branch. That's why he keeps popping out English names. Gamefreak appearently managed to track him down the other day, so there won't be any further leaks from him.Pokebeach's first post on the subject makes it clear that he and Hiro are two completely different people."
2013-05-19T20:05:13-0700,"My only concern is...I know WPM is a legit source, but sometimes I doubt some of these ""sources"""
2013-05-23T20:09:38-0700,"Serebii has just posted that at E3, Nintendo will have a special Pokemon X & Y presentation/Q&A following their Nintendo Direct presentation. This presentation will run on June 11th at 6pm Pacific Time and will last 90 minutes. The presentation is run by Junichi Masuda and Tsunekazu Ishihara, the president of the Pokemon Company.I, myself, think that this presentation and Q&A will reveal a lot of information for Pokemon X & Y. I can't wait for the information to be revealed in the presentation as Pokemon X & Y information is pretty dry at the moment. What do you guys think of this?P.S. I posting this on this thread instead of making a new thread because this thread has been dying quite a bit after the last of the insider information was revealed."
2013-05-24T11:15:19-0700,"It is verychildishto boil every issue down to 100% for or 100% against. Even if the leak is genuine, we know miscommunication happens. Mistakes happen. The player base has more than once gotten worked up over, for example, bad fan translations, something that isn't even super-secret-privileged information.If you are mature, you takeallinformation with a grain of sale, even what you see! We live in a world where misinformation abounds, and none of us know all, see all, or understand all. Even what you see with your own eyes must be verified, because looks can be deceiving."
2013-05-24T13:56:15-0700,You do know that comment is almost a week old and that I don't care about it anymore.
2013-05-26T16:02:07-0700,"Then you probably shouldn't have posted it onto a message board in the first place; some people may not be able to rejoin a conversation for several days, or may wish to take some time before responding to give a more thoughtful answer.This is the internet; you words can last here for quite some time. :thumb:"
2013-05-26T19:01:18-0700,"As Otaku has implied, there is quite a difference between a forum and internet messaging. That's why you should always be willing to stand by your posts .... whether you think they are worth caring about or not. Learn to create and give out good posts and you'll never have anything to worry about when you're online.As for your earlier post, it is not stupid to think that some of that info from Hiro (or other sources) may be suspect. Just like me, and you ... he's not infallible."
2013-05-28T07:18:10-0700,"There is also a true sign of maturity and wisdom that is very rarely seen online; when you can come back to a comment you made and admit that you are wrong. Not because you just want to drop it or have been brow beaten into submission, but because someone has actually demonstrated it was wrong. This is something I struggle with, despite having entire CotD's over on Pojo where I had to eat crow."
2013-05-28T09:51:38-0700,"Wasnt this thread originally created to talk about the 4 new Pokemon that were revealed? Seems like its been a bit derailed for at least a page now...I personally love Pancham and Heloptiles designs, but I feel that Fletchling and Gogoat leave something to be desired in terms of design and naming."
2013-05-28T10:51:16-0700,"I just find Fletchling disappointing; like so many ""...this is the local version."" Pokémon, I'd prefer we actually got local variations of existing Pokémon instead of re-inventing the wheel. This could lead to alternate color schemes that aren't ""Shiny"" as well."
2013-05-28T11:14:16-0700,"I totally agree with you there. Really, the only way I can see Fletchling being redeemed as more than just another ""local version"" 'mon is if it gains the Fire type in place of Normal somwhere along its evolutionary line."
2013-05-28T11:22:30-0700,I would have liked it better if it were a Pidgey as they are suppose to be everywhere anyway. Its design is not that great IMO and it getting Flame charge is nothing that great as well. Just about every bird from the past gen got Heat Wave.I just hope its design gets stronger during its evolution.
2013-05-28T16:18:41-0700,"I'm simply going to note that this trend is also present in gen 1. (Lest we forget Fearow...although it seems many have)Plus most of the 'common birds,' have had very great differentiation from their bird cousins. Staraptor got Close Combat and great stats, and Swellow received similar treatment. Plus it isn't like there's great variety of normal birds in real life to begin with.It may be 'reinventing the wheel,' but there's more to the creation of a Pokemon than just its typing."
2013-05-28T17:15:23-0700,"Actually I have a soft place in my heart for Fearow; the fact that it is just another common ""Normal/Flying"" Type that fails to distinguish itself is on the designers heads, not the fans.These are video games; the only reason for Pokémon to be bland are they were designed that way. The reason many of us are complaining is that if we are lucky, a lot of these Pokémon only have purpose if they do have a good move pool or Ability... and then we get into the problem of how the rest of their ilk compete. Yes, there are some good examples amongst the Normal/Flying ""Bird"" Pokémon, but it is one of those numerous groups where it would be hard to make them all bland and forgettable.So again, instead of trying to find a way to make that Pokémon seem new, exciting, and different from the Pokémon in the previous game that filled the same niche role... just use the Pokémon from the previous game to fill the same niche roll, and give it a new paint job, Ability, or tweaked move list according to its new ""habitat""."
2013-05-28T17:24:02-0700,"But they're based off of real birds. Its not the designers fault that nature hasn't given them much to work with. Plus I kind of appreciate that all of the common birds aren't 'just pigeons,' and that we instead get birds of prey and nocturnal birds. Sure it doesn't do much for game design, but it does do wonders for world design. At least IMO."
2013-05-28T18:00:57-0700,"There is not a requirement that all real birds be adapted into the world of Pokémon as Normal/Flying-Types. It is a fantasy world, and even plausible within internal logic that some Pokémon could be more or less widespread that comparable real-world species.You know, I am fond of fantasy RPGs... and something that they have learned to do to make the worlds both more varied and more rich are things like applying local lenses to fantasy races. Of course, as I am talking about actual role-playing games (e.g. pencil-and-paper, not video games) there is more role-playing involved to actually make it relevant.Instead of giving me 650 Pokémon where maybe a third are memorable in the good way, a third are memorable in the bad way, and the rest blur together, I would rather we get more in depth with what actually exists. Even if the current model is followed, nothing forces them to be so restrictive with the typing. Why wasn't Noctowl a Dark/Flying-Type? The best reason I can think of is Murkrow was already coming out, in which case one or the other probably could have/should have been delayed until a later generation.Of course, that you like such things isfine. I am merely explaining part of why how things have been done don't reflect my own tastes."
2013-05-28T18:42:19-0700,"IMO expansion and enriching go hand in hand. As I said I appreciate the diversity of the common birds (and IMO they're all memorable in their own way) as it expands the world, and revisiting older Pokemon (ie. Cresselia's sidequest in BW2) is just as important.Part of the reason I love Pokemon is that it's so open to interpretation and available for different tastes to take advantage, and some of the birds cater to that. (Fletchling for example has become somewhat of a meme for instance)It's fine that it doesn't coincide with your personal approach to the franchise, it's difficult to satisfy everyone with anything, especially something like Pokemon with so many different creatures running around."
2013-05-14T14:07:51-0700,"I can't seem to find the thread where I read this, so I guess just take this as a rumor or theory, but I read about there being bigger differences between the two version of X and Y. Like you take different routes, therefor facing gym leaders in different order. Like in one version you will take a mountain route first and in the second version you take the coastal route first. Anybody else read this somewhere? I think it sounds interesting and I would love for them to make bigger differences between the two versions to provide newer experiences.http://www.serebii.net/xy/46.jpgYou can see from that Pokedex image that each ""region"" of the pokedex has a symbol. The coastal section is blue, so I'm guessing that's for Pokemon X. The mountain section is red, so I'm guessing that's for Pokemon Y"
2013-05-14T14:49:04-0700,"Well, personally I didn't read that myself, but I would certainly appreciate the games more if that was the case. Instead of buying the opposite one from my son's choice, I'd buy both for myself, and he could put his money on whichever one he chose. I already have mine preordered, so I hope they ""officially"" announce that soon, so I can preorder the other one as well. If this isn't the case, then I obviously don't need to preorder it, but it's certainly a nice bit of gossip anyways."
2013-05-14T15:41:07-0700,It might be something like in BW where you could only go west until you beat E4. In this case it could be in X you go coastal until you beat E4 then head for the mountains and vice versa in Y.
2013-05-14T22:36:24-0700,"Looking at the region map, it looks like Pokemon has it's own version of Stonehenge to the left of Kalos, along with a mysterious, single island, surrounded by stones near the top left of the map. There also appears to be a strange structure underneath the mysterious island, which appears to be something like a safari or a farm. Also, in the small patch of desert, there appears to be a group of strange, technological structures, one of which (the one near the magma), looks like the one from the first trailer. To the right of the Lumiose City in the center, the seems to be an old castle with a weird pedestal out the front. To the upper right of the Lumiose City, there is a small, white sort of building but is too small to tell what it is. Also, just below the castle, the appears to be a cave and yet another pedestal. To the right of the castle, there is what appears to be a cycling path. Can anyone figure out what these are for?Anyways, I think that the starting town is either north of the region in the town in the star shaped mountain area or is the town near the coast, south-west of the main city, near the weird stonehenge-looking thing. I think the most likely would be the town near the coast as it seems traditional for Pokemon to start you off in a town with grass to battle and catch Pokemon and besides, in one of the pictures on Pokebeach, it showed a wild Fletchling at Lv 2, being battled.Another thing I noticed is that in the Pokemon summary box picture of Chespin, Froakie and Fennekin, it showed that on the next page had ribbons. This could either mean that they are reintroducing Pokemon contests or something like them that earn you ribbons or that they've just done that because event Pokemon have ribbons.I think I found something on the region map that appears to be the doing of the evil team in the Kalos region. To the immediate right of Lumiose City, there is a giant, purple crystal. I also think that the technological buildings near that patch of desert also have something to do with the evil team.Looking back to the first X & Y trailer, remember the showed Yveltal being in the clouds while Xerneas was in front of a giant, hollow tree. Well Yveltal might be in the giant ice mountain as that has heaps of clouds over it and seems like the place to put a legendary Pokemon while Xerneas is possibly found near the giant tree, in the forest under the castle.Here are some random things I've noticed about the map:To the south-west of Lumiose City, there appears to be a place to grow something, possibly a farm.To the south of Lumiose City, what looks a giant performance area is there. Also, in front of it appears to be palm trees.There is two forest islands just underneath that mysterious island.Well that all I can find on the map, I hope some of these are revealed soon.North of Stonehenge, there's a place that kind of looks like it would be the perfect place for the fairy Gym (remember, we might as well call Hiro's information real as he's proven a lot already).I looked back at the first trailer and saw three gym areas, Psychic, Bug and Fire and going off Hiro's information about what gyms there are, here are a few of the gyms in the game:01: Bug02: Fairy??: Fire04: Fighting??: PsychicClose to Lumiose City, there's a place that looks like Kanto's route 12.To the east of Stonehenge, there is what appears to be a Pokemon Daycare.Near the cloudy Mountain, there's a town with a Windmill with a snow flake design that would be perfect for an ice gym.Just above the purple crystal, there's a mine with rail cart tracks.Well, that's all I can find on the map at the moment and I really hope someone replies on this thread as this thread is getting boring now."
2013-05-15T20:51:11-0700,"All I have to say why did they name the goat 'Gogoat'? Seriously, its like 'Go-cart' with 'goat' instead of 'cart'. *Snort* Its rather amusing to think about."
2013-05-15T21:38:03-0700,I think they named it that because you can ride it and it's a goat. What would have named it?
2013-05-16T05:47:17-0700,Why Goatout in a Canadian accent of course.
2013-05-16T09:37:21-0700,Huh? IDGI. Must be an American thing.
2013-05-16T11:40:56-0700,"Yeah, it is one of those American stereotypes.I think with each new generation of Canadian, the accent is losing itself, and could be gone forever."
2013-05-16T13:19:24-0700,"If it is an ""American"" thing, this Iowan living in South Dakota doesn't get it. :lol:"
2013-05-16T17:10:57-0700,Is anyone wondering what the Stonehenge structure might be for or anything like that?
2013-05-16T17:20:51-0700,"Yeah, I don't mean any offense of course, but as a Canadian, I really have no idea what he's talking about. Maybe that makes it funny for him .... hey, who knows? eh? Maybe it needs a bit more maple syrup eh, and Mounties eh, then it'll be hilarious."
2013-05-16T18:58:18-0700,Hes referring the the stereotype of canadians pronouncing OUT as OAT.
2013-05-16T20:25:57-0700,"Ah. Must be some sort of maritime accent then. Ok I guess. Kinda silly to call that a ""Canadian accent"" any more than a Texan's drawl or a Bronx accent as an ""American accent"", but hey, what do I know? Y'all might wanna know I'm from Ontario where there's no discernible accent. That's probably why I didn't get it. I guess that's why they call it a stereotype - cuz it's stupid and invariably wrong."
2013-05-16T21:42:50-0700,"I'm thinking the accent is from first generation Canadians. I still hear some people in Canada have that accent, especially aboriginal people, and they live in Manitoba. It isn't a Maritime thing, but more spread across the country. I'm thinking this accent isn't as prevalent in metropolitan areas, but it is most prevalent if your great or maybe great great grandparent was a Canadian.Here is Russel Peters take on the Canadian Accent... after him talking about the Indian accent.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uogdn7zWDmYIf you live in places like Toronto, you won't hear the accent. The place has been too Americanized. It's more in the Prairies, northern Ontario, and parts of Alberta.Newfies have their own accent distinct fromCanadian accent.In the end, some Canadians have it, some don't, and some don't realize they have it, and to Americans, the largest Canadian accent stereotype is the eh, and the oat instead of out."
2013-05-16T21:44:31-0700,Aaand how did we get on this topic?
2013-05-17T01:05:54-0700,"I think someone brought up the Canadian name for Gogoat. Also, what do people think that Stonehenge place is for?"
2013-05-17T02:18:16-0700,"^Possible ruins, maybe they decided to give the Regi's new forms or added a new Regi to the mix?Maybe the Unown make a comeback- I thought it was cool to be able to custom-build the Pokeballs............Ribbons reterning would be nice- I have an Absol with 47(?) ribbons on it- it would be shweet to stack more on it.I personally woould love to see growing/buying all the berries to make it's way back. Like, you have a garden beside your house- or secret base.Also what I am hoping is that download content will be something along the lines of opening up areas to the map. Accessing the areas after defeating the E4 is nothing new, it does add more to the play value after reaching the main story line and becomming the champ and all- but I think expanding the down load content like how it is for the Explorer/Dungeon games would really be a nice change."
2013-05-17T03:20:48-0700,"For me, I kinda liked the Pokémon Conquest type of crossover, so if they have download content I think it might be cool to try something like that, or perhaps some Donkey Kong Country Returns type crossover (navigation through the trees). When they introduced Dive, and added content under water, it seemed to open up more possibilities of movement in the games, so they need content to showcase the 3D environment, and 3D movement - possibly with a move like ""Jump."""
2013-05-17T14:06:45-0700,"So having had this explained...Why would you want to call it something pronounced ""Goatoat"". Plus, isn't it part Grass-Type? Goatoat might actually make a little sense..."
2013-05-17T19:48:54-0700,Has anyone revealed the 5th new pokemon?
2013-05-17T20:04:18-0700,"I'll go ahead and say no, since I haven't heard or seen any mention of one. However there's apparently something big going down on Pokemon Smash on Sunday."
2013-05-17T20:19:08-0700,Look in the background of this image.
2013-05-17T20:29:14-0700,No one's really acknowledged it as an actual Pokemon since it's pretty hard to tell what exactly it is. (It could be a decoration modeled after a Pokemon for all we know after all)
2013-05-17T20:35:17-0700,From speculation it is a pre-evolved form of Gogoat
2013-05-17T20:35:22-0700,"Good catch there, Trader. Yeah, to me it looks kinda like a couple fairly large guinea pig type pokemon that are green, grey and beige looking. Hard to make out of course since blowing the picture up only makes it more pixelated, but definitely worth a look.Edit: yeah, looking at it again, I could see those as a pre-evolution to Gogoat, especially since they are very similar in coloring."
2013-05-17T20:42:16-0700,"It's in the video too, isn't it?Maybe on that you can get a closer look...Though I can't take all the credit, someone on another pokemon community showed it to me."
2013-05-17T20:55:37-0700,"I think the Stonehenge place might be a Legendary's place, like Lake Verity with Mesprit or, remember how Junichi Masuda said back in Feburary 21st, that the games would take full advantage of the 3DS hardware, I'm hoping that Stonehenge place is like Outrealm Gate in Fire Emblem Awakening, where you can buy DLC packs. If you can buy new side stories and new places for X & Y that would be awesome. Also, if the Unown are in X & Y, they're most probably on that mysterious island off the coast near that town with the light house.P.S. I just had a thought. What if the Stonehenge place is like the Burnt Tower in Ecruteak City, where you encounter a trio of legendary Pokemon before they disband."
2013-05-18T01:21:41-0700,I read somewhere it could possibly be the place where you encounter Xerneas
2013-05-18T04:08:49-0700,"Look on the Kalos Region map, south of the castle with the pedestal, you'll see a forest and at the end of that forest, you see a giant tree. Also remember that in the very first X & Y trailer, Xerneas is shown standing in front of a giant tree, not giant stones and besides, that is way too close to a possible starting town."
2013-05-18T04:14:50-0700,"Who knows at this point to be honest though. In previous games the legendary appears at a location integral to the plot (which this stonehedge location could be), but since these legendaries seem to be different in origins as opposed to some previous legendaries we may see different locations for them like we did with Ho-oh and Lugia."
2013-05-18T07:39:39-0700,"But remember, that in the official trailer for HGSS, they showed Lugia and Ho-oh appearing in their respective areas and they did something similar for X & Y's official trailer as they have Yveltal in the clouds and Xerneas in front of a giant tree. To me, the only big tree I can see on this map is the one I saw south of the castle in the forest and besides, tell me one Pokemon game that has a main Legendary so close to a starting town (I'm a bit sick of calling it a possible starting town as it looks like they only town that would fit a description of a starting town)."
2013-05-18T07:54:52-0700,"I don't deny that, what I'm merely saying is that precedent says they should appear in the same place, but the presentation of the legends implies that they may not be.A personal theory of mine is that the three legendaries (assuming there will be a third) will also represent the three sections of the Pokedex, Xerneas: Main, Yveltal: Mountain, and Z: Ocean."
2013-05-18T15:18:36-0700,"Pokebeach has now just posted the last of the insider information and here it is:Pancham evolves into Pangoro in the early level 30s. In order to evolve Pancham into Pangoro, you need to have one other Dark-type in your party. Pangoro's type is Fighting/Dark.A Pokemon named Inkay evolves into Malimar. To evolve it, you have to hold your 3DS upside down when it levels up (the 3DS has an accelerometer and gyroscope, so it can detect that.) Malimar's type is Dark/Psychic.A Psychic typed Pokemon named Espurr evolves into Meowstick.Like in B/W, you have two rivals - one is friendly and the other is competitive. Your rival that is more friendly, gives you his/her fully evolved starter Pokemon after you beat the game.Another professor named Sycamore gives you either Bulbasaur, Charmander or Squirtle.Even though it shows the player riding around on a Gogoat in the new trailer, players can't ride on their own Pokemon. What was shown is just an alternate way of getting around Lumiose City and it only works with Gogoat.HMs still exist but there's a lot less of them.A new move, Belch, is a Poison-type attack that has a base power of 120. The user must consume a held berry to preform it.Draining Kiss is a Fairy-type attack that heals the user for the same amount of damage preformed. It has a base power of 60.The second forme of Mewtwo is to look roughly/vaguely similar to Mew.The correct types for the Starter's final evolutions is Fire/Psychic, Grass/Dark and Water/Fighting.This is the last of Hiro's insider information and since he has already predicted the names of four new Pokemon and what a new move did, three months ahead of being revealed, it would be stupid to take this information with a grain of salt anymore as it's most likely correct. I'm a bit disappointed in some of the information here such as Gogoat is the only Pokemon you can ride and you can only ride Gogoat in Lumiose City. Another piece of information has m extremely confused, the information about Espurr evolving into Meowstick. Sure, the names would make sense but the name Espurr looks Espeon and the name Meowstick looks like Meowth. The final part that I'm disappointed in is that Chespin's final evolution's type is Grass/Dark and Froakie's final evolution's type is Water/Fighting. I'm disappointed by this because I was really looking forward to getting a Grass/Fighting type starter Pokemon. OK, here the information and my opinion on it, now what's your opinion."
2013-05-19T06:56:30-0700,"My opinion is that it is all just speculation... Until I see actual proof, I'm taking it like a grain of salt.I read it and was like... ""cool"". That's about it..."
2013-05-19T11:58:35-0700,I'm waiting for the game to be fully released before I take anything as fact. I'm still looking around and cant find a official source that proves any of these claims.
2013-05-19T18:29:07-0700,"It's pretty stupid to think this all fiction, not fact as, Hiro, the guy who posted this has a lot backing up his information like:1: Hiro has already done this before. In April 2011, he revealed many Black & White Pokemon before they were revealed.2: Back in February, Hiro sent in this information. His information contained the four English names of the Pokemon they revealed this month and his information hinted at Parabolic Charge.3: It isIMPOSSIBLEto be able to precisely guess every single letter correctly of a four Pokemon that wouldn't be revealed for three months.Hiro keeps getting his information correct so it's completely stupid to call his information fake or fiction before it's proven as he is dead on with his information so you can consider it fake or fiction it's proven not to be true, which is extremely unlikely.The only thing going against his information is that it doesn't have an official source, but guess what? If his information had an official source then, we wouldn't know about this information so how about you stop judging his information until something is proven false as, so far, his information isvery reliable.Of course Hiro's information doesn't have an official source otherwise, everyone in the world would know about it and Pokemon would have it on their site."
2013-05-19T18:46:16-0700,"It needs to have a official source for this information. Perhaps someone at Creatures is giving him this information, if so, they may lose their jobs or he works for them. Until Pokemon comes out and say ""Yes, Fairy is a new type"" or other info Hiro is leaking, then it will be accepted.I take this news the same way I take the weather. If it rains, then I know they were right but weathermen have been wrong on many occasions."
2013-05-19T19:58:43-0700,"Actually, this guy isn't Hiro. He's the roommate of a guy who had a tester job at the American Gamefreak branch. That's why he keeps popping out English names. Gamefreak appearently managed to track him down the other day, so there won't be any further leaks from him.Pokebeach's first post on the subject makes it clear that he and Hiro are two completely different people."
2013-05-19T20:05:13-0700,"My only concern is...I know WPM is a legit source, but sometimes I doubt some of these ""sources"""
2013-05-23T20:09:38-0700,"Serebii has just posted that at E3, Nintendo will have a special Pokemon X & Y presentation/Q&A following their Nintendo Direct presentation. This presentation will run on June 11th at 6pm Pacific Time and will last 90 minutes. The presentation is run by Junichi Masuda and Tsunekazu Ishihara, the president of the Pokemon Company.I, myself, think that this presentation and Q&A will reveal a lot of information for Pokemon X & Y. I can't wait for the information to be revealed in the presentation as Pokemon X & Y information is pretty dry at the moment. What do you guys think of this?P.S. I posting this on this thread instead of making a new thread because this thread has been dying quite a bit after the last of the insider information was revealed."
2013-05-24T11:15:19-0700,"It is verychildishto boil every issue down to 100% for or 100% against. Even if the leak is genuine, we know miscommunication happens. Mistakes happen. The player base has more than once gotten worked up over, for example, bad fan translations, something that isn't even super-secret-privileged information.If you are mature, you takeallinformation with a grain of sale, even what you see! We live in a world where misinformation abounds, and none of us know all, see all, or understand all. Even what you see with your own eyes must be verified, because looks can be deceiving."
2013-05-24T13:56:15-0700,You do know that comment is almost a week old and that I don't care about it anymore.
2013-05-26T16:02:07-0700,"Then you probably shouldn't have posted it onto a message board in the first place; some people may not be able to rejoin a conversation for several days, or may wish to take some time before responding to give a more thoughtful answer.This is the internet; you words can last here for quite some time. :thumb:"
2013-05-26T19:01:18-0700,"As Otaku has implied, there is quite a difference between a forum and internet messaging. That's why you should always be willing to stand by your posts .... whether you think they are worth caring about or not. Learn to create and give out good posts and you'll never have anything to worry about when you're online.As for your earlier post, it is not stupid to think that some of that info from Hiro (or other sources) may be suspect. Just like me, and you ... he's not infallible."
2013-05-28T07:18:10-0700,"There is also a true sign of maturity and wisdom that is very rarely seen online; when you can come back to a comment you made and admit that you are wrong. Not because you just want to drop it or have been brow beaten into submission, but because someone has actually demonstrated it was wrong. This is something I struggle with, despite having entire CotD's over on Pojo where I had to eat crow."
2013-05-28T09:51:38-0700,"Wasnt this thread originally created to talk about the 4 new Pokemon that were revealed? Seems like its been a bit derailed for at least a page now...I personally love Pancham and Heloptiles designs, but I feel that Fletchling and Gogoat leave something to be desired in terms of design and naming."
2013-05-28T10:51:16-0700,"I just find Fletchling disappointing; like so many ""...this is the local version."" Pokémon, I'd prefer we actually got local variations of existing Pokémon instead of re-inventing the wheel. This could lead to alternate color schemes that aren't ""Shiny"" as well."
2013-05-28T11:14:16-0700,"I totally agree with you there. Really, the only way I can see Fletchling being redeemed as more than just another ""local version"" 'mon is if it gains the Fire type in place of Normal somwhere along its evolutionary line."
2013-05-28T11:22:30-0700,I would have liked it better if it were a Pidgey as they are suppose to be everywhere anyway. Its design is not that great IMO and it getting Flame charge is nothing that great as well. Just about every bird from the past gen got Heat Wave.I just hope its design gets stronger during its evolution.
2013-05-28T16:18:41-0700,"I'm simply going to note that this trend is also present in gen 1. (Lest we forget Fearow...although it seems many have)Plus most of the 'common birds,' have had very great differentiation from their bird cousins. Staraptor got Close Combat and great stats, and Swellow received similar treatment. Plus it isn't like there's great variety of normal birds in real life to begin with.It may be 'reinventing the wheel,' but there's more to the creation of a Pokemon than just its typing."
2013-05-28T17:15:23-0700,"Actually I have a soft place in my heart for Fearow; the fact that it is just another common ""Normal/Flying"" Type that fails to distinguish itself is on the designers heads, not the fans.These are video games; the only reason for Pokémon to be bland are they were designed that way. The reason many of us are complaining is that if we are lucky, a lot of these Pokémon only have purpose if they do have a good move pool or Ability... and then we get into the problem of how the rest of their ilk compete. Yes, there are some good examples amongst the Normal/Flying ""Bird"" Pokémon, but it is one of those numerous groups where it would be hard to make them all bland and forgettable.So again, instead of trying to find a way to make that Pokémon seem new, exciting, and different from the Pokémon in the previous game that filled the same niche role... just use the Pokémon from the previous game to fill the same niche roll, and give it a new paint job, Ability, or tweaked move list according to its new ""habitat""."
2013-05-28T17:24:02-0700,"But they're based off of real birds. Its not the designers fault that nature hasn't given them much to work with. Plus I kind of appreciate that all of the common birds aren't 'just pigeons,' and that we instead get birds of prey and nocturnal birds. Sure it doesn't do much for game design, but it does do wonders for world design. At least IMO."
2013-05-28T18:00:57-0700,"There is not a requirement that all real birds be adapted into the world of Pokémon as Normal/Flying-Types. It is a fantasy world, and even plausible within internal logic that some Pokémon could be more or less widespread that comparable real-world species.You know, I am fond of fantasy RPGs... and something that they have learned to do to make the worlds both more varied and more rich are things like applying local lenses to fantasy races. Of course, as I am talking about actual role-playing games (e.g. pencil-and-paper, not video games) there is more role-playing involved to actually make it relevant.Instead of giving me 650 Pokémon where maybe a third are memorable in the good way, a third are memorable in the bad way, and the rest blur together, I would rather we get more in depth with what actually exists. Even if the current model is followed, nothing forces them to be so restrictive with the typing. Why wasn't Noctowl a Dark/Flying-Type? The best reason I can think of is Murkrow was already coming out, in which case one or the other probably could have/should have been delayed until a later generation.Of course, that you like such things isfine. I am merely explaining part of why how things have been done don't reflect my own tastes."
2013-05-28T18:42:19-0700,"IMO expansion and enriching go hand in hand. As I said I appreciate the diversity of the common birds (and IMO they're all memorable in their own way) as it expands the world, and revisiting older Pokemon (ie. Cresselia's sidequest in BW2) is just as important.Part of the reason I love Pokemon is that it's so open to interpretation and available for different tastes to take advantage, and some of the birds cater to that. (Fletchling for example has become somewhat of a meme for instance)It's fine that it doesn't coincide with your personal approach to the franchise, it's difficult to satisfy everyone with anything, especially something like Pokemon with so many different creatures running around."

Also, if the Unown are in X & Y, they're most probably on that mysterious island off the coast near that town with the light house.P.S. I just had a thought. What if the Stonehenge place is like the Burnt Tower in Ecruteak City, where you encounter a trio of legendary Pokemon before they disband."
2013-05-18T01:21:41-0700,I read somewhere it could possibly be the place where you encounter Xerneas
2013-05-18T04:08:49-0700,"Look on the Kalos Region map, south of the castle with the pedestal, you'll see a forest and at the end of that forest, you see a giant tree. Also remember that in the very first X & Y trailer, Xerneas is shown standing in front of a giant tree, not giant stones and besides, that is way too close to a possible starting town."
2013-05-18T04:14:50-0700,"Who knows at this point to be honest though. In previous games the legendary appears at a location integral to the plot (which this stonehedge location could be), but since these legendaries seem to be different in origins as opposed to some previous legendaries we may see different locations for them like we did with Ho-oh and Lugia."
2013-05-18T07:39:39-0700,"But remember, that in the official trailer for HGSS, they showed Lugia and Ho-oh appearing in their respective areas and they did something similar for X & Y's official trailer as they have Yveltal in the clouds and Xerneas in front of a giant tree. To me, the only big tree I can see on this map is the one I saw south of the castle in the forest and besides, tell me one Pokemon game that has a main Legendary so close to a starting town (I'm a bit sick of calling it a possible starting town as it looks like they only town that would fit a description of a starting town)."
2013-05-18T07:54:52-0700,"I don't deny that, what I'm merely saying is that precedent says they should appear in the same place, but the presentation of the legends implies that they may not be.A personal theory of mine is that the three legendaries (assuming there will be a third) will also represent the three sections of the Pokedex, Xerneas: Main, Yveltal: Mountain, and Z: Ocean."
2013-05-18T15:18:36-0700,"Pokebeach has now just posted the last of the insider information and here it is:Pancham evolves into Pangoro in the early level 30s. In order to evolve Pancham into Pangoro, you need to have one other Dark-type in your party. Pangoro's type is Fighting/Dark.A Pokemon named Inkay evolves into Malimar. To evolve it, you have to hold your 3DS upside down when it levels up (the 3DS has an accelerometer and gyroscope, so it can detect that.) Malimar's type is Dark/Psychic.A Psychic typed Pokemon named Espurr evolves into Meowstick.Like in B/W, you have two rivals - one is friendly and the other is competitive. Your rival that is more friendly, gives you his/her fully evolved starter Pokemon after you beat the game.Another professor named Sycamore gives you either Bulbasaur, Charmander or Squirtle.Even though it shows the player riding around on a Gogoat in the new trailer, players can't ride on their own Pokemon. What was shown is just an alternate way of getting around Lumiose City and it only works with Gogoat.HMs still exist but there's a lot less of them.A new move, Belch, is a Poison-type attack that has a base power of 120. The user must consume a held berry to preform it.Draining Kiss is a Fairy-type attack that heals the user for the same amount of damage preformed. It has a base power of 60.The second forme of Mewtwo is to look roughly/vaguely similar to Mew.The correct types for the Starter's final evolutions is Fire/Psychic, Grass/Dark and Water/Fighting.This is the last of Hiro's insider information and since he has already predicted the names of four new Pokemon and what a new move did, three months ahead of being revealed, it would be stupid to take this information with a grain of salt anymore as it's most likely correct. I'm a bit disappointed in some of the information here such as Gogoat is the only Pokemon you can ride and you can only ride Gogoat in Lumiose City. Another piece of information has m extremely confused, the information about Espurr evolving into Meowstick. Sure, the names would make sense but the name Espurr looks Espeon and the name Meowstick looks like Meowth. The final part that I'm disappointed in is that Chespin's final evolution's type is Grass/Dark and Froakie's final evolution's type is Water/Fighting. I'm disappointed by this because I was really looking forward to getting a Grass/Fighting type starter Pokemon. OK, here the information and my opinion on it, now what's your opinion."
2013-05-19T06:56:30-0700,"My opinion is that it is all just speculation... Until I see actual proof, I'm taking it like a grain of salt.I read it and was like... ""cool"". That's about it..."
2013-05-19T11:58:35-0700,I'm waiting for the game to be fully released before I take anything as fact. I'm still looking around and cant find a official source that proves any of these claims.
2013-05-19T18:29:07-0700,"It's pretty stupid to think this all fiction, not fact as, Hiro, the guy who posted this has a lot backing up his information like:1: Hiro has already done this before. In April 2011, he revealed many Black & White Pokemon before they were revealed.2: Back in February, Hiro sent in this information. His information contained the four English names of the Pokemon they revealed this month and his information hinted at Parabolic Charge.3: It isIMPOSSIBLEto be able to precisely guess every single letter correctly of a four Pokemon that wouldn't be revealed for three months.Hiro keeps getting his information correct so it's completely stupid to call his information fake or fiction before it's proven as he is dead on with his information so you can consider it fake or fiction it's proven not to be true, which is extremely unlikely.The only thing going against his information is that it doesn't have an official source, but guess what? If his information had an official source then, we wouldn't know about this information so how about you stop judging his information until something is proven false as, so far, his information isvery reliable.Of course Hiro's information doesn't have an official source otherwise, everyone in the world would know about it and Pokemon would have it on their site."
2013-05-19T18:46:16-0700,"It needs to have a official source for this information. Perhaps someone at Creatures is giving him this information, if so, they may lose their jobs or he works for them. Until Pokemon comes out and say ""Yes, Fairy is a new type"" or other info Hiro is leaking, then it will be accepted.I take this news the same way I take the weather. If it rains, then I know they were right but weathermen have been wrong on many occasions."
2013-05-19T19:58:43-0700,"Actually, this guy isn't Hiro. He's the roommate of a guy who had a tester job at the American Gamefreak branch. That's why he keeps popping out English names. Gamefreak appearently managed to track him down the other day, so there won't be any further leaks from him.Pokebeach's first post on the subject makes it clear that he and Hiro are two completely different people."
2013-05-19T20:05:13-0700,"My only concern is...I know WPM is a legit source, but sometimes I doubt some of these ""sources"""

Of course, as I am talking about actual role-playing games (e.g. pencil-and-paper, not video games) there is more role-playing involved to actually make it relevant.Instead of giving me 650 Pokémon where maybe a third are memorable in the good way, a third are memorable in the bad way, and the rest blur together, I would rather we get more in depth with what actually exists. Even if the current model is followed, nothing forces them to be so restrictive with the typing. Why wasn't Noctowl a Dark/Flying-Type? The best reason I can think of is Murkrow was already coming out, in which case one or the other probably could have/should have been delayed until a later generation.Of course, that you like such things isfine. I am merely explaining part of why how things have been done don't reflect my own tastes."
2013-05-28T18:42:19-0700,"IMO expansion and enriching go hand in hand. As I said I appreciate the diversity of the common birds (and IMO they're all memorable in their own way) as it expands the world, and revisiting older Pokemon (ie. Cresselia's sidequest in BW2) is just as important.Part of the reason I love Pokemon is that it's so open to interpretation and available for different tastes to take advantage, and some of the birds cater to that. (Fletchling for example has become somewhat of a meme for instance)It's fine that it doesn't coincide with your personal approach to the franchise, it's difficult to satisfy everyone with anything, especially something like Pokemon with so many different creatures running around."
2013-05-14T18:52:19-0700,"BELLEVUE, WA—May 14, 2013—When Pokémon fans begin their thrilling 3D adventure in Pokémon X or Pokémon Y this October, they will be transported into an entirely new region called Kalos. A mysterious place that is shaped like a star, Kalos is a region where players will encounter beautiful forests, thriving cities, and many never-before-seen Pokémon. The central city of this breathtaking region is Lumiose City, a metropolis featuring a tower that is set to become an iconic structure in Pokémon X and Pokémon Y.While exploring the Kalos region, Trainers will encounter many new Pokémon that they can battle, catch, and add to their Pokédex. A Trainer is only as good as the Pokémon he or she befriends. Seven new Pokémon debuting in Pokémon X and Pokémon Y were introduced earlier this year—and today, four additional Pokémon are being revealed for the first time. These Pokémon add to the more than 640 Pokémon that have been encountered in previous games.· The cowardly Pokémon Helioptile, a Normal- and Electric-type Pokémon, can generate enough electricity through sunbathing to power machinery. But wise Trainers won’t be deterred by Helioptile’s lack of bravery. It knows Parabolic Charge, a brand-new move where Helioptile attacks everything around it. Helioptile's HP is restored by half the damage taken by those hit.· Fletchling, a Normal- and Flying-type Pokémon, sings with a beautiful chirp that is sure to delight any Trainer. Although it is known to be very friendly, Fletchling will suddenly unleash relentless attacks once it’s in battle. For example, when it uses its Fire-type move Flame Charge in battle, in addition to doing damage, Fletchling’s Speed increases every time.· With a leaf always in its mouth and an intimidating glare that is rarely effective, Fighting-type Pokémon Pancham shows its playful side when it lets out a little smile when its head is pat. Pancham can learn a brand-new move, Parting Shot, which not only lowers an opponent’s Attack and Special Attack, but also allows Pancham to switch out for another Pokémon in a Trainer’s party during battle.· Pokémon X and Pokémon Y introduce a new method of transportation—riding the brand-new Pokémon, Gogoat. This large Grass-type Pokémon is a reliable way to travel certain parts of Lumiose City. In battle, it can use Horn Leech to recover HP equal to half the damage dealt by this move.These brand-new Pokémon and others caught in the Kalos region will be added to a player’s Pokédex that, for the first time, will be divided into three unique areas within the region. There is much to explore in the Kalos region, and many Pokémon to encounter when Pokémon X and Pokémon Y debut worldwide this October.

2013-05-13T21:31:06-0700,"I did not have and plans on playing this game through because of a lack of Pokemon that I liked in the game so it killed any motivation I had to continue playing it. Since I could not return the game because it was downloaded from the Nintendo E Shop, I figured I'd just play it so my money would not be wasted.STORYThe story starts the same way by forcing you (The Player) to take on the role of a Pokemon by taking you from the Human World and bringing you to the Pokemon World. The game lacks the Personality Quiz to see who you will start the game as but give you the option to be one of five Pokemon of your chose; Pikachu, Snivy, Tepig, Oshawott and Axew. Thats right, the 5 Pokemon you see in the Pokemon Black and White anime on Cartoon Network. When you choose your partner, you can't pick the Pokemon you chose to be to start the adventure.The story start and you find out that the Pokemon World is full of Pokemon who have trust issues, making it know that ""you can't trust Pokemon"" as said many times in the game. Due to this, it created a imbalance that threaten to destroy the Pokemon World. The Pokemon you choose to be is haunted by a dream that shows a Munna being chased by a Hydreigon and it makes the player feel that you have to save Munna from this monster trying to do harm to Munna.After your first Dungeon, Virizion makes her first appearance. The whole town has a huge crush on her and are making it known. Dunsparce has the biggest crush on her and wants to prove it but due to you finding a gem early on in your first adventure you give it to Dunsparce to give to Virizion which turns in down rudely. Dunsparce runs out in embarrassment because of how he was turned down. Emolga, who is Dunsparce's friend started acting like he was going to beat down Virizion who was trying to be nice. Virizion just responded that she could not take it because she did not want to be used by anyone. It turns out she did not want to keep anyone too close to her because of what happened with Keldeo, whoher best friend. It turns out she was trying to protect Dunsparce. Virizion joins your team at level 20. Your main team may be around level 8 or 9.As the story continues, You meet Espeon and Umbreon, who are explorers that study Magnagates. They use cards that can open up locations to any dungeon and what to know how they work. They join your team at level 25 or 26, dont really remember.As the story progresses, you learn who your real enemies are. You learn that the dream your character was having has been taken the wrong way and that the true enemy happens to be Munna and that Hydreigon was trying to stop her from destroying the world. You learn that Munna was working with Kyurem to make sure that the ""BitterCold"" could not be stopped. You learn that the BitterCold manifested due to all the negativity that the Pokemon created due to their trust issues with other Pokemon. The character you chose to play as must overcome this. Hydreigon joins your team because your partner Pokemon was captured by Munna and her gang. You do free your partner shortly after. Hydreigon does join your team at level 62. As you continue, you encounter Kyurem who kills Hydreigon by freezing him into a ice block and then Dragon Tails him, breaking him into peaces.You do learn not much after that Hydreigon is the ""Voice of Life"" that has a connection with the Universe and that he was the Pokemon that call you from the Human World to help calm the calamity of the Pokemon World and to defeat the BitterCold. You and your team then goes to the flying Ice Palace. You do split up into team, though you and your partner Pokemon are the only characters you play. Once you get far enough, you run into Purugly and her gang again and must stop her before fighting Kyurem. In the fight with kyurem, I though it was one of those fights you had to lose to continue the story but I was wrong. You had to win the fight. What was worst was his damage out put was around 70 damage with could two shot your characters with his big attack doing around 115+ which is enough to KO your characters in 1 hit.After you fight and beat Kyurem, you go up against the BitterCold, which is a Ice Crystal monster that looks like the final boss from StarFox Assault. This fight is annoying because you cant damage it the first like 10 hits or something. The first time you lose you dont lose items but every time after that you do lose items. On top of that, this attacks generate random status effects and you also fight the BitterCold with just the Pokemon you chose to play as. No other Pokemon can fight with you, its just a one on one fight. The BitterCold's attacks do 35+ damage as well so berries,seeds and orbs will be your friend.Once you finish the BetterCold, you go through a 30 minute cut scene (it seems like it anyway. I watched like 3 episodes of Regular Show and it was still going) in which it ends with the Pokemon you chose to play as go back to the Human World, leaving your game.POST STORYWhen you start the game again, you go through another cut scene with you playable character ending up being your partner Pokemon. As you do more jobs, you get more cut scenes telling you more about getting your main character back. Once you do enough of them, Hydreigon tells you it is possible to get your main character back if you ""wish"" for it, if it does not unbalance the Universe. The characters go through moral issues, wondering if its okay to just remove that character from their friends and family just to come back. The game unlocks a dungeon called Worldcore, where you can go and make a wish. I died about 7 floors in because I ran out of items to use. I have not beat it yet. That dungeon makes you go solo and the Pokemon are really powerful and jump you 3 or 4 at a time. The Monster Houses are brutal as well.So far it seems that the post story is just getting back your main character so that's all I have here.GAMEPLAY and MECHANICSThe game plays about the same as the other MD games but has a few changes here and there. While the main core system is in tact, it does remove the hunger system from the game other then 2 of the DLC dungeons. The IQ systems work differently in this game. They are not Pokemon independent but work for the whole team instead. You don't learn IQ Skills but you find them. When you open up chest, there may be a IQ Skill in it. The game also has a system for attack growth. Each time you use a attack successfully, it adds to its total times used. Each 10 times you use, it makes the attack grow stronger. Attacks do level up and when they do, they gain more power and more PP. Whats even better is attacks share the same power. No matter who uses what, each Pokemon share the same attack power. So, if you play the game with Pikachu and have a level 7 Thunderbolt and later add Jolteon to your team, when Jolteon learns Thunderbolt, it will also be level 7. I don't really like this system because its takes away from the training I like to do in dungeon crawlers but it its welcomed.Monster Houses stick around but they are very problematic. They have a habit of putting a trap as the first space in the room, which for me ends up being a Sleep Trap which ends up in a loss you cant prevent. They also put Monster Houses in the same room as the stairs which are a pain to deal with and they should not be there. The Stair Rooms are suppose to be safe but this game does not care about that. They also force you to have many orbs and other healing items on hand at all time. Not a big issue but can be annoying.The Game also add something called ""V-Wave"" which is a forecast system ran by Victini that tells you what type of wave it will be for that day. The V-Wave makes certain Pokemon types stronger for that day and gives them added effects. If a V-Wave is Dragon, then all Dragon type Pokemon will be stronger and they will gain a number of effects.You can change the V-Wave once per day by talking to Victini. You can get a free spin or you can pay a number of P to have a better chance of changing it. Its smart to check the V-Wave before doing high level missions.DIFFICULTYThe game is not really hard but really annoying. All of the Pokemon in the game are over powered and the Stat to Level ratio is flawed. People also say some Pokemon can only reach a certain stat limit before they stop gaining. The multi hit attacks deal so much damage in this game and you will get a lot of deaths to them. The biggest thing to over come is item usage. You will take a lot of damage from everything. Your attacks miss constantly and the enemy will eat your items all the time. This is another annoying part of the game. Attacks that eat your items. You will lose at lot of important items like Oran Berries and Reviver Seeds this way.Attacks also deal inconstant damage to you. Most of the time you think you're safe until a Pokemon that should not deal a lot of damage to you deals over 100 damage. Most Evolved Pokemon are extremely overpowered. Braviary seems to be the most overpowered dealing a ton of damage and being able to take a lot of damage. You can also just hold the A and B button together and just gain health back because there's not real consequence to doing so other then the game threatening to kick you out of the dungeon for taking too long on that floor. No hunger means you can camp all you want.The game also gives you a lot of Pokemon that are a really high level. The first Pokemon you get is at level 20 with the last one being at level 62. Keldeo joins you at level 50. The game gives you these Pokemon and it make the game far to easy. What you you rather use, a Dunsparce or Hydreigon? The games main difficulty comes from random elements being against you most of the time. There is really nothing that you can do but hope for luck. The game also throws random elements to dungeons after you finish the main story. These can help you or hurt you. They range from level 1 to 5. The higher the level, the more ofter they happen. They can be either all Pokemon are sleeping or put you in a new dungeon to you not being able to use items.This is not really a difficulty but the game forces you to use Street Pass if you want to be revived if you died in a dungeon. This is a issue if no one in your area has the game so you can Street Pass with. It was better when you could call up a friend or IM someone and give them a code so they can rescue you. When I need a rescue, I can't use it because no one in my area has the game so I have to quit the dungeon and try it again. Not all games need Street Pass and this game is one of them.OTHER STUFF TO DOYou can build up your land to be huge Pokemon Paradise where you can see the Pokemon that join you walk around. When you take on jobs and complete them, you earn materials that you can use to build new area to add stores to. You'll also earn points to add to your Paradise Rank. When you rank up, you will be rewarded greatly, as well as being able to hold more Pokemon in Paradise. Like the last MD game, you can store Missions you want to do and do them later or you can do them right away. You can also do missions with a friend using the left Mission gate. This one is setup to play with friend. You can also fight against Legendary Pokemon. All of these missions are overpowered though you can beat most of them by smartly playing with Hydreigon. I have done this.You can also play in ""Companion Mode"" which is a mode where you can walk around with a Pokemon of your choice and do missions with them. You can't leave the Paradise area which is a big deal. You always have to have your main Pokemon in the party so you can't change the Leader. While in Companion mode you can only do missions and build on Paradise. You can also use four Pokemon you want other then the Pokemon you chose to play as and his partner. There is no real reason for this mode.On the main menu you can click a option called Discover a Magnagate. This mode uses your 3DS camera to find a Magnagate for you to play in. You must have a round object for this to work. When you find a valid round object, the screen will light up. All you do is push the A button and it will setup the dungeon. You play as Pignite and Servine as you explore the 5 floor dungeon. All items you find will be sent to the main game when you're done with it. The dungeon also saves to the list within that mode so you can revisit later if you like. Its good for a on the go person who has a few minutes to kill.You can also make ""Gifts"" to give to other Pokemon to make them join your team. Some of these take steep requirements to make. Most have a cost of 300 P plus materials to make them for the Pokemon you want to make them for while other Pokemon require 1000 P like Eevee, Emolga and perhaps the other starters. Not sure what makes Emolga special...You can also be rewarded with special gifts like a Water gift which can be given to any Water Pokemon. The downside to this is you can use them on evolved Pokemon. They will turn them down each time. If a gift does fail, you get it back to try and use later on a different Pokemon. The gift system could be better though.DLCThis game has a number of DLC maps you can pay for. You must pay for them all but they are not that expensive. I went ahead and bought most of them just to see what they were about. I did not buy the ones that allow you to get Pikachu and friends easier because I just don't care about them but I got the ones that add a bit to the game.This game handles DLC the wrong way. It forces you to play for dungeons that were free to get on the past MD games. You have to buy the 99 floor dungeon in this game. If one can be unlocked, I have not found it. DLC should be to add to a finished game, not add to a unfinished game. Still if you want to get then, then by all means get them, they are cheap and add to the game.IN CONCLUSIONThe game was not all that bad but I do feel this game is by far the weakest in the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series. The story in this game is very lackluster and not that long and the story is the main reason I play spin off Pokemon game. There is about 3 hours of total gameplay with most of the game being taken up by cut scenes. The game suffers from over simplification by giving you really powerful Pokemon and removing the hunger aspect from the game which is a big deal for a dungeon crawler and the overhaul of the IQ skill system and attack strength system means every Pokemon is always as good as they can be without any training. Even Pokemon that don't get used gain EXP. You are forced to have a large amount of items on you at all times to deal with the games random elements and are punished harshly when you lose when you run out of Reviver Seed and healing items or if a enemy Pokemon at your last Reviver Seed or Oran Berry.The game does a great job with the music and graphic. You also fall in love with characters you would not normally have respect for. I gain a new appreciation for Gurdurr as his character was the one to most develop the most from the others. The MD series does a good job about this. The Pokemon models could be better. Their animations tend to be blocky at times. I feel they were better off using the 3d models from Pokedex 3D Pro with this game because the in game models look bad compared to them. It almost feels like this game was rushed Most people consider this game to be filler while we wait for X and Y.The lack of Pokemon in this game is also a huge deterrent for players of the Pokemon game like me. Most players play spin off Pokemon games to see their favorite Pokemon interact in a would other then the main series and this game does not do that. It forces players to largely use (over 85 percent) only Black and White Pokemon with little options of Pokemon from older generations. This game only appeals to Pokemon players of this generation. This is a big deal for players like me and can ruin the games replay value.RATINGWith all that said, I rate the game a solid5/10. Like I said before, this game does not feel finished. It lacks a lot of what made the past MD games great and would not recommend this game to anyone other then those who grew up with this generation. The lack of Pokemon offered in this game makes it a hard sale for those hardcore Pokemon fan. The game looks and sounds great but that's all it has. If I would recommend a game in the MD series to anyone, it would be Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky as that game offers much more then this one does. Sky IMO is the strongest in the series. That game looks great, has the perfect difficulty and everything that makes dungeon crawling fun. GtI is just a game that seems made to just get a quick buck. I personally think the 35-40 price range is extremely high for a unfinished game that forces you to buy DLC to have somewhat the same experience as the past MD game. This game should be 20 bucks at most or offered exclusively as a 3DS Ware.Thanks for taking the time to read this."
2013-05-14T03:33:08-0700,"To be honest, I didn't get far in this game before getting bored and going off to something more interesting. I may go back to it, but probably just as a temporary diversion before XY come out.Can you review Pokémon Conquest next? That's what I went to from this game."
2013-05-14T05:03:40-0700,I can may a review of that game. I dont remember much about it but I can do my best for sure.
2013-05-14T13:26:23-0700,"I didn't have any of the problems you had with Monster houses, or with Pokemon eating my items that often.

You and your team then goes to the flying Ice Palace. You do split up into team, though you and your partner Pokemon are the only characters you play. Once you get far enough, you run into Purugly and her gang again and must stop her before fighting Kyurem. In the fight with kyurem, I though it was one of those fights you had to lose to continue the story but I was wrong. You had to win the fight. What was worst was his damage out put was around 70 damage with could two shot your characters with his big attack doing around 115+ which is enough to KO your characters in 1 hit.After you fight and beat Kyurem, you go up against the BitterCold, which is a Ice Crystal monster that looks like the final boss from StarFox Assault. This fight is annoying because you cant damage it the first like 10 hits or something. The first time you lose you dont lose items but every time after that you do lose items. On top of that, this attacks generate random status effects and you also fight the BitterCold with just the Pokemon you chose to play as. No other Pokemon can fight with you, its just a one on one fight. The BitterCold's attacks do 35+ damage as well so berries,seeds and orbs will be your friend.Once you finish the BetterCold, you go through a 30 minute cut scene (it seems like it anyway. I watched like 3 episodes of Regular Show and it was still going) in which it ends with the Pokemon you chose to play as go back to the Human World, leaving your game.POST STORYWhen you start the game again, you go through another cut scene with you playable character ending up being your partner Pokemon. As you do more jobs, you get more cut scenes telling you more about getting your main character back. Once you do enough of them, Hydreigon tells you it is possible to get your main character back if you ""wish"" for it, if it does not unbalance the Universe. The characters go through moral issues, wondering if its okay to just remove that character from their friends and family just to come back. The game unlocks a dungeon called Worldcore, where you can go and make a wish. I died about 7 floors in because I ran out of items to use. I have not beat it yet. That dungeon makes you go solo and the Pokemon are really powerful and jump you 3 or 4 at a time. The Monster Houses are brutal as well.So far it seems that the post story is just getting back your main character so that's all I have here.GAMEPLAY and MECHANICSThe game plays about the same as the other MD games but has a few changes here and there. While the main core system is in tact, it does remove the hunger system from the game other then 2 of the DLC dungeons. The IQ systems work differently in this game. They are not Pokemon independent but work for the whole team instead. You don't learn IQ Skills but you find them. When you open up chest, there may be a IQ Skill in it. The game also has a system for attack growth. Each time you use a attack successfully, it adds to its total times used. Each 10 times you use, it makes the attack grow stronger. Attacks do level up and when they do, they gain more power and more PP. Whats even better is attacks share the same power. No matter who uses what, each Pokemon share the same attack power. So, if you play the game with Pikachu and have a level 7 Thunderbolt and later add Jolteon to your team, when Jolteon learns Thunderbolt, it will also be level 7. I don't really like this system because its takes away from the training I like to do in dungeon crawlers but it its welcomed.Monster Houses stick around but they are very problematic. They have a habit of putting a trap as the first space in the room, which for me ends up being a Sleep Trap which ends up in a loss you cant prevent. They also put Monster Houses in the same room as the stairs which are a pain to deal with and they should not be there. The Stair Rooms are suppose to be safe but this game does not care about that. They also force you to have many orbs and other healing items on hand at all time. Not a big issue but can be annoying.The Game also add something called ""V-Wave"" which is a forecast system ran by Victini that tells you what type of wave it will be for that day. The V-Wave makes certain Pokemon types stronger for that day and gives them added effects. If a V-Wave is Dragon, then all Dragon type Pokemon will be stronger and they will gain a number of effects.You can change the V-Wave once per day by talking to Victini. You can get a free spin or you can pay a number of P to have a better chance of changing it. Its smart to check the V-Wave before doing high level missions.DIFFICULTYThe game is not really hard but really annoying. All of the Pokemon in the game are over powered and the Stat to Level ratio is flawed. People also say some Pokemon can only reach a certain stat limit before they stop gaining. The multi hit attacks deal so much damage in this game and you will get a lot of deaths to them. The biggest thing to over come is item usage. You will take a lot of damage from everything. Your attacks miss constantly and the enemy will eat your items all the time. This is another annoying part of the game. Attacks that eat your items. You will lose at lot of important items like Oran Berries and Reviver Seeds this way.Attacks also deal inconstant damage to you. Most of the time you think you're safe until a Pokemon that should not deal a lot of damage to you deals over 100 damage. Most Evolved Pokemon are extremely overpowered. Braviary seems to be the most overpowered dealing a ton of damage and being able to take a lot of damage. You can also just hold the A and B button together and just gain health back because there's not real consequence to doing so other then the game threatening to kick you out of the dungeon for taking too long on that floor. No hunger means you can camp all you want.The game also gives you a lot of Pokemon that are a really high level. The first Pokemon you get is at level 20 with the last one being at level 62. Keldeo joins you at level 50. The game gives you these Pokemon and it make the game far to easy. What you you rather use, a Dunsparce or Hydreigon? The games main difficulty comes from random elements being against you most of the time. There is really nothing that you can do but hope for luck. The game also throws random elements to dungeons after you finish the main story. These can help you or hurt you. They range from level 1 to 5. The higher the level, the more ofter they happen. They can be either all Pokemon are sleeping or put you in a new dungeon to you not being able to use items.This is not really a difficulty but the game forces you to use Street Pass if you want to be revived if you died in a dungeon. This is a issue if no one in your area has the game so you can Street Pass with. It was better when you could call up a friend or IM someone and give them a code so they can rescue you. When I need a rescue, I can't use it because no one in my area has the game so I have to quit the dungeon and try it again. Not all games need Street Pass and this game is one of them.OTHER STUFF TO DOYou can build up your land to be huge Pokemon Paradise where you can see the Pokemon that join you walk around. When you take on jobs and complete them, you earn materials that you can use to build new area to add stores to. You'll also earn points to add to your Paradise Rank. When you rank up, you will be rewarded greatly, as well as being able to hold more Pokemon in Paradise. Like the last MD game, you can store Missions you want to do and do them later or you can do them right away. You can also do missions with a friend using the left Mission gate. This one is setup to play with friend. You can also fight against Legendary Pokemon. All of these missions are overpowered though you can beat most of them by smartly playing with Hydreigon. I have done this.You can also play in ""Companion Mode"" which is a mode where you can walk around with a Pokemon of your choice and do missions with them. You can't leave the Paradise area which is a big deal. You always have to have your main Pokemon in the party so you can't change the Leader. While in Companion mode you can only do missions and build on Paradise. You can also use four Pokemon you want other then the Pokemon you chose to play as and his partner. There is no real reason for this mode.On the main menu you can click a option called Discover a Magnagate. This mode uses your 3DS camera to find a Magnagate for you to play in. You must have a round object for this to work. When you find a valid round object, the screen will light up. All you do is push the A button and it will setup the dungeon. You play as Pignite and Servine as you explore the 5 floor dungeon. All items you find will be sent to the main game when you're done with it. The dungeon also saves to the list within that mode so you can revisit later if you like. Its good for a on the go person who has a few minutes to kill.You can also make ""Gifts"" to give to other Pokemon to make them join your team. Some of these take steep requirements to make. Most have a cost of 300 P plus materials to make them for the Pokemon you want to make them for while other Pokemon require 1000 P like Eevee, Emolga and perhaps the other starters. Not sure what makes Emolga special...You can also be rewarded with special gifts like a Water gift which can be given to any Water Pokemon. The downside to this is you can use them on evolved Pokemon. They will turn them down each time. If a gift does fail, you get it back to try and use later on a different Pokemon. The gift system could be better though.DLCThis game has a number of DLC maps you can pay for. You must pay for them all but they are not that expensive. I went ahead and bought most of them just to see what they were about. I did not buy the ones that allow you to get Pikachu and friends easier because I just don't care about them but I got the ones that add a bit to the game.This game handles DLC the wrong way. It forces you to play for dungeons that were free to get on the past MD games. You have to buy the 99 floor dungeon in this game. If one can be unlocked, I have not found it. DLC should be to add to a finished game, not add to a unfinished game. Still if you want to get then, then by all means get them, they are cheap and add to the game.IN CONCLUSIONThe game was not all that bad but I do feel this game is by far the weakest in the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series. The story in this game is very lackluster and not that long and the story is the main reason I play spin off Pokemon game. There is about 3 hours of total gameplay with most of the game being taken up by cut scenes. The game suffers from over simplification by giving you really powerful Pokemon and removing the hunger aspect from the game which is a big deal for a dungeon crawler and the overhaul of the IQ skill system and attack strength system means every Pokemon is always as good as they can be without any training. Even Pokemon that don't get used gain EXP. You are forced to have a large amount of items on you at all times to deal with the games random elements and are punished harshly when you lose when you run out of Reviver Seed and healing items or if a enemy Pokemon at your last Reviver Seed or Oran Berry.The game does a great job with the music and graphic. You also fall in love with characters you would not normally have respect for. I gain a new appreciation for Gurdurr as his character was the one to most develop the most from the others. The MD series does a good job about this. The Pokemon models could be better. Their animations tend to be blocky at times. I feel they were better off using the 3d models from Pokedex 3D Pro with this game because the in game models look bad compared to them. It almost feels like this game was rushed Most people consider this game to be filler while we wait for X and Y.The lack of Pokemon in this game is also a huge deterrent for players of the Pokemon game like me. Most players play spin off Pokemon games to see their favorite Pokemon interact in a would other then the main series and this game does not do that. It forces players to largely use (over 85 percent) only Black and White Pokemon with little options of Pokemon from older generations. This game only appeals to Pokemon players of this generation. This is a big deal for players like me and can ruin the games replay value.RATINGWith all that said, I rate the game a solid5/10. Like I said before, this game does not feel finished. It lacks a lot of what made the past MD games great and would not recommend this game to anyone other then those who grew up with this generation. The lack of Pokemon offered in this game makes it a hard sale for those hardcore Pokemon fan. The game looks and sounds great but that's all it has. If I would recommend a game in the MD series to anyone, it would be Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky as that game offers much more then this one does. Sky IMO is the strongest in the series. That game looks great, has the perfect difficulty and everything that makes dungeon crawling fun. GtI is just a game that seems made to just get a quick buck. I personally think the 35-40 price range is extremely high for a unfinished game that forces you to buy DLC to have somewhat the same experience as the past MD game. This game should be 20 bucks at most or offered exclusively as a 3DS Ware.Thanks for taking the time to read this."
2013-05-14T03:33:08-0700,"To be honest, I didn't get far in this game before getting bored and going off to something more interesting. I may go back to it, but probably just as a temporary diversion before XY come out.Can you review Pokémon Conquest next? That's what I went to from this game."
2013-05-14T05:03:40-0700,I can may a review of that game. I dont remember much about it but I can do my best for sure.
2013-05-14T13:26:23-0700,"I didn't have any of the problems you had with Monster houses, or with Pokemon eating my items that often. I also found the dungeon where you played as your partner one of the easiest in the game(I was playing as Axew, so that may have helped).But I do agree that the Street Pass was completely unnecessary."
2013-05-13T21:31:06-0700,"I did not have and plans on playing this game through because of a lack of Pokemon that I liked in the game so it killed any motivation I had to continue playing it. Since I could not return the game because it was downloaded from the Nintendo E Shop, I figured I'd just play it so my money would not be wasted.STORYThe story starts the same way by forcing you (The Player) to take on the role of a Pokemon by taking you from the Human World and bringing you to the Pokemon World. The game lacks the Personality Quiz to see who you will start the game as but give you the option to be one of five Pokemon of your chose; Pikachu, Snivy, Tepig, Oshawott and Axew. Thats right, the 5 Pokemon you see in the Pokemon Black and White anime on Cartoon Network. When you choose your partner, you can't pick the Pokemon you chose to be to start the adventure.The story start and you find out that the Pokemon World is full of Pokemon who have trust issues, making it know that ""you can't trust Pokemon"" as said many times in the game. Due to this, it created a imbalance that threaten to destroy the Pokemon World. The Pokemon you choose to be is haunted by a dream that shows a Munna being chased by a Hydreigon and it makes the player feel that you have to save Munna from this monster trying to do harm to Munna.After your first Dungeon, Virizion makes her first appearance. The whole town has a huge crush on her and are making it known. Dunsparce has the biggest crush on her and wants to prove it but due to you finding a gem early on in your first adventure you give it to Dunsparce to give to Virizion which turns in down rudely. Dunsparce runs out in embarrassment because of how he was turned down. Emolga, who is Dunsparce's friend started acting like he was going to beat down Virizion who was trying to be nice. Virizion just responded that she could not take it because she did not want to be used by anyone. It turns out she did not want to keep anyone too close to her because of what happened with Keldeo, whoher best friend. It turns out she was trying to protect Dunsparce. Virizion joins your team at level 20. Your main team may be around level 8 or 9.As the story continues, You meet Espeon and Umbreon, who are explorers that study Magnagates. They use cards that can open up locations to any dungeon and what to know how they work. They join your team at level 25 or 26, dont really remember.As the story progresses, you learn who your real enemies are. You learn that the dream your character was having has been taken the wrong way and that the true enemy happens to be Munna and that Hydreigon was trying to stop her from destroying the world. You learn that Munna was working with Kyurem to make sure that the ""BitterCold"" could not be stopped. You learn that the BitterCold manifested due to all the negativity that the Pokemon created due to their trust issues with other Pokemon. The character you chose to play as must overcome this. Hydreigon joins your team because your partner Pokemon was captured by Munna and her gang. You do free your partner shortly after. Hydreigon does join your team at level 62. As you continue, you encounter Kyurem who kills Hydreigon by freezing him into a ice block and then Dragon Tails him, breaking him into peaces.You do learn not much after that Hydreigon is the ""Voice of Life"" that has a connection with the Universe and that he was the Pokemon that call you from the Human World to help calm the calamity of the Pokemon World and to defeat the BitterCold. You and your team then goes to the flying Ice Palace. You do split up into team, though you and your partner Pokemon are the only characters you play. Once you get far enough, you run into Purugly and her gang again and must stop her before fighting Kyurem. In the fight with kyurem, I though it was one of those fights you had to lose to continue the story but I was wrong. You had to win the fight.

2013-04-21T19:21:44-0700,"http://mynintendonews.com/2013/04/22/pokemon-x-and-pokemon-y-to-introduce-fairy-type-pokemon/If its true, at least its a new type to work with.Thoughts and opinions about this?"
2013-04-21T19:33:20-0700,"If this is confirmed to be true, I will prance around like a fairy.If they have that contest stuff where you are supposed to dress up your pokemon, I am going to dress up my fairy type in hockey gear, and call it The Rock.What I said above is false."
2013-04-21T21:36:16-0700,"If this is true, I kinda expect a name change to ""Magic"" or ""Light"" or something in the US. Fairy just doesn't seem to quite fit what they are going for with this ""new type"". Xerneas as a ""Fairy"" type in particular just doesn't seem to fit."
2013-04-21T21:44:02-0700,"Agreed. I think it should be Light, not Fairy. I'm hoping that Jigglypuff becomes this new type as Jigglypuff is definitely not a Normal being."
2013-04-21T21:58:31-0700,"In yugioh, ""fairy"" is the TCG version of the OCG ""angel"".I don't know how this is going to work in the TCG though. I really really hope that it is NOT a new type. If it was a new type, don't make it use its own energy. We don't need any more than 8.They could make all 18 types of pokemon in the TCG, but still use the basic 8 energy types. I saw a water card that used only grass energy in Megalo Cannon."
2013-04-21T22:13:59-0700,"Only matters in Video Game world. Like poison uses 'psychic' energy, ""fairy"" would be under normal type."
2013-04-21T22:51:11-0700,"Adding a new type would create balance issues I would think. Maybe if they remove they type normal all together and replace it it could work but after 4 gens with no new types added and 650 pokemon before that, it may unbalance the game."
2013-04-22T00:31:32-0700,"We had this same discussion about Mewtwo's new form being a clone and eventually I was the only person proven right. I highly doubt that Pokemon is going to announce an obnoxious new type such as Magic or Light because other franchises have those types. I think Pokemon just might announce a new type but it's actually going to have a better name than Magic or Light. I also think that Sylveon is the only Pokemon revealed that might have a new type. I doubt that Xerneas or Yveltal will have new types as it would look completely unnatural for Pokemon. I've played since Pokemon first came out and the pattern I've found with Pokemon is that they like to keep things as simple as possible. It makes it easier for them and easier for us. I agree with vaporeon's statement. If Pokemon was as messed up as some of you and they completely got rid of the normal type for a new type than it WOULD screw up the game. Like I can't imagine a Pokemon like Bravery or Ursaring being a Magic/Light/Fairy type nor can I imagine most of the other normal typed Pokemon being a different type. Another thing before I go, if this argument keeps going on with you guys thinking you're going be right, this topic will probably end with me being right again. A more than likely reason for Sylveon looking much different could that it is the first permanent female Eeveelution, like Froslass and Vespiquen. That way Sylveon stays a Normal type and Pokemon typing doesn't become any more complicated."
2013-04-22T01:00:20-0700,"If you can, could you please drop the elitist attitude. Its not a matter of being right or wrong."
2013-04-22T01:07:48-0700,"It is obvious that the new type of pokemon is called ""Newtype"". Has anyone watched Gundam?"
2013-04-22T04:20:37-0700,I find this post to be very ironic.
2013-04-22T06:29:15-0700,Especially when you're just as often wrong
2013-04-22T07:12:29-0700,"Its not about be right or wrong. I can argue a point if I think im right or believe strongly in it but I dont tell people they are wrong and im right.Plus, this is a public forum. My input is always welcome. This would be a boring place if the only people allowed to post are those who are always right and have sources to back it up."
2013-04-22T08:21:01-0700,It wasn't directed @ you vap.
2013-04-22T08:36:43-0700,"I think it would make complete sense for the new type to be called ""Light"". We've had Dark type for the longest time and we need Light to balance it. And this could make Xerneas and Yveltal, Light and Dark respectively."
2013-04-22T08:56:43-0700,"I think I'll go play Yu-Gi-Oh if Pokemon somehow decides to call a new type, light, because Yu-Gi-Oh has the same type called light. Same goes if they call a new type, Magic, and if Pokemon decides to bash it's head in and call a new type, fairy, I'll probably join in by bashing my own head in."
2013-04-22T09:06:10-0700,"Wait... You're going to go play another game instead of Pokemon because pokemon dares to have a similar type name as that game? Especially when thingslike thishave existed for a while?First I :lol:, then I :nonono:"
2013-04-22T09:36:13-0700,"The card game has had Light Pokemon. They were in Neo Destiny, so it wouldn't be a complete stretch.Drew"
2013-04-22T09:51:06-0700,"That's your breaking point?At first I was going to explain all the areas of overlap between the two games taxonomical systems, but instead I'll point out that if I was going to be worried, I'd be worried about the aspects of Pokémon that seem to line-up more and more with Yu-Gi-Oh; powerful, one-per-deck cards and potent, high rarity cards that shape a format.Otherwise if you think getting a Light/Magic/Fairy/Whatever Type is bad...The actual Yu-Gi-Oh TCG (as opposed to what was depicted in fiction beforehand) originally had six elemental-style Attributes (Dark, Earth, Fire, Light, Water, and Wind). Cards were further divided into 20 Types/Tribes/Families: Aqua, Beast, Beast-Warrior, Dinosaur, Dragon, Fairy, Fiend, Fish, Insect, Machine, Plant, Pyro, Reptile, Rock, Sea Serpent, Spellcaster, Thunder, Warrior, Winged-Beast, and Zombie.As if that wasn't enough (and kind of redundant in places), next the ""Psychic-Type"" was added. Then, the long time manga/animé/video game only ""Divine"" Attribute and ""Divine Beast"" Type began showing up on actual cards... and now there is even a Type called ""Creator God"" that exists for asingle card!I am not even objecting to you jumping ship... just jump ship to something that is doing a better job, not a worse! :lol:"
2013-04-22T15:50:32-0700,"OK, maybe, I WAS over reacting. It's just that I would like a new type that has a cooler name then Magic, Fairy or Light. But if Pokemon does decide to release a new type with those names, I would hope the new type be Light because that way it would make a lot of sense since we have Dark.I don't think getting a new type in bad but I would like it to be something other than Magic or Fairy. I'm actually OK with the idea of a new type being Light as it makes a lot of sense as we have Dark. You really didn't need to give me a lecture on Yu-Gi-Oh as I played Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh until 2 years ago when I quit Yu-Gi-Oh. Trust me I'm not going change games, I was just joking about changing games but I'm still serious about that fairy type part.You're mistaken. There are no Light Pokemon in the whole history of Pokemon TCG and they were decks called Light and Dark back in Neo destiny, not Pokemon types."
2013-04-22T16:39:56-0700,"I must say, if they balance the types, then the game will not be unbalanced... I dont see how that is such an obvious oversight. So many people complain about the types not being balanced if they add a new one, but where is your basis? You have absolutely no clue how they will balance it. Isnt it obvious that they will do some work to make sure things are balanced?Besides, I stand by my theory that Mewtwo gets an additional type with its new form that either makes it resistant to Bug or being a type that is SE to Bug. Otherwise, Mewtwo should get stomped by 5 Bug types considering its weakness..."
2013-04-22T18:27:23-0700,Adding a new type wouldn't provide balance because the type chart is already incredibly unbalanced to begin with. And Fairy is such an abstract and ridiculous idea for a type that I don't know how they would be able to quantify any of the existing nerfed types as being strong against it even if they did somehow think adding another type would be for balance reasons.
2013-04-22T18:48:07-0700,"I completely agree with you. Pokemon does NOT need a new type and adding a new type called Fairy is completely retarded. The only thing I'm having trouble understanding why you're calling the type chart unbalanced. In my opinion, the type chart is very well balanced at the moment. I really wish that Pokemon is just making us chase our tails about Sylveon's type and they won't add a new type but unfortunately, since Pokemon hasn't revealed Sylveon's type yet and it's been four generations since a new type has been added, it's most likely that Pokemon WILL add a new type. My only wish for this new type is that it is a retarded type such as Fairy or Magic."
2013-04-22T19:08:01-0700,"Some types are a bit unbalanced, but dont think that adding a new type is going to make it worse. Look what they did with Dark and Steel. I think it was better when they added those types. It seems like a difficult concept for people to understand that they can add as many types as they want and still be able to balance it. Its a poor argument IMO."
2013-04-22T19:12:25-0700,"Just a word of note, the Dark type in Pokemon is not like the Dark type in most other franchises. The Dark element in other franchises relate to actual darkness, or opposite of light, and has to do with the night. Ghosts, zombies, and the undead are usually the dark element.In Pokemon, undead pokemon, and moves that deal with the night are under the ghost type. The Dark type in pokemon has more to do with spies, covert operations, theft, or if you have played other RPGs, the typical moves a thief class would make would be dark type moves in Pokemon.So the opposite to the Dark type in pokemon would be a type that goes head on, through the front entrance with all the strength, which is why types like normal and fighting are useless against ghost type, while a Dark type is super effective against it, because it goes through the ""back door"", where the ghost is least likely to expect the move.That is why in the TCG, darkness pokemon are really good at discarding opponent's cards, because it is the type that ""steals"" things."
2013-04-22T19:55:33-0700,"I've also heard of the Dark type being considered ""dirty fighting."" That might explain Dark-type moves like Bite, Faint Attack, Foul Play, Fake tears and Taunt. This is why Fighting types are super-effective against Dark types as they are looked upon as pure fighters and can beat the dirty-fighting Dark types.Fighting types are already the opposite of Dark so having a Light type or ""a type that goes head on"" to counter Dark doesn't make sense. I think it would just make it confusing."
2013-04-22T20:19:53-0700,"While I think the Fairy typing is unlikely I don't see how it would be as bad as you make it out to be. If anything it would be fairly interesting to see as actual fairies in mythology are rather unique. From a balancing perspective I could see them having similar traits to dragons only with the weaknesses and resistances being mixed around.I've always found the idea of a Light typing relatively silly because I've never seen any real potential in actual Pokemon concepts that could adopt it without it appearing forced. A fairy typing on the other hand could have some interesting potential, after all a fair number of Pokemon already have draw from similar mythos. (ie Chandelure and will-o-wisps) Plus in a franchise that's had Dragons, Ghosts, and Psychics since its inception I think it'd fit right in.I don't find it overwhelmingly likely, but I'd be open to the idea personally."
2013-04-22T20:24:32-0700,"Balance can sometimes be best if an odd number is used for variety's sake. (Ex: rock, paper, scissors)-If, (IF) they do decide to bring in a new type, I would hope they keep the type coverage an odd number, as I personally think that ""the odds"" are better in favor of completing a balanced circle so nothing is over powering.Now, as far as balanced goes: I think the balance of types is good as it sits- the issue I see being where the game is unbalanced is in the actual number of Pokemon in a specific type. Water Pokemon have the highest attendence, with Dragon type being short end of the deal.If anything: abilities, base stats, and the total number count for the types is where the balance needs to be adjusted.Take out the Legendaries and the mini legendaries, and what do you have for choices to know which Pokemon are battle worthy on a competitive level?Each Pokemon has a design and purpose for sure- all of them battle worthy in their own way. But, looking to add more balance to the video game will mean that IMO they should focus more on adding in Pokemon that will boost the numbers in the ""rarely played""/""never used"" types and add in some abilites to open the doors for more options.If Gamefreak has decided to add another type(s)- I might be a bit sad, honestly. I think that other areas of the Pokemon roster could use a great boost in adding more usable Pokemon for competitive levels of play.I would be happy with the games getting more of a restructure on the roster and ability side of Pokemon, but I am a bit iffy with a new type being added unless there is 2 new types. If so, I would hope that the less populated Pokemon types gain a severe gain in more higher quality base stated battle worthy Pokemon for the sake of adding in the needed balance."
2013-04-22T20:25:33-0700,I dont see whats wrong with a new type. It just adds more depth to the game. Why is that such a bad thing in peoples eyes?
2013-04-22T20:29:50-0700,"I think people think it is bad because of the lack of certain types.Notice in gen 1-2 there were only a few dark and steel types.Now everything I feel is playing a certain ""catch up"" being dual dark- or steel-something.I think if they did make a new type, a whole lot of balancing is in order, but that might enrage the fans a lot.Like if I were collecting electric type pokemon, and all of the sudden, rotom switched to light type...I'd probably pull all my hair out."
2013-04-22T20:33:37-0700,"I only own Red, Blue, Gold, Leafgreen.I might get back into the videogames just for the new mewtwo thing."
2013-04-22T20:36:43-0700,"@ Pokemontrader: Agreed to the idea of a Pokemon getting a new type. I can easily accept a new form, but, I do not think I would be cool with if, say, Dragonite suddently became a ""new type"".Original is original, change is good. But keeping the roots the same is a foundation that holds to what something is kept building upon and moving forward. Sure, repair and patch, but keep the original secure."
2013-04-22T20:46:02-0700,"The addition of adding Dark and Metal to the game did not unbalance it and felt needed. If give other types better or worse matchups. It also made for some unique pokemon designs and typing, also making things like hidden power more useful.The problem I see with adding a new type 650+ pokemon later is the new type would be pretty much exclusive to gen 6. I'm fairly confident that sylveon would be a normal types because it shares many traits with normal type pokemon but for argument sakes, lets say it is a new type and that type is light because I dont really consider ""fairy"" a type or element. Sylveon would be the only Pokemon in its type, until more are revealed. Lets say this light type has no bad match up or dark is its only bad matchup and that Pokemon has a based stat total of 600. That means the light type would be unbalanced because it has so few Pokemon that can fairly have a advantage against it.Adding a new type would create a issue unless they go back and redesign every other Pokemon for Gen 6, which we know they wont do because of their current track record with BW. I think they need to work on balancing the Pokemon first (increasing based stats on older Pokemon to compensate with power creep, make Flareon better to better support its 394 attack stat, etc) before adding new types to the game. Also changing some Pokemon types take away whats special to them."
2013-04-22T20:49:16-0700,"You're mistaken; inNeo Destinywe got 20 Pokémon with ""Light"" in their names, intended as a balance to the ""Dark"" Pokémon (not to be confused with Darkness-Types) that were originally introduced in theTeam Rocketexpansion and also featured inNeo Destiny.If you do not believe me, simply go to the Researching Tower, switch to the Unlimited version, and pull up theNeo Destinyset.The Type system in Pokémon is... odd. I can't tell if they started with classical elements and then started adding classical elements of other cultures, or if they just started adding things that struck their fancy, but the end result is that within a Type, a Pokémon can be that Type because:1) They manipulate that element2) They live in that element3) They are composed (partially or wholly) of that element4) More than one of the aboveThat applies to Types that resemble the elements... a Fighting-Type doesn't fit that; instead a Fighting-Type is apparently a Fighting-Type just because. Most are at least vaguely humanoid, but I can't even focus on what might be considered ""Fighting"" techniques or chi manipulation as there is too much overlap with other Types.It is just irksome that apparently knowing how to throw a karate chop (Fighting-Type) is equal to utilizing natural venoms (Poison-Type) is equal to channeling the power of the elements (anything resembling an elemental Type) is equal to tapping the power of the mind and soul is equal to having wings some of the time (Flying-Type).There are also Types that feel pretty redundant, like how we have Rock and Ground, which could have been an Earth-Type, possibly with Grass-Types. One also needs to realize that the Type system is pretty arbitrary to begin with, often using video game elemental logic instead of what would actually happen if equal/equivalent ""Types"" faced off."
2013-04-22T20:57:24-0700,"Really? You quote my post where I LINK to a light pokemon tcg card, and you STILL make a ridiculous statement?"
2013-04-22T21:22:06-0700,"@Otaku- don't forget Garbador! Plastic element! lol,"
2013-04-22T21:24:18-0700,"It's not as terrible as it can be but several things about it are really unbalanced. Steel resisting like twelve types is of course the obvious one, but I also hate how Poison is only strong against one type, seven types resist Grass, Ice has only one resistance, Dragon has a bunch of random elemental resistances and is only resisted by one type itself, and Water basically only has one actual weakness due to Grass being an undesirable offensive type/every Water Pokemon learning Ice Beam to combat them anyway.Personally I've always disagreed with the notion that Dark and Steel were necessary types for balance. Psychic was broken in RBY for a number of reasons that would have fixed themselves over time -- namely the fact that there were no Ghost moves (and a glitch in RBY made Psychic immune to Ghost-type moves anyway), no good Bug Pokemon nor Bug-type moves and the fact that Psychic caused a 30% Special drop when Special incorporated two different stats. They really didn't need to create specific types to just to nerf Psychics, especially when in the process they made Steel so ridiculously overpowered."
2013-04-22T23:22:04-0700,"Fairy Type eh? We don't even know what the possible new Pokemon Type's Weaknesses and Resistances are and If this new Type is going to be added to X & Y then it looks possible that the next generation of Pokemon games won't be backwards compatible with Black & White and Black 2 & White 2 which means that with that kind of a change in the game's core mechanics which are fine as is in Gen V then nobody will be able to migrate/transfer Pokemon to the new games this Fall. Worst case scenario would be that Game Freak adds new Stat statistics, new Natures, and Characteristics (IV's) in X & Y compared to it's predecessors which remained the same since Gen III that would cause another technological gap that happened from the transition of Gold, Silver, and Crystal to Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald which Game Freak made up for with FireRed and LeafGreen on the Gameboy Advance, I'm hoping they don't repeat that again. But then again this new Type hasn't been officially confirmed especially on Serebii.net or on PokeBeach so it could just be a rumor as of now.Some of you guys might think that the majority of players who play the Pokemon video games competitively don't EV/IV Train the natural way but instead they speed up the process by using cheating devices which would be illegal for official VGC Tournaments such as PokeSav and Action Replay to get perfect flawless stats on their entire team(s) however there's Pokemon players like myself who have spent 4-5 years EV and IV Training up to maybe 15-20+ Lv. 100 Pokemon for competitive battling whenever I get the chance to and for that effort to be wasted cause I wasn't able to migrate/transfer my EV/IV Trained Pokemon from BW2 to X&Y would be a huge slap in the face by Nintendo and Game Freak. I'm sure there will be some way to transfer since X&Y is on the 3DS just like BW2 yet it really depends on how much of the video game franchise's core mechanics are changed and If they're changed too much then a transfer won't be possible. Don't get the wrong idea that all competitive Pokemon players use cheating devices to get flawless teams in the Pokemon video games, I was just trying to make a point. I remember hearing Junichi Masuda say that Game Freak doesn't have any plans to get rid of being able to transfer Pokemon from Gen V to Gen VI in X&Y.Makes sense, Game Freak could nerf down Stealth Rocks since that makes alot of popular Fire-Types like Charizard and Flareon almost unplayable. Flareon can barely stand on it's own feet without getting screwed over by Earthquake, Scald, Surf, Water Pulse, and Stone Edge so it's kind of stuck having to survive by making Substitute's to absorb attacks unless you switch into something that resists Rock and Ground or is a Gliscor since it doesn't take that much damage from entry hazards and it also has Poison Heal which gets around Toxic Spikes. Out of all the entry hazards in competitive Pokemon video games, Stealth Rocks is the most commonly used, and with less Fire-Types played competitively aside from Infernape not very many players run Rapid Spin at all."
2013-04-23T00:19:33-0700,"My main gripe with Stealth Rocks is its ability to hit for weakness damage on the switch in, which is broken. Even other entry hazards dont target every Pokemon as some can absorb or are immune to them. Stealth Rock would be better if it did damage based on what leftovers could take. A Pokemon losing 25 to 50 percent of its health on a switch in just is not fair."
2013-04-23T10:54:15-0700,"Things like Entry Hazards and Weather teams have made the metagame stale over the last few years. The only way GameFreak can alter the metagame at this point is to nerf Entry Hazards and Weather abilities. Hopefully, Fairy can make the game fresh. Not only giving players more options to work with, but to have unique winning strategies if you know what I mean."
2013-04-23T14:44:31-0700,"Yeah its a little weird but why is thiis a big deal all of a sudden? Its always been that way and I never really thought anything of it since I dont get whats so bad about it. Its a little odd but its just how the game is.In Gen 2 there was only 6 of each since they were 1st introduced and Pokemon was still beginning really. Now theres dozens, Im sure in Xy the same thing will happen.And why would anyone care if Rotom was a light type? Its not like it doesnt make any sense. Nobody is going to stop playing because of that. They are just going to live with it and keep playing. Thats just being close minded to say ""oh well im not going to play anymore because they changed a type"". It sounds like a mindless complaint about a name change at best."
2013-04-23T15:11:48-0700,"It isn't ""suddenly a big deal"". First and foremost, it came up as an extension of the discussion. Second, it was an annoyance in Gen 1; the longer it remains, the more of a problem it becomes. The original games were on the original Game Boy; it was a very restrictive console to develop games for. The DS was no where near as limiting so there is no excuse for keeping such a cluttered system. When retaining a mechanic makes the game worse, usually a good idea to abandon it.Now, you say you don't get why it is so bad; fine. I don't know if I can adequately explain more than I already have without derailing thing. Not everyone takes issue with the same things."
2013-04-23T15:48:59-0700,"Its also a bigger deal because we are in the age of the internet. They have never released information on Pokemon like this before, just showing a image of it. For all we know, Sylveon is a normal type because to me, its has characteristics as wigglytuff. If it is a new type, it brings balance concerns. Why this is a big deal is because the VG has became recognizable to TPI and Pokemon is about taking Pokemon you like and training them to be their best. If this new type creates balance problems for VGC and limits the playing field. EX Pokemon are doing this to the TCG and the VG has been on a decline as well. What they should do is balance all 800+ pokemon."
2013-04-23T16:03:23-0700,[citation needed]It's not a fact just because you want it to be a fact.
2013-04-23T16:49:06-0700,"...Umm...yes...yes they have. Zekrom and Reshiram had unknown typings as did many fifth gen Pokemon upon their first reveal. The reason why Sylveon is subject to so much speculation is because it isn't immediately obvious and it breaks some of the traditional naming conventions to the eevee family, which could mean something...or not, only time will tell.There are two major reasons why I have a problem with this. One, not all Pokemon are intended to be competitive, the VGC is only a part of the franchises appeal, and some Pokemon have other intentions. (Stunfisk for instance was likely intended to be a fun joke) Two, if there is a new type why is the only option more unbalance? If they were to add Fairy it could be a great addition, sure there are concerns, but that comes with any change. Also it is your opinion that things are unbalanced and on the decline. Don't abuse declarative statements like that, I beg you."
2013-04-23T16:55:16-0700,"What I was getting at is EX Pokemon unbalance the TCG because it shows favoritism towards the EX Pokemon. ""regular"" Pokemon can't keep up with them and require more resources to get them going. Ex Pokemon are on their own level.I made the comparison between Pokemon EX and a new Pokemon type because of how poorly executed Pokemon EX were and if they add a new type to the game and it ends up being like EX and that new type of Pokemon ends up being really powerful, then it will unbalance the game because of how low their numbers are when you put them against 650+ other Pokemon.Sorry that I cant find you a source on this but no company will admit they poorly design or execute something. I also never said it was a fact. Its a observation I made from watching how they are treating BW."
2013-04-23T17:04:32-0700,"Thats all it is just my opinion. I feel like things are on the decline, which is also my opinion. Pokemon should have more value then just ultra rares. Again, Pokemon not being competitive is completely subjective. There is no fact that says that. That is your opinion and I respect that. You may think the game is good and that your opinion, I think its bad, my opinion.You two seem to think what I say is fact when its not. This is just a discussion and I will add to if. Everything here is speculation so everything will be based on opinion."
2013-04-23T17:07:26-0700,I'm just sayin...
2013-04-23T17:31:42-0700,"Its my opinion though, so I can say that. Other people are also making statements like that saying the game good. Dont be bias like that."
2013-04-23T17:52:16-0700,"I get that EX Pokemon are making the TCG bad but how would a new type make the VG bad? People play the VG on a Tier system, the community knows how to balance out the game pretty well. All 800 pokemon wouldnt get balanced (since pre-evolutions are just a means to an end) and I dont think Nintendo is going to go back and fix every Pokemon, so by nature some monsters are just going to be better than others.And why would a new type be that bad? I doubt a new type is going to dominate a Tier single handedly or dominate anything unless its just made really poorly."
2013-04-23T17:55:51-0700,"Let me reiterate myself. The problem is that most of your posts state your opinion as if it were a fact, thus it is a declarative statement, and it comes across as if you are saying your opinion is correct. You may not intend that, but that's a fairly simple interpretation of it. If you were to add something like 'I feel' or 'I think' more often your point might be more understood, as opposed to polarizing."
2013-04-23T18:02:42-0700,"Light and Dark Pokemon are ruining the game.Wait, no....Pokemon ex are ruining the game.Oh, hold on, new development....Pokemon SP are ruining the game.Oh, nope, sorry again, actually.....Pokemon Prime are ruining the game.What?!! Now, apparently....Pokemon EX are ruining the game guys.(Substitute appropriate VGC equivalents here, because i'm too lazy, something about weather, spin/haze, entry hazards, steel type, etc)"
2013-04-23T18:19:22-0700,"That just means I'm supporting my opinion. I'm not saying mine is correct, that's just how you take it."
2013-04-23T18:27:12-0700,"True but like I said before, we have no idea what this new Type's Weaknesses and Resistances are so this whole thread is just pure speculation at this point. Also adding a new Type like ""Fairy"" wouldn't be nearly as bad as allowing every Pokemon to know 6 moves at once instead of 4. Someone mentioned on this thread earlier that not all Pokemon are intended to be competitive and that's true and ironically enough there actually ways of making Pokemon that seem like they aren't competitive just by their looks into being competitive. I've seen a really good Lv. 100 Magikarp own an entire team of Legendaries on YouTube in Gen IV so that says alot."
2013-04-23T18:50:33-0700,"I hate that video so much. The guy sweeping was using competitive sets, while his opponent wasn't experienced enough to know how to deal with Smeargle."
2013-04-23T19:28:16-0700,"I don't recall that complaint. I am sure someone made it, but if we give every complaint equal standing without appreciation towards how common it actually was... you'll miss just getting stuck with my rants. :lol:"
2013-04-23T19:38:14-0700,"As that was many years ago, I couldn't tell you who said it, but it was common enough of a statement at my local league. It's very possible that it was only contained within central california, however, given that every other ""high end"" mechanic has been decried as ruining the game, I have no doubt there were very vocal complainers about the light and dark mechanic outside of my area as well."
2013-04-23T19:47:05-0700,Was it approaching it from the same direction?The big complaint about the Light Pokémon was... they were really bad. :lol: I don't recall most of the Dark Pokémon being all that good either. I do remember much complaining (at least some of it justified) about the Neo-era Baby Pokémon and several of the decks that did prove competitive.
2013-04-24T07:09:35-0700,"Have you never written a paper in your life? Supporting your opinion (your thesis in other words) is done by giving well-thought out andcitedfacts. Omitting the 'I think', 'I feel', or 'in my opinion' does not suddenly make your opinion stronger. No PhD in history has ever just worded their thesis as fact without giving strong supporting arguments based on fact, research, or study before. There's a reason for that.You can feel free to say that you're worried about VGC balancing issues, for example, by citing past occurences and their effects on the game, or even using public opinion, but just saying that something is, is very misleading."
2013-04-24T08:08:31-0700,"I write papers all the time. School is daamanding that of me right now and I score very high on them. Ive played in the vg and tcg since the very beginning,. Ive seen the game at its best and at its worst. I just dont speak without some knowledge or first hand experience about what im debating. What I have experience is enough for me to base my opinion on, right or wrong. I also dont have to cite any sources for ""the state of the tcg or vg"" because all sources related to competitive play will be bias. I support my opinion on events that happened. I dont have to I think or I feel. Do you have the skill to read inbetween the lines?The new Pokemon EX are very overpowered. They limit the card pool. without them, the game is better.Thats my opinion. You may not think so and thats fine. I think Stealth Rocks is overpowered and limits the pokemon that can be used. No Pokemon should lose 25 or 50 percent of its HP on a switch it. Thats my opinion and I do thinks its a strong one. You may think other wise and call it ""skill"". I also think my opinions are well-thoughtout. Again, I never anything I say is fact."
2013-04-24T08:20:33-0700,"Then, when you post such things, put words and phrases in there like ""IMO"" or ""I think"" or ""I believe"". It makes you sound less mean (I would use another word, but nannybot) and more open to engagement, rather than how closed off you make discussions at present."
2013-04-24T08:37:02-0700,"Im no more adament then others making their point. I know its a opinion, you should as well. Even when I do put in the keywords, most of you still argue about my opinions. I just stopped caring about be formal. Im going to say what I have to say about the topic if I have something to say a move on from there."
2013-04-24T08:40:09-0700,That's more to do with censorship than anything else I'd of thought.
2013-04-24T09:40:43-0700,What I know .. I hope a new type will make things more interesting (if there is a new type)
2013-04-24T10:33:22-0700,"I know only what is put in text. Nothing more, nothing less."
2013-04-24T11:03:34-0700,Then its not my fault when people can't tell when something is implied.
2013-04-24T11:16:06-0700,Actually it is.So don't imply. You change an implication into an overt declaration when you add the simple tags to your sentence as Bullados has suggested.
2013-04-24T13:07:20-0700,"I work in the business world; of course I can read between the lines. That isn't the point. The point is that the way you write comes off as extremely closed-minded (I'm not the first to tell you this) and as not open for feedback or criticism. That's a problem when people are having a discussion which comes with give and take and an open acceptance of new ideas and theories. No one is correct, and no one is wrong. This is all what we think. But you make it seem like you're right and no one else is..."
2013-04-24T14:11:07-0700,"Most things considered ""facts"" are just other peoples opinions. Sometimes its a joke whats considered a thesis since its just a large collection of other peoples opinions. The only reason its regarded as ""credible"" is because those people are of higher authority, but realistically half the things they say are no different than you or me.Putting in those phrases is a waste of time since you have to assume what everyone says is an opinion unless its some sort of common knowledge.Either way what does any of this have to do with Pokemon?"
2013-04-24T14:16:11-0700,"The statements I make are up for debate, which makes them a opinion. I support them with what I think makes sense. If you want to counter it, then fine. If I can counter back then I would. Please explain how I make it seem I'm right and everyone else is wrong? To me, I'm just debating with what I know based on past events as I never once said ""this is fact"". I dont know what they are doing, its why this thread exist so people can debate what they thinkhappen.Sorry if you think I'm hard to debate with but you're going to have to deal with that. Its no different when you debate your points with others as well.There are many other sources that do not list ""IMO"", ""I Think"" or ""I believe"" when they make things knows. For example on a smaller scale; top 10 list, worst Pokemon gen, best Pokemon gen, best game, worst game and on a larger scale, The NRA, religion and other political organizations which are largely biased push their agendas as if they were fact, yet they dont use ""IMO"", ""I Think"" or ""I believe"" because andsince its such a big deal, they just dont make points look decidable. If you cant read in between the lines or be able to tell when a opinion is being stated, then I'm dont know what to say."
2013-04-24T15:55:36-0700,A little nitpick on that religion point...
2013-04-24T15:57:02-0700,Emphasisadded.I think you just defeated your own point. Most of the groups you just cited only refer to their views as opinions to be polite or to avoid potential litigation. Otherwise most consider their views to be factual; indeed I would question any religion where the adherents didn't consider the basic tenets of the faith to be factual as what good are reality defining beliefs that no one actually believes?
2013-04-24T18:18:22-0700,There's a huge difference between me saying 'I think being overweight leads to heart disease' and me writing a thesis with several studies and legitimate research done on the topic to prove it. A thesis has a LOT more proof than a sentence stating someone's opinion.
2013-04-24T18:27:40-0700,"@immewnity Fair enough but the people I know about, they make it know there is only one God with no other possibilities.@Otaku A good point as well. Those groups are extremely biased. Nothing they really say is a fact, just a group of people who share a same opinion yet they treat it as if it were fact. I used though groups to prove a point. I forgot to put PETA and extremist on the list. While they don't use ""keywords"" to make their points obvious but they stand firm with their opinions. I'm just one person with a opinion. While my opinion is made stronger if other people share the same views, my opinion is on its own as a observation is still valid.I was basically supporting my own opinion with what I thought was a strong argument. If others need keywords to identify a opinion, then that is their short coming, not mine. Then all of a sudden people want me to cite sources that validate my claim. I don't have one because all sources are biased about if the game is good or not. I've played many formats, both I deemed good and bad and have watched the power creep the video games went through. I have my opinion about the game state just like any other.I challenge anyone to find me a official source from Pokemon that says ""not all Pokemon were created to be competitive"", since citing became important all of a sudden because competitive is subjective. Fine me a official source saying ""We know the TCG is in a good or bad state"" from Pokemon. The big difference between me and very opinionated organizations is they have WAY more people following them then I do."
2013-04-24T18:34:59-0700,"Thats backed by facts, research and scientist who can validate it. The Pokemon TCG and VG do not have facts backed by research so when we speak on it, its people who speak on what they think may change with the game. Nothing is factual with Pokemon until Pokemon makes it so.It was almost a universal know thing that Sabldonk was bad for the game and would have ruined the next large tournament. Nations and Worlds I think. They released a statement say The next format would be HGSS on for that tournament to keep the game balanced, in a nutshell.We can't compare Pokemon, that has no official backing on what is until it happens with Heart Disease which is back by research."
2013-04-24T20:30:11-0700,"Plus not all scientific ""facts"" end up always being true, half the time it really is just opinion. Theres a lot of things people claim to be true but end up being the complete opposite.Realistically, theres very few truths in our world. Most things end up just being about perspective. Even science has failed a lot in explaining how things really work."
2013-04-26T16:54:25-0700,"I'm not gonna lie, my favorite part of this thread is the intervention we are having with vaporeon.""Please vaporeon sit down over there, we are all here because we care about you..."""
2013-04-26T17:13:33-0700,"Just so you know, somewhere, deep down in my heart, I still love you.YEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"
2013-04-27T05:20:41-0700,I'd vote for a Lunar or Planar type of Pokemon. So many of these guys seem to be from outer space anyway.
2013-04-27T12:30:09-0700,"Wow, that is on topic and actually makes at least as much sense as the existing types. I could appreciate such a Type myself."
2013-04-27T13:23:40-0700,"The amount of play testing for adding in a new Type- has anyone consdiered this aspect?Balance among the Types vs balance of the sheer numbers of Pokemon in a type- I would chose to go with adding in more Pokemon to the existing Types we have for the sake of variety.We could see more new attacks as well, since IMO there are some types that could use a better boost in more powerfull attacks or gimmicks."
2013-04-27T13:54:48-0700,Can of what I was saying. They would need to balance this new type to work with over 650 Pokemon and their existing types.
2013-04-29T04:54:27-0700,"Not sure if it's important to balance pokemon at the moment or not. Honestly I can't see how bringing in a new type would be worth reworking all current pokemon. If it was me and I HAD to bring in a new type, I'd just work it into current scheme of things to try to slightly balance things out more. However, since I'm just a player, the only opinion of mine that counts is as a consumer. Personally I'm not fond of their record so far in terms of introducing new types - in both the VG and TCG. Not that I'd have them taken away of course, but most of their introductions in both games have been gimmicky, mostly awkward, and somewhat painful. I hope they don't introduce a new type. However, I'd continue to play the VG regardless."
2013-04-21T19:21:44-0700,"http://mynintendonews.com/2013/04/22/pokemon-x-and-pokemon-y-to-introduce-fairy-type-pokemon/If its true, at least its a new type to work with.Thoughts and opinions about this?"
2013-04-21T19:33:20-0700,"If this is confirmed to be true, I will prance around like a fairy.If they have that contest stuff where you are supposed to dress up your pokemon, I am going to dress up my fairy type in hockey gear, and call it The Rock.What I said above is false."
2013-04-21T21:36:16-0700,"If this is true, I kinda expect a name change to ""Magic"" or ""Light"" or something in the US. Fairy just doesn't seem to quite fit what they are going for with this ""new type"". Xerneas as a ""Fairy"" type in particular just doesn't seem to fit."
2013-04-21T21:44:02-0700,"Agreed. I think it should be Light, not Fairy. I'm hoping that Jigglypuff becomes this new type as Jigglypuff is definitely not a Normal being."
2013-04-21T21:58:31-0700,"In yugioh, ""fairy"" is the TCG version of the OCG ""angel"".I don't know how this is going to work in the TCG though. I really really hope that it is NOT a new type. If it was a new type, don't make it use its own energy. We don't need any more than 8.They could make all 18 types of pokemon in the TCG, but still use the basic 8 energy types. I saw a water card that used only grass energy in Megalo Cannon."
2013-04-21T22:13:59-0700,"Only matters in Video Game world. Like poison uses 'psychic' energy, ""fairy"" would be under normal type."
2013-04-21T22:51:11-0700,"Adding a new type would create balance issues I would think. Maybe if they remove they type normal all together and replace it it could work but after 4 gens with no new types added and 650 pokemon before that, it may unbalance the game."
2013-04-22T00:31:32-0700,"We had this same discussion about Mewtwo's new form being a clone and eventually I was the only person proven right. I highly doubt that Pokemon is going to announce an obnoxious new type such as Magic or Light because other franchises have those types. I think Pokemon just might announce a new type but it's actually going to have a better name than Magic or Light. I also think that Sylveon is the only Pokemon revealed that might have a new type. I doubt that Xerneas or Yveltal will have new types as it would look completely unnatural for Pokemon. I've played since Pokemon first came out and the pattern I've found with Pokemon is that they like to keep things as simple as possible. It makes it easier for them and easier for us. I agree with vaporeon's statement. If Pokemon was as messed up as some of you and they completely got rid of the normal type for a new type than it WOULD screw up the game. Like I can't imagine a Pokemon like Bravery or Ursaring being a Magic/Light/Fairy type nor can I imagine most of the other normal typed Pokemon being a different type. Another thing before I go, if this argument keeps going on with you guys thinking you're going be right, this topic will probably end with me being right again. A more than likely reason for Sylveon looking much different could that it is the first permanent female Eeveelution, like Froslass and Vespiquen. That way Sylveon stays a Normal type and Pokemon typing doesn't become any more complicated."
2013-04-22T01:00:20-0700,"If you can, could you please drop the elitist attitude. Its not a matter of being right or wrong."
2013-04-22T01:07:48-0700,"It is obvious that the new type of pokemon is called ""Newtype"". Has anyone watched Gundam?"
2013-04-22T04:20:37-0700,I find this post to be very ironic.
2013-04-22T06:29:15-0700,Especially when you're just as often wrong
2013-04-22T07:12:29-0700,"Its not about be right or wrong. I can argue a point if I think im right or believe strongly in it but I dont tell people they are wrong and im right.Plus, this is a public forum. My input is always welcome. This would be a boring place if the only people allowed to post are those who are always right and have sources to back it up."
2013-04-22T08:21:01-0700,It wasn't directed @ you vap.
2013-04-22T08:36:43-0700,"I think it would make complete sense for the new type to be called ""Light"". We've had Dark type for the longest time and we need Light to balance it. And this could make Xerneas and Yveltal, Light and Dark respectively."
2013-04-22T08:56:43-0700,"I think I'll go play Yu-Gi-Oh if Pokemon somehow decides to call a new type, light, because Yu-Gi-Oh has the same type called light. Same goes if they call a new type, Magic, and if Pokemon decides to bash it's head in and call a new type, fairy, I'll probably join in by bashing my own head in."
2013-04-22T09:06:10-0700,"Wait... You're going to go play another game instead of Pokemon because pokemon dares to have a similar type name as that game? Especially when thingslike thishave existed for a while?First I :lol:, then I :nonono:"
2013-04-22T09:36:13-0700,"The card game has had Light Pokemon. They were in Neo Destiny, so it wouldn't be a complete stretch.Drew"
2013-04-22T09:51:06-0700,"That's your breaking point?At first I was going to explain all the areas of overlap between the two games taxonomical systems, but instead I'll point out that if I was going to be worried, I'd be worried about the aspects of Pokémon that seem to line-up more and more with Yu-Gi-Oh; powerful, one-per-deck cards and potent, high rarity cards that shape a format.Otherwise if you think getting a Light/Magic/Fairy/Whatever Type is bad...The actual Yu-Gi-Oh TCG (as opposed to what was depicted in fiction beforehand) originally had six elemental-style Attributes (Dark, Earth, Fire, Light, Water, and Wind). Cards were further divided into 20 Types/Tribes/Families: Aqua, Beast, Beast-Warrior, Dinosaur, Dragon, Fairy, Fiend, Fish, Insect, Machine, Plant, Pyro, Reptile, Rock, Sea Serpent, Spellcaster, Thunder, Warrior, Winged-Beast, and Zombie.As if that wasn't enough (and kind of redundant in places), next the ""Psychic-Type"" was added. Then, the long time manga/animé/video game only ""Divine"" Attribute and ""Divine Beast"" Type began showing up on actual cards... and now there is even a Type called ""Creator God"" that exists for asingle card!I am not even objecting to you jumping ship... just jump ship to something that is doing a better job, not a worse! :lol:"
2013-04-22T15:50:32-0700,"OK, maybe, I WAS over reacting. It's just that I would like a new type that has a cooler name then Magic, Fairy or Light. But if Pokemon does decide to release a new type with those names, I would hope the new type be Light because that way it would make a lot of sense since we have Dark.I don't think getting a new type in bad but I would like it to be something other than Magic or Fairy. I'm actually OK with the idea of a new type being Light as it makes a lot of sense as we have Dark. You really didn't need to give me a lecture on Yu-Gi-Oh as I played Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh until 2 years ago when I quit Yu-Gi-Oh. Trust me I'm not going change games, I was just joking about changing games but I'm still serious about that fairy type part.You're mistaken. There are no Light Pokemon in the whole history of Pokemon TCG and they were decks called Light and Dark back in Neo destiny, not Pokemon types."
2013-04-22T16:39:56-0700,"I must say, if they balance the types, then the game will not be unbalanced... I dont see how that is such an obvious oversight. So many people complain about the types not being balanced if they add a new one, but where is your basis? You have absolutely no clue how they will balance it. Isnt it obvious that they will do some work to make sure things are balanced?Besides, I stand by my theory that Mewtwo gets an additional type with its new form that either makes it resistant to Bug or being a type that is SE to Bug. Otherwise, Mewtwo should get stomped by 5 Bug types considering its weakness..."
2013-04-22T18:27:23-0700,Adding a new type wouldn't provide balance because the type chart is already incredibly unbalanced to begin with. And Fairy is such an abstract and ridiculous idea for a type that I don't know how they would be able to quantify any of the existing nerfed types as being strong against it even if they did somehow think adding another type would be for balance reasons.
2013-04-22T18:48:07-0700,"I completely agree with you. Pokemon does NOT need a new type and adding a new type called Fairy is completely retarded. The only thing I'm having trouble understanding why you're calling the type chart unbalanced. In my opinion, the type chart is very well balanced at the moment. I really wish that Pokemon is just making us chase our tails about Sylveon's type and they won't add a new type but unfortunately, since Pokemon hasn't revealed Sylveon's type yet and it's been four generations since a new type has been added, it's most likely that Pokemon WILL add a new type. My only wish for this new type is that it is a retarded type such as Fairy or Magic."
2013-04-22T19:08:01-0700,"Some types are a bit unbalanced, but dont think that adding a new type is going to make it worse. Look what they did with Dark and Steel. I think it was better when they added those types. It seems like a difficult concept for people to understand that they can add as many types as they want and still be able to balance it. Its a poor argument IMO."
2013-04-22T19:12:25-0700,"Just a word of note, the Dark type in Pokemon is not like the Dark type in most other franchises. The Dark element in other franchises relate to actual darkness, or opposite of light, and has to do with the night. Ghosts, zombies, and the undead are usually the dark element.In Pokemon, undead pokemon, and moves that deal with the night are under the ghost type. The Dark type in pokemon has more to do with spies, covert operations, theft, or if you have played other RPGs, the typical moves a thief class would make would be dark type moves in Pokemon.So the opposite to the Dark type in pokemon would be a type that goes head on, through the front entrance with all the strength, which is why types like normal and fighting are useless against ghost type, while a Dark type is super effective against it, because it goes through the ""back door"", where the ghost is least likely to expect the move.That is why in the TCG, darkness pokemon are really good at discarding opponent's cards, because it is the type that ""steals"" things."
2013-04-22T19:55:33-0700,"I've also heard of the Dark type being considered ""dirty fighting."" That might explain Dark-type moves like Bite, Faint Attack, Foul Play, Fake tears and Taunt. This is why Fighting types are super-effective against Dark types as they are looked upon as pure fighters and can beat the dirty-fighting Dark types.Fighting types are already the opposite of Dark so having a Light type or ""a type that goes head on"" to counter Dark doesn't make sense. I think it would just make it confusing."
2013-04-22T20:19:53-0700,"While I think the Fairy typing is unlikely I don't see how it would be as bad as you make it out to be. If anything it would be fairly interesting to see as actual fairies in mythology are rather unique. From a balancing perspective I could see them having similar traits to dragons only with the weaknesses and resistances being mixed around.I've always found the idea of a Light typing relatively silly because I've never seen any real potential in actual Pokemon concepts that could adopt it without it appearing forced. A fairy typing on the other hand could have some interesting potential, after all a fair number of Pokemon already have draw from similar mythos. (ie Chandelure and will-o-wisps) Plus in a franchise that's had Dragons, Ghosts, and Psychics since its inception I think it'd fit right in.I don't find it overwhelmingly likely, but I'd be open to the idea personally."
2013-04-22T20:24:32-0700,"Balance can sometimes be best if an odd number is used for variety's sake. (Ex: rock, paper, scissors)-If, (IF) they do decide to bring in a new type, I would hope they keep the type coverage an odd number, as I personally think that ""the odds"" are better in favor of completing a balanced circle so nothing is over powering.Now, as far as balanced goes: I think the balance of types is good as it sits- the issue I see being where the game is unbalanced is in the actual number of Pokemon in a specific type. Water Pokemon have the highest attendence, with Dragon type being short end of the deal.If anything: abilities, base stats, and the total number count for the types is where the balance needs to be adjusted.Take out the Legendaries and the mini legendaries, and what do you have for choices to know which Pokemon are battle worthy on a competitive level?Each Pokemon has a design and purpose for sure- all of them battle worthy in their own way. But, looking to add more balance to the video game will mean that IMO they should focus more on adding in Pokemon that will boost the numbers in the ""rarely played""/""never used"" types and add in some abilites to open the doors for more options.If Gamefreak has decided to add another type(s)- I might be a bit sad, honestly. I think that other areas of the Pokemon roster could use a great boost in adding more usable Pokemon for competitive levels of play.I would be happy with the games getting more of a restructure on the roster and ability side of Pokemon, but I am a bit iffy with a new type being added unless there is 2 new types. If so, I would hope that the less populated Pokemon types gain a severe gain in more higher quality base stated battle worthy Pokemon for the sake of adding in the needed balance."
2013-04-22T20:25:33-0700,I dont see whats wrong with a new type. It just adds more depth to the game. Why is that such a bad thing in peoples eyes?
2013-04-22T20:29:50-0700,"I think people think it is bad because of the lack of certain types.Notice in gen 1-2 there were only a few dark and steel types.Now everything I feel is playing a certain ""catch up"" being dual dark- or steel-something.I think if they did make a new type, a whole lot of balancing is in order, but that might enrage the fans a lot.Like if I were collecting electric type pokemon, and all of the sudden, rotom switched to light type...I'd probably pull all my hair out."
2013-04-22T20:33:37-0700,"I only own Red, Blue, Gold, Leafgreen.I might get back into the videogames just for the new mewtwo thing."
2013-04-22T20:36:43-0700,"@ Pokemontrader: Agreed to the idea of a Pokemon getting a new type. I can easily accept a new form, but, I do not think I would be cool with if, say, Dragonite suddently became a ""new type"".Original is original, change is good. But keeping the roots the same is a foundation that holds to what something is kept building upon and moving forward. Sure, repair and patch, but keep the original secure."
2013-04-22T20:46:02-0700,"The addition of adding Dark and Metal to the game did not unbalance it and felt needed. If give other types better or worse matchups. It also made for some unique pokemon designs and typing, also making things like hidden power more useful.The problem I see with adding a new type 650+ pokemon later is the new type would be pretty much exclusive to gen 6. I'm fairly confident that sylveon would be a normal types because it shares many traits with normal type pokemon but for argument sakes, lets say it is a new type and that type is light because I dont really consider ""fairy"" a type or element. Sylveon would be the only Pokemon in its type, until more are revealed. Lets say this light type has no bad match up or dark is its only bad matchup and that Pokemon has a based stat total of 600. That means the light type would be unbalanced because it has so few Pokemon that can fairly have a advantage against it.Adding a new type would create a issue unless they go back and redesign every other Pokemon for Gen 6, which we know they wont do because of their current track record with BW. I think they need to work on balancing the Pokemon first (increasing based stats on older Pokemon to compensate with power creep, make Flareon better to better support its 394 attack stat, etc) before adding new types to the game. Also changing some Pokemon types take away whats special to them."
2013-04-22T20:49:16-0700,"You're mistaken; inNeo Destinywe got 20 Pokémon with ""Light"" in their names, intended as a balance to the ""Dark"" Pokémon (not to be confused with Darkness-Types) that were originally introduced in theTeam Rocketexpansion and also featured inNeo Destiny.If you do not believe me, simply go to the Researching Tower, switch to the Unlimited version, and pull up theNeo Destinyset.The Type system in Pokémon is... odd. I can't tell if they started with classical elements and then started adding classical elements of other cultures, or if they just started adding things that struck their fancy, but the end result is that within a Type, a Pokémon can be that Type because:1) They manipulate that element2) They live in that element3) They are composed (partially or wholly) of that element4) More than one of the aboveThat applies to Types that resemble the elements... a Fighting-Type doesn't fit that; instead a Fighting-Type is apparently a Fighting-Type just because. Most are at least vaguely humanoid, but I can't even focus on what might be considered ""Fighting"" techniques or chi manipulation as there is too much overlap with other Types.It is just irksome that apparently knowing how to throw a karate chop (Fighting-Type) is equal to utilizing natural venoms (Poison-Type) is equal to channeling the power of the elements (anything resembling an elemental Type) is equal to tapping the power of the mind and soul is equal to having wings some of the time (Flying-Type).There are also Types that feel pretty redundant, like how we have Rock and Ground, which could have been an Earth-Type, possibly with Grass-Types. One also needs to realize that the Type system is pretty arbitrary to begin with, often using video game elemental logic instead of what would actually happen if equal/equivalent ""Types"" faced off."
2013-04-22T20:57:24-0700,"Really? You quote my post where I LINK to a light pokemon tcg card, and you STILL make a ridiculous statement?"
2013-04-22T21:22:06-0700,"@Otaku- don't forget Garbador! Plastic element! lol,"
2013-04-22T21:24:18-0700,"It's not as terrible as it can be but several things about it are really unbalanced. Steel resisting like twelve types is of course the obvious one, but I also hate how Poison is only strong against one type, seven types resist Grass, Ice has only one resistance, Dragon has a bunch of random elemental resistances and is only resisted by one type itself, and Water basically only has one actual weakness due to Grass being an undesirable offensive type/every Water Pokemon learning Ice Beam to combat them anyway.Personally I've always disagreed with the notion that Dark and Steel were necessary types for balance. Psychic was broken in RBY for a number of reasons that would have fixed themselves over time -- namely the fact that there were no Ghost moves (and a glitch in RBY made Psychic immune to Ghost-type moves anyway), no good Bug Pokemon nor Bug-type moves and the fact that Psychic caused a 30% Special drop when Special incorporated two different stats. They really didn't need to create specific types to just to nerf Psychics, especially when in the process they made Steel so ridiculously overpowered."
2013-04-22T23:22:04-0700,"Fairy Type eh? We don't even know what the possible new Pokemon Type's Weaknesses and Resistances are and If this new Type is going to be added to X & Y then it looks possible that the next generation of Pokemon games won't be backwards compatible with Black & White and Black 2 & White 2 which means that with that kind of a change in the game's core mechanics which are fine as is in Gen V then nobody will be able to migrate/transfer Pokemon to the new games this Fall. Worst case scenario would be that Game Freak adds new Stat statistics, new Natures, and Characteristics (IV's) in X & Y compared to it's predecessors which remained the same since Gen III that would cause another technological gap that happened from the transition of Gold, Silver, and Crystal to Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald which Game Freak made up for with FireRed and LeafGreen on the Gameboy Advance, I'm hoping they don't repeat that again. But then again this new Type hasn't been officially confirmed especially on Serebii.net or on PokeBeach so it could just be a rumor as of now.Some of you guys might think that the majority of players who play the Pokemon video games competitively don't EV/IV Train the natural way but instead they speed up the process by using cheating devices which would be illegal for official VGC Tournaments such as PokeSav and Action Replay to get perfect flawless stats on their entire team(s) however there's Pokemon players like myself who have spent 4-5 years EV and IV Training up to maybe 15-20+ Lv. 100 Pokemon for competitive battling whenever I get the chance to and for that effort to be wasted cause I wasn't able to migrate/transfer my EV/IV Trained Pokemon from BW2 to X&Y would be a huge slap in the face by Nintendo and Game Freak. I'm sure there will be some way to transfer since X&Y is on the 3DS just like BW2 yet it really depends on how much of the video game franchise's core mechanics are changed and If they're changed too much then a transfer won't be possible. Don't get the wrong idea that all competitive Pokemon players use cheating devices to get flawless teams in the Pokemon video games, I was just trying to make a point. I remember hearing Junichi Masuda say that Game Freak doesn't have any plans to get rid of being able to transfer Pokemon from Gen V to Gen VI in X&Y.Makes sense, Game Freak could nerf down Stealth Rocks since that makes alot of popular Fire-Types like Charizard and Flareon almost unplayable. Flareon can barely stand on it's own feet without getting screwed over by Earthquake, Scald, Surf, Water Pulse, and Stone Edge so it's kind of stuck having to survive by making Substitute's to absorb attacks unless you switch into something that resists Rock and Ground or is a Gliscor since it doesn't take that much damage from entry hazards and it also has Poison Heal which gets around Toxic Spikes. Out of all the entry hazards in competitive Pokemon video games, Stealth Rocks is the most commonly used, and with less Fire-Types played competitively aside from Infernape not very many players run Rapid Spin at all."
2013-04-23T00:19:33-0700,"My main gripe with Stealth Rocks is its ability to hit for weakness damage on the switch in, which is broken. Even other entry hazards dont target every Pokemon as some can absorb or are immune to them. Stealth Rock would be better if it did damage based on what leftovers could take. A Pokemon losing 25 to 50 percent of its health on a switch in just is not fair."
2013-04-23T10:54:15-0700,"Things like Entry Hazards and Weather teams have made the metagame stale over the last few years. The only way GameFreak can alter the metagame at this point is to nerf Entry Hazards and Weather abilities. Hopefully, Fairy can make the game fresh. Not only giving players more options to work with, but to have unique winning strategies if you know what I mean."
2013-04-23T14:44:31-0700,"Yeah its a little weird but why is thiis a big deal all of a sudden? Its always been that way and I never really thought anything of it since I dont get whats so bad about it. Its a little odd but its just how the game is.In Gen 2 there was only 6 of each since they were 1st introduced and Pokemon was still beginning really. Now theres dozens, Im sure in Xy the same thing will happen.And why would anyone care if Rotom was a light type? Its not like it doesnt make any sense. Nobody is going to stop playing because of that. They are just going to live with it and keep playing. Thats just being close minded to say ""oh well im not going to play anymore because they changed a type"". It sounds like a mindless complaint about a name change at best."
2013-04-23T15:11:48-0700,"It isn't ""suddenly a big deal"". First and foremost, it came up as an extension of the discussion. Second, it was an annoyance in Gen 1; the longer it remains, the more of a problem it becomes. The original games were on the original Game Boy; it was a very restrictive console to develop games for. The DS was no where near as limiting so there is no excuse for keeping such a cluttered system. When retaining a mechanic makes the game worse, usually a good idea to abandon it.Now, you say you don't get why it is so bad; fine. I don't know if I can adequately explain more than I already have without derailing thing. Not everyone takes issue with the same things."
2013-04-23T15:48:59-0700,"Its also a bigger deal because we are in the age of the internet. They have never released information on Pokemon like this before, just showing a image of it. For all we know, Sylveon is a normal type because to me, its has characteristics as wigglytuff. If it is a new type, it brings balance concerns. Why this is a big deal is because the VG has became recognizable to TPI and Pokemon is about taking Pokemon you like and training them to be their best. If this new type creates balance problems for VGC and limits the playing field. EX Pokemon are doing this to the TCG and the VG has been on a decline as well. What they should do is balance all 800+ pokemon."
2013-04-23T16:03:23-0700,[citation needed]It's not a fact just because you want it to be a fact.
2013-04-23T16:49:06-0700,"...Umm...yes...yes they have. Zekrom and Reshiram had unknown typings as did many fifth gen Pokemon upon their first reveal. The reason why Sylveon is subject to so much speculation is because it isn't immediately obvious and it breaks some of the traditional naming conventions to the eevee family, which could mean something...or not, only time will tell.There are two major reasons why I have a problem with this. One, not all Pokemon are intended to be competitive, the VGC is only a part of the franchises appeal, and some Pokemon have other intentions. (Stunfisk for instance was likely intended to be a fun joke) Two, if there is a new type why is the only option more unbalance? If they were to add Fairy it could be a great addition, sure there are concerns, but that comes with any change. Also it is your opinion that things are unbalanced and on the decline. Don't abuse declarative statements like that, I beg you."
2013-04-23T16:55:16-0700,"What I was getting at is EX Pokemon unbalance the TCG because it shows favoritism towards the EX Pokemon. ""regular"" Pokemon can't keep up with them and require more resources to get them going. Ex Pokemon are on their own level.I made the comparison between Pokemon EX and a new Pokemon type because of how poorly executed Pokemon EX were and if they add a new type to the game and it ends up being like EX and that new type of Pokemon ends up being really powerful, then it will unbalance the game because of how low their numbers are when you put them against 650+ other Pokemon.Sorry that I cant find you a source on this but no company will admit they poorly design or execute something. I also never said it was a fact. Its a observation I made from watching how they are treating BW."
2013-04-23T17:04:32-0700,"Thats all it is just my opinion. I feel like things are on the decline, which is also my opinion. Pokemon should have more value then just ultra rares. Again, Pokemon not being competitive is completely subjective. There is no fact that says that. That is your opinion and I respect that. You may think the game is good and that your opinion, I think its bad, my opinion.You two seem to think what I say is fact when its not. This is just a discussion and I will add to if. Everything here is speculation so everything will be based on opinion."
2013-04-23T17:07:26-0700,I'm just sayin...
2013-04-23T17:31:42-0700,"Its my opinion though, so I can say that. Other people are also making statements like that saying the game good. Dont be bias like that."
2013-04-23T17:52:16-0700,"I get that EX Pokemon are making the TCG bad but how would a new type make the VG bad? People play the VG on a Tier system, the community knows how to balance out the game pretty well. All 800 pokemon wouldnt get balanced (since pre-evolutions are just a means to an end) and I dont think Nintendo is going to go back and fix every Pokemon, so by nature some monsters are just going to be better than others.And why would a new type be that bad? I doubt a new type is going to dominate a Tier single handedly or dominate anything unless its just made really poorly."
2013-04-23T17:55:51-0700,"Let me reiterate myself. The problem is that most of your posts state your opinion as if it were a fact, thus it is a declarative statement, and it comes across as if you are saying your opinion is correct. You may not intend that, but that's a fairly simple interpretation of it. If you were to add something like 'I feel' or 'I think' more often your point might be more understood, as opposed to polarizing."
2013-04-23T18:02:42-0700,"Light and Dark Pokemon are ruining the game.Wait, no....Pokemon ex are ruining the game.Oh, hold on, new development....Pokemon SP are ruining the game.Oh, nope, sorry again, actually.....Pokemon Prime are ruining the game.What?!! Now, apparently....Pokemon EX are ruining the game guys.(Substitute appropriate VGC equivalents here, because i'm too lazy, something about weather, spin/haze, entry hazards, steel type, etc)"
2013-04-23T18:19:22-0700,"That just means I'm supporting my opinion. I'm not saying mine is correct, that's just how you take it."
2013-04-23T18:27:12-0700,"True but like I said before, we have no idea what this new Type's Weaknesses and Resistances are so this whole thread is just pure speculation at this point. Also adding a new Type like ""Fairy"" wouldn't be nearly as bad as allowing every Pokemon to know 6 moves at once instead of 4. Someone mentioned on this thread earlier that not all Pokemon are intended to be competitive and that's true and ironically enough there actually ways of making Pokemon that seem like they aren't competitive just by their looks into being competitive. I've seen a really good Lv. 100 Magikarp own an entire team of Legendaries on YouTube in Gen IV so that says alot."
2013-04-23T18:50:33-0700,"I hate that video so much. The guy sweeping was using competitive sets, while his opponent wasn't experienced enough to know how to deal with Smeargle."
2013-04-23T19:28:16-0700,"I don't recall that complaint. I am sure someone made it, but if we give every complaint equal standing without appreciation towards how common it actually was... you'll miss just getting stuck with my rants. :lol:"
2013-04-23T19:38:14-0700,"As that was many years ago, I couldn't tell you who said it, but it was common enough of a statement at my local league. It's very possible that it was only contained within central california, however, given that every other ""high end"" mechanic has been decried as ruining the game, I have no doubt there were very vocal complainers about the light and dark mechanic outside of my area as well."
2013-04-23T19:47:05-0700,Was it approaching it from the same direction?The big complaint about the Light Pokémon was... they were really bad. :lol: I don't recall most of the Dark Pokémon being all that good either. I do remember much complaining (at least some of it justified) about the Neo-era Baby Pokémon and several of the decks that did prove competitive.
2013-04-24T07:09:35-0700,"Have you never written a paper in your life? Supporting your opinion (your thesis in other words) is done by giving well-thought out andcitedfacts. Omitting the 'I think', 'I feel', or 'in my opinion' does not suddenly make your opinion stronger. No PhD in history has ever just worded their thesis as fact without giving strong supporting arguments based on fact, research, or study before. There's a reason for that.You can feel free to say that you're worried about VGC balancing issues, for example, by citing past occurences and their effects on the game, or even using public opinion, but just saying that something is, is very misleading."
2013-04-24T08:08:31-0700,"I write papers all the time. School is daamanding that of me right now and I score very high on them. Ive played in the vg and tcg since the very beginning,. Ive seen the game at its best and at its worst. I just dont speak without some knowledge or first hand experience about what im debating. What I have experience is enough for me to base my opinion on, right or wrong. I also dont have to cite any sources for ""the state of the tcg or vg"" because all sources related to competitive play will be bias. I support my opinion on events that happened. I dont have to I think or I feel. Do you have the skill to read inbetween the lines?The new Pokemon EX are very overpowered. They limit the card pool. without them, the game is better.Thats my opinion. You may not think so and thats fine. I think Stealth Rocks is overpowered and limits the pokemon that can be used. No Pokemon should lose 25 or 50 percent of its HP on a switch it. Thats my opinion and I do thinks its a strong one. You may think other wise and call it ""skill"". I also think my opinions are well-thoughtout. Again, I never anything I say is fact."
2013-04-24T08:20:33-0700,"Then, when you post such things, put words and phrases in there like ""IMO"" or ""I think"" or ""I believe"". It makes you sound less mean (I would use another word, but nannybot) and more open to engagement, rather than how closed off you make discussions at present."
2013-04-24T08:37:02-0700,"Im no more adament then others making their point. I know its a opinion, you should as well. Even when I do put in the keywords, most of you still argue about my opinions. I just stopped caring about be formal. Im going to say what I have to say about the topic if I have something to say a move on from there."
2013-04-24T08:40:09-0700,That's more to do with censorship than anything else I'd of thought.
2013-04-24T09:40:43-0700,What I know .. I hope a new type will make things more interesting (if there is a new type)
2013-04-24T10:33:22-0700,"I know only what is put in text. Nothing more, nothing less."
2013-04-24T11:03:34-0700,Then its not my fault when people can't tell when something is implied.
2013-04-24T11:16:06-0700,Actually it is.So don't imply. You change an implication into an overt declaration when you add the simple tags to your sentence as Bullados has suggested.
2013-04-24T13:07:20-0700,"I work in the business world; of course I can read between the lines. That isn't the point. The point is that the way you write comes off as extremely closed-minded (I'm not the first to tell you this) and as not open for feedback or criticism. That's a problem when people are having a discussion which comes with give and take and an open acceptance of new ideas and theories. No one is correct, and no one is wrong. This is all what we think. But you make it seem like you're right and no one else is..."
2013-04-24T14:11:07-0700,"Most things considered ""facts"" are just other peoples opinions. Sometimes its a joke whats considered a thesis since its just a large collection of other peoples opinions. The only reason its regarded as ""credible"" is because those people are of higher authority, but realistically half the things they say are no different than you or me.Putting in those phrases is a waste of time since you have to assume what everyone says is an opinion unless its some sort of common knowledge.Either way what does any of this have to do with Pokemon?"
2013-04-24T14:16:11-0700,"The statements I make are up for debate, which makes them a opinion. I support them with what I think makes sense. If you want to counter it, then fine. If I can counter back then I would. Please explain how I make it seem I'm right and everyone else is wrong? To me, I'm just debating with what I know based on past events as I never once said ""this is fact"". I dont know what they are doing, its why this thread exist so people can debate what they thinkhappen.Sorry if you think I'm hard to debate with but you're going to have to deal with that. Its no different when you debate your points with others as well.There are many other sources that do not list ""IMO"", ""I Think"" or ""I believe"" when they make things knows. For example on a smaller scale; top 10 list, worst Pokemon gen, best Pokemon gen, best game, worst game and on a larger scale, The NRA, religion and other political organizations which are largely biased push their agendas as if they were fact, yet they dont use ""IMO"", ""I Think"" or ""I believe"" because andsince its such a big deal, they just dont make points look decidable. If you cant read in between the lines or be able to tell when a opinion is being stated, then I'm dont know what to say."
2013-04-24T15:55:36-0700,A little nitpick on that religion point...
2013-04-24T15:57:02-0700,Emphasisadded.I think you just defeated your own point. Most of the groups you just cited only refer to their views as opinions to be polite or to avoid potential litigation. Otherwise most consider their views to be factual; indeed I would question any religion where the adherents didn't consider the basic tenets of the faith to be factual as what good are reality defining beliefs that no one actually believes?
2013-04-24T18:18:22-0700,There's a huge difference between me saying 'I think being overweight leads to heart disease' and me writing a thesis with several studies and legitimate research done on the topic to prove it. A thesis has a LOT more proof than a sentence stating someone's opinion.
2013-04-24T18:27:40-0700,"@immewnity Fair enough but the people I know about, they make it know there is only one God with no other possibilities.@Otaku A good point as well. Those groups are extremely biased. Nothing they really say is a fact, just a group of people who share a same opinion yet they treat it as if it were fact. I used though groups to prove a point. I forgot to put PETA and extremist on the list. While they don't use ""keywords"" to make their points obvious but they stand firm with their opinions. I'm just one person with a opinion. While my opinion is made stronger if other people share the same views, my opinion is on its own as a observation is still valid.I was basically supporting my own opinion with what I thought was a strong argument. If others need keywords to identify a opinion, then that is their short coming, not mine. Then all of a sudden people want me to cite sources that validate my claim. I don't have one because all sources are biased about if the game is good or not. I've played many formats, both I deemed good and bad and have watched the power creep the video games went through. I have my opinion about the game state just like any other.I challenge anyone to find me a official source from Pokemon that says ""not all Pokemon were created to be competitive"", since citing became important all of a sudden because competitive is subjective. Fine me a official source saying ""We know the TCG is in a good or bad state"" from Pokemon. The big difference between me and very opinionated organizations is they have WAY more people following them then I do."
2013-04-24T18:34:59-0700,"Thats backed by facts, research and scientist who can validate it. The Pokemon TCG and VG do not have facts backed by research so when we speak on it, its people who speak on what they think may change with the game. Nothing is factual with Pokemon until Pokemon makes it so.It was almost a universal know thing that Sabldonk was bad for the game and would have ruined the next large tournament. Nations and Worlds I think. They released a statement say The next format would be HGSS on for that tournament to keep the game balanced, in a nutshell.We can't compare Pokemon, that has no official backing on what is until it happens with Heart Disease which is back by research."
2013-04-24T20:30:11-0700,"Plus not all scientific ""facts"" end up always being true, half the time it really is just opinion.

2013-04-26T17:13:33-0700,"Just so you know, somewhere, deep down in my heart, I still love you.YEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"
2013-04-27T05:20:41-0700,I'd vote for a Lunar or Planar type of Pokemon. So many of these guys seem to be from outer space anyway.
2013-04-27T12:30:09-0700,"Wow, that is on topic and actually makes at least as much sense as the existing types. I could appreciate such a Type myself."
2013-04-27T13:23:40-0700,"The amount of play testing for adding in a new Type- has anyone consdiered this aspect?Balance among the Types vs balance of the sheer numbers of Pokemon in a type- I would chose to go with adding in more Pokemon to the existing Types we have for the sake of variety.We could see more new attacks as well, since IMO there are some types that could use a better boost in more powerfull attacks or gimmicks."
2013-04-27T13:54:48-0700,Can of what I was saying. They would need to balance this new type to work with over 650 Pokemon and their existing types.
2013-04-29T04:54:27-0700,"Not sure if it's important to balance pokemon at the moment or not. Honestly I can't see how bringing in a new type would be worth reworking all current pokemon. If it was me and I HAD to bring in a new type, I'd just work it into current scheme of things to try to slightly balance things out more. However, since I'm just a player, the only opinion of mine that counts is as a consumer. Personally I'm not fond of their record so far in terms of introducing new types - in both the VG and TCG. Not that I'd have them taken away of course, but most of their introductions in both games have been gimmicky, mostly awkward, and somewhat painful. I hope they don't introduce a new type. However, I'd continue to play the VG regardless."
2013-04-23T14:44:31-0700,"Yeah its a little weird but why is thiis a big deal all of a sudden? Its always been that way and I never really thought anything of it since I dont get whats so bad about it. Its a little odd but its just how the game is.In Gen 2 there was only 6 of each since they were 1st introduced and Pokemon was still beginning really. Now theres dozens, Im sure in Xy the same thing will happen.And why would anyone care if Rotom was a light type? Its not like it doesnt make any sense. Nobody is going to stop playing because of that. They are just going to live with it and keep playing. Thats just being close minded to say ""oh well im not going to play anymore because they changed a type"". It sounds like a mindless complaint about a name change at best."
2013-04-23T15:11:48-0700,"It isn't ""suddenly a big deal"". First and foremost, it came up as an extension of the discussion. Second, it was an annoyance in Gen 1; the longer it remains, the more of a problem it becomes. The original games were on the original Game Boy; it was a very restrictive console to develop games for. The DS was no where near as limiting so there is no excuse for keeping such a cluttered system. When retaining a mechanic makes the game worse, usually a good idea to abandon it.Now, you say you don't get why it is so bad; fine. I don't know if I can adequately explain more than I already have without derailing thing. Not everyone takes issue with the same things."
2013-04-23T15:48:59-0700,"Its also a bigger deal because we are in the age of the internet. They have never released information on Pokemon like this before, just showing a image of it. For all we know, Sylveon is a normal type because to me, its has characteristics as wigglytuff. If it is a new type, it brings balance concerns. Why this is a big deal is because the VG has became recognizable to TPI and Pokemon is about taking Pokemon you like and training them to be their best. If this new type creates balance problems for VGC and limits the playing field. EX Pokemon are doing this to the TCG and the VG has been on a decline as well. What they should do is balance all 800+ pokemon."
2013-04-23T16:03:23-0700,[citation needed]It's not a fact just because you want it to be a fact.
2013-04-23T16:49:06-0700,"...Umm...yes...yes they have. Zekrom and Reshiram had unknown typings as did many fifth gen Pokemon upon their first reveal. The reason why Sylveon is subject to so much speculation is because it isn't immediately obvious and it breaks some of the traditional naming conventions to the eevee family, which could mean something...or not, only time will tell.There are two major reasons why I have a problem with this. One, not all Pokemon are intended to be competitive, the VGC is only a part of the franchises appeal, and some Pokemon have other intentions. (Stunfisk for instance was likely intended to be a fun joke) Two, if there is a new type why is the only option more unbalance? If they were to add Fairy it could be a great addition, sure there are concerns, but that comes with any change. Also it is your opinion that things are unbalanced and on the decline. Don't abuse declarative statements like that, I beg you."
2013-04-23T16:55:16-0700,"What I was getting at is EX Pokemon unbalance the TCG because it shows favoritism towards the EX Pokemon. ""regular"" Pokemon can't keep up with them and require more resources to get them going. Ex Pokemon are on their own level.I made the comparison between Pokemon EX and a new Pokemon type because of how poorly executed Pokemon EX were and if they add a new type to the game and it ends up being like EX and that new type of Pokemon ends up being really powerful, then it will unbalance the game because of how low their numbers are when you put them against 650+ other Pokemon.Sorry that I cant find you a source on this but no company will admit they poorly design or execute something. I also never said it was a fact. Its a observation I made from watching how they are treating BW."
2013-04-23T17:04:32-0700,"Thats all it is just my opinion. I feel like things are on the decline, which is also my opinion. Pokemon should have more value then just ultra rares. Again, Pokemon not being competitive is completely subjective. There is no fact that says that. That is your opinion and I respect that. You may think the game is good and that your opinion, I think its bad, my opinion.You two seem to think what I say is fact when its not. This is just a discussion and I will add to if. Everything here is speculation so everything will be based on opinion."
2013-04-23T17:07:26-0700,I'm just sayin...
2013-04-23T17:31:42-0700,"Its my opinion though, so I can say that. Other people are also making statements like that saying the game good. Dont be bias like that."
2013-04-23T17:52:16-0700,"I get that EX Pokemon are making the TCG bad but how would a new type make the VG bad? People play the VG on a Tier system, the community knows how to balance out the game pretty well. All 800 pokemon wouldnt get balanced (since pre-evolutions are just a means to an end) and I dont think Nintendo is going to go back and fix every Pokemon, so by nature some monsters are just going to be better than others.And why would a new type be that bad? I doubt a new type is going to dominate a Tier single handedly or dominate anything unless its just made really poorly."
2013-04-23T17:55:51-0700,"Let me reiterate myself. The problem is that most of your posts state your opinion as if it were a fact, thus it is a declarative statement, and it comes across as if you are saying your opinion is correct. You may not intend that, but that's a fairly simple interpretation of it. If you were to add something like 'I feel' or 'I think' more often your point might be more understood, as opposed to polarizing."
2013-04-23T18:02:42-0700,"Light and Dark Pokemon are ruining the game.Wait, no....Pokemon ex are ruining the game.Oh, hold on, new development....Pokemon SP are ruining the game.Oh, nope, sorry again, actually.....Pokemon Prime are ruining the game.What?!! Now, apparently....Pokemon EX are ruining the game guys.(Substitute appropriate VGC equivalents here, because i'm too lazy, something about weather, spin/haze, entry hazards, steel type, etc)"
2013-04-23T18:19:22-0700,"That just means I'm supporting my opinion. I'm not saying mine is correct, that's just how you take it."
2013-04-23T18:27:12-0700,"True but like I said before, we have no idea what this new Type's Weaknesses and Resistances are so this whole thread is just pure speculation at this point. Also adding a new Type like ""Fairy"" wouldn't be nearly as bad as allowing every Pokemon to know 6 moves at once instead of 4. Someone mentioned on this thread earlier that not all Pokemon are intended to be competitive and that's true and ironically enough there actually ways of making Pokemon that seem like they aren't competitive just by their looks into being competitive. I've seen a really good Lv. 100 Magikarp own an entire team of Legendaries on YouTube in Gen IV so that says alot."
2013-04-23T18:50:33-0700,"I hate that video so much. The guy sweeping was using competitive sets, while his opponent wasn't experienced enough to know how to deal with Smeargle."
2013-04-23T19:28:16-0700,"I don't recall that complaint. I am sure someone made it, but if we give every complaint equal standing without appreciation towards how common it actually was... you'll miss just getting stuck with my rants. :lol:"
2013-04-23T19:38:14-0700,"As that was many years ago, I couldn't tell you who said it, but it was common enough of a statement at my local league. It's very possible that it was only contained within central california, however, given that every other ""high end"" mechanic has been decried as ruining the game, I have no doubt there were very vocal complainers about the light and dark mechanic outside of my area as well."
2013-04-23T19:47:05-0700,Was it approaching it from the same direction?The big complaint about the Light Pokémon was... they were really bad. :lol: I don't recall most of the Dark Pokémon being all that good either. I do remember much complaining (at least some of it justified) about the Neo-era Baby Pokémon and several of the decks that did prove competitive.
2013-04-24T07:09:35-0700,"Have you never written a paper in your life? Supporting your opinion (your thesis in other words) is done by giving well-thought out andcitedfacts. Omitting the 'I think', 'I feel', or 'in my opinion' does not suddenly make your opinion stronger. No PhD in history has ever just worded their thesis as fact without giving strong supporting arguments based on fact, research, or study before. There's a reason for that.You can feel free to say that you're worried about VGC balancing issues, for example, by citing past occurences and their effects on the game, or even using public opinion, but just saying that something is, is very misleading."
2013-04-24T08:08:31-0700,"I write papers all the time. School is daamanding that of me right now and I score very high on them. Ive played in the vg and tcg since the very beginning,. Ive seen the game at its best and at its worst. I just dont speak without some knowledge or first hand experience about what im debating. What I have experience is enough for me to base my opinion on, right or wrong. I also dont have to cite any sources for ""the state of the tcg or vg"" because all sources related to competitive play will be bias. I support my opinion on events that happened. I dont have to I think or I feel. Do you have the skill to read inbetween the lines?The new Pokemon EX are very overpowered. They limit the card pool. without them, the game is better.Thats my opinion. You may not think so and thats fine. I think Stealth Rocks is overpowered and limits the pokemon that can be used. No Pokemon should lose 25 or 50 percent of its HP on a switch it. Thats my opinion and I do thinks its a strong one. You may think other wise and call it ""skill"". I also think my opinions are well-thoughtout. Again, I never anything I say is fact."
2013-04-24T08:20:33-0700,"Then, when you post such things, put words and phrases in there like ""IMO"" or ""I think"" or ""I believe"". It makes you sound less mean (I would use another word, but nannybot) and more open to engagement, rather than how closed off you make discussions at present."
2013-04-24T08:37:02-0700,"Im no more adament then others making their point. I know its a opinion, you should as well. Even when I do put in the keywords, most of you still argue about my opinions. I just stopped caring about be formal. Im going to say what I have to say about the topic if I have something to say a move on from there."
2013-04-24T08:40:09-0700,That's more to do with censorship than anything else I'd of thought.
2013-04-24T09:40:43-0700,What I know .. I hope a new type will make things more interesting (if there is a new type)

2013-04-24T11:03:34-0700,Then its not my fault when people can't tell when something is implied.
2013-04-24T11:16:06-0700,Actually it is.So don't imply. You change an implication into an overt declaration when you add the simple tags to your sentence as Bullados has suggested.
2013-04-24T13:07:20-0700,"I work in the business world; of course I can read between the lines. That isn't the point.

2013-04-27T05:20:41-0700,I'd vote for a Lunar or Planar type of Pokemon. So many of these guys seem to be from outer space anyway.
2013-04-27T12:30:09-0700,"Wow, that is on topic and actually makes at least as much sense as the existing types. I could appreciate such a Type myself."
2013-04-27T13:23:40-0700,"The amount of play testing for adding in a new Type- has anyone consdiered this aspect?Balance among the Types vs balance of the sheer numbers of Pokemon in a type- I would chose to go with adding in more Pokemon to the existing Types we have for the sake of variety.We could see more new attacks as well, since IMO there are some types that could use a better boost in more powerfull attacks or gimmicks."
2013-04-27T13:54:48-0700,Can of what I was saying. They would need to balance this new type to work with over 650 Pokemon and their existing types.
2013-04-29T04:54:27-0700,"Not sure if it's important to balance pokemon at the moment or not. Honestly I can't see how bringing in a new type would be worth reworking all current pokemon. If it was me and I HAD to bring in a new type, I'd just work it into current scheme of things to try to slightly balance things out more. However, since I'm just a player, the only opinion of mine that counts is as a consumer. Personally I'm not fond of their record so far in terms of introducing new types - in both the VG and TCG. Not that I'd have them taken away of course, but most of their introductions in both games have been gimmicky, mostly awkward, and somewhat painful. I hope they don't introduce a new type. However, I'd continue to play the VG regardless."

2013-04-17T18:18:04-0700,"With 6th Gen coming out, so far one Pokemon has been confirmed to have a new form, Mewtwo.What about Dugtrio? Or Shuckle?With so many opinions on Pokemon that should evolve or take on a new form, which would you choose?What do you all think? Which one and why?"
2013-04-18T22:39:19-0700,"While legendaries with ""forms"" has been played out to the point where it hurts, before Gen 4 started the craze, I was really hoping for Heatran to get a new form. It was the only legendary to be random with its gender, and it always seemed both mysterious and held back. I was waiting for a pure fire offensive magma boss form. Instead, we got a grass reindeer xDManaphy might be cool too. Another Gen 4 Pokemon that was just strange, with its connection to Phione. Although I dont have any idea what tis form would be like."
2013-04-21T13:26:19-0700,Deoxys - cuz 4 forms aren't enough .... in my books.
2013-04-22T20:55:53-0700,"I wonder if Deoxys was intented to be only one of the forms, or it was an after thought to give it so many forms in the first place. (sigh, research! lol)Forms is cool and all to me, it did bring a different direction with options to the battle field for sure. (unfortunitly, most of the Pokemon that have multiple forms are banned from the comp scene) (and no, Ditto does not count, lol)With some exceptions, appearence is one thing, to have a new form to make use of changing the Pokemon's base stats is sort of cool in that it can open the door to more of a competitive stratagy rather then having to solely rely on the appearence factor to make a difference in how a POkemon can battle. Like, a shiny Pokemon does not have any special advantage over a non shiny POkemon for example."
2013-04-23T03:27:18-0700,"To change things up a bit, I'd like to see pokemon that can only use specific move sets when they have a specific form .... like for example say a pokemon has 2 forms, one of which has a tail. If it uses the opposite form, it loses the ability to use Iron Tail, but gains something else - like maybe Dynamic Punch. If you could switch back and forth and automaticly change the moveset without teaching a new TM, that would be cool."
2013-04-23T06:42:16-0700,So rotom? :biggrin:
2013-04-23T10:55:45-0700,"Seriously? Rotom can do that? Man, I'm missing out obviously. Ok where do I get one?edit: Mind you, it would be nice if the pokemon was also tournament worthy as well."
2013-04-23T13:43:09-0700,The Rotom line does have a good battle worthy form set for competitive play. When you change the type of Rotom's form- they will have a move replaced with a different move that will match/compliment the form you opt to change it into.
2013-04-24T05:54:43-0700,"Well since Pokemon X/Y is about genetics (See also both of the new forms for Mewtwo, a genetically altered pokemon) I am sure Deoxys will have some part in the spotlight in this game, but I don't think it will be a new form but rather an exclusive story path like they did with Celebi in HeartGold/SoulSilver."

2013-02-14T17:20:41-0800,"[gal=54441]Sylveon[/gal]The Pokémon Company International is announcing a new Pokémon that will appear for the first time in Pokémon X and Pokémon Y this October. The new Pokémon, Sylveon, is a new evolution of Eevee, one of the most beloved Pokémon since it was first discovered in Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue. Players with Eevee can evolve it into one of seven evolutions, like Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Flareon. Sylveon will be the eighth Eevee evolution.More details about this new Pokémon and how it evolves from Eevee will be shared later this year."
2013-02-15T09:59:06-0800,"Yep, i have been expecting a new eeveelution this gen. not quite sure what type it will be, kinda leaning towards normal type, lets just hope it gets decent stats in good stats. and i wonder if there will be more eeveelutions announced, and how we will evolve them~Jake"
2013-02-15T11:51:49-0800,A night's rest and I believe it'll be flying type. The way it's things sway in the wind just makes me think of flying.
2013-03-14T20:19:26-0700,"I wonder if they're going to introduce a new type. It looks to me like a normal type, but I heard something about it being something called a 'light' type. New eeveelutions and new types? Cool..."
2013-03-15T11:58:37-0700,"To me it seems its going to be a Normal type. Its pink like most Normal type and it has a bunch of bows and ribbons. I think the evolution conditions are going to be winning contest.At this point in the game, adding a new type would create balance issues."
2013-03-16T08:42:48-0700,Didn't May have an Eevee in which she did contests with? That would be epic of May came back and she had this new Pokemon.
2013-03-16T11:54:51-0700,That would be cool.
2013-03-16T22:08:39-0700,She already came back and it was a Glaceon. She competed in the Wallace Cup in Sinnoh with it.

I've had some conversations with friends on this subject - playing singles the metagame is a bit different but I've felt like Fighting- and Bug-types are too prevalent for their own good right now. Adding a new type would help make the one-of addition make more sense, and might offer a chance to make the metagame more interesting again!...or, not. I dunno. It doesn't feel like a Normal-type to me."
2013-03-19T15:31:11-0700,"With over 700 Pokemon pre X/Y, making a new type would unbalance the game. The cycle of weakness and resistances are perfect the way they are. Its also not that rare for a Pokemon to evolve into their own type. With the way Eevee is suppose to evolve, it evolving into a normal type seems possible. Eevee evolves to adapt. If it does not need to adapt, like a sheltered Eevee, then it evolving into a normal type works."

2013-02-14T17:20:41-0800,"[gal=54441]Sylveon[/gal]The Pokémon Company International is announcing a new Pokémon that will appear for the first time in Pokémon X and Pokémon Y this October. The new Pokémon, Sylveon, is a new evolution of Eevee, one of the most beloved Pokémon since it was first discovered in Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue. Players with Eevee can evolve it into one of seven evolutions, like Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Flareon. Sylveon will be the eighth Eevee evolution.More details about this new Pokémon and how it evolves from Eevee will be shared later this year."
2013-02-15T09:59:06-0800,"Yep, i have been expecting a new eeveelution this gen. not quite sure what type it will be, kinda leaning towards normal type, lets just hope it gets decent stats in good stats. and i wonder if there will be more eeveelutions announced, and how we will evolve them~Jake"
2013-02-15T11:51:49-0800,A night's rest and I believe it'll be flying type. The way it's things sway in the wind just makes me think of flying.
2013-03-14T20:19:26-0700,"I wonder if they're going to introduce a new type. It looks to me like a normal type, but I heard something about it being something called a 'light' type. New eeveelutions and new types? Cool..."
2013-03-15T11:58:37-0700,"To me it seems its going to be a Normal type. Its pink like most Normal type and it has a bunch of bows and ribbons. I think the evolution conditions are going to be winning contest.At this point in the game, adding a new type would create balance issues."
2013-03-16T08:42:48-0700,Didn't May have an Eevee in which she did contests with? That would be epic of May came back and she had this new Pokemon.
2013-03-16T11:54:51-0700,That would be cool.
2013-03-16T22:08:39-0700,She already came back and it was a Glaceon. She competed in the Wallace Cup in Sinnoh with it.

2013-03-25T14:34:32-0700,Has anyone heard of promo Pokemon for the release of X/Y (kind of like Genesect and Victini for the last generation)
2013-03-28T23:08:16-0700,Nope. Not sure if they will have a promo download Pokemon right away. I believe they will rely mostly on the fact that the games are brand spanking new and that it is 6th generation. They won't need to promote a download/event Pokemon for this series. Just an opinion is all.
2013-03-29T15:51:35-0700,"Thanks, but I'm curious as to why that didn't apply to Generation V, especially because it was the last set for DS."
2013-03-29T16:55:20-0700,"More then likely for the fact that moving onto the 3DS for the series: they opted out in development/conversion to not promote ""older"" systems. If that makes sence. Promotions/DLC and the sort are to keep with the technololgy times. Time frames of how long a system will be the ""front runner supporter"" for a system, they do not really ""reverse"" the support. If they believe they are say for example 3 years away from a system upgrade, they are more apt to provide event Pokemon for what is current and to keep the games moving forward. Somethings like compatability between the systems are an issue, one of the main keys to passing from one system to the next. Example: old cable connections vs infrared, and now both infrared and wi-fi.Sure, it is a money making ""ploy"", but, not every one is satisfied with ""older technology"". Plus, being able to have more interaction between gamers is more sought after then being restricted. When gen 6 hits the scene, the chances of having Event Pokemon that are far and between the gen's as far as access to having them will more then be the best bet for any Event Pokemon after the release of 6th gen.Can't catch them all if the system and games take way to much of a hassle to get them all onto one game.The other factor is obtaining certain Pokemon and the requirments/means of method on getting them legitimitly. I am sure that 6th gen will not only be a serious up-grade with new Pokemon, but an all around more improved method of being able to have access to all the Pokemon, past and present.I really can't ""offically"" say that this is all for truthfulness, but some thoughts as to why things are done the way they are based on the history of the games and the patterns of how Event Pokemon and promotional stuff goes.6th gen will sell itself, and any promotional stuff will be geared towards the ""hype"", and if anything goes for Event Pokemon, you will need to consider the amount of work involved in having the option to catch them all.Manaphy might be a good canidate to be an Event Pokemon after the release of 6th gen due to what, the one chance to obtain it legit how many years back?,Based on that thought, after 6th gen is released, the sales dwindle down after the holidays and the new year- we might see Manaphy being an optional Event DL to draw in any last ""undecided"" gamers to boost sales a bit more.So, last thoughts: Because the X/Y games are being released world wide at the same time, no country will have an advantage over another and any Event Pokemon they plan to allow for DL will tie in any lose ends on the availibilty of legit Pokemon, and be a part of the story line in the game as added content. This keeps the game's playability a stronger factor for players not becoming board or letting the games go stale.A great amount of what I just said is a business minded line of reasoning, and from a personal gamers point of view. Between now and the release of 6th gen- I would hope an increase in Event Pokemon becoming available for the ease of transitition over to the X/Y game carts and not leaving to much behind from the the work and time placed into my collection of having a full legit Pokedex."

2013-03-10T16:22:02-0700,Can you use PP UPs to incease the pp of a move for tournaments such as regionals and nationals?
2013-03-10T16:27:35-0700,yes. a very common strategy.
2013-03-11T00:12:11-0700,"I highly recomending using PP Up for tournies. Sometimes certain moves will need the extra boost in count- as some battles, opposing attacks, abilities, and the chance of missing can reduce your chances to hit hard when your needing to. Attacks like Fire Blast will be better having 8 vs 5 in a battle, just in case for the reasons I stated. IMO, an Attack with 15 PP doesn't need the boost, some 10 PP Attacks might, and less then 10 should have the boost. If in the case of your Move set for the build for weather like Sunny Day, I see no reason to boost those.Just weigh your Move needs as to how much of a boost you need for a battle, consider how long the battle might last and judge how much to boost the PP count."

2013-03-09T10:07:34-0800,How do I ensure that my Tornadus i caught on the dream radar has a good nature? Is there a SR trick to make sure it has a good nature like with event or legendary pokemon?
2013-03-09T17:39:27-0800,SR doesnt work on the Radar mons. you could backup your save data from Radar and keep reloading it onto your sd card to keep sending your torn-t till it is the nature you want.
2013-03-09T19:13:37-0800,"This is half true.Once you transfer over a legendary (Tornadus/Luga/Whatever) you cannot receive another one on that Black2/White2 save file.You can backup your Dream Radar save on the SD card, but you will have to restart your Black2/White2 save game to download a new one."
2013-03-10T13:20:51-0700,So really you have to be super lucky or put in a good amount of hours (restarting BW2 until you get the nature).

2013-02-18T01:52:05-0800,"Just an idea here, but what do you all think about this:Once a month (maybe twice a month) I select 2 Pokemon to ""face off"" in a battle and you all get to ""build"" one of the Pokemon to defeat the other Pokemon it is facing off against.Example:Mewtwo vs Genesect.I will post both Pokemon according to each of the Pokemon's base stats.You will need to select one of the two and ""build"" the Pokemon to defeat the other by way of move set and where you would like to place the Effort Points.At the end of the time frame that your allowed to post in favor of one of the two Pokemon, the Pokemon with the most post's in favor of winning will be declaired the winner of that round.What do you all think?"
2013-02-18T02:07:37-0800,"I kinda like it. Ultimate Predator or Ultimate Warrior kinda thing, Pokemon style.If we wanted to make it an official sort of thing I would love to bring all the expertise I've got to the table! I mean, this would by definition be a 1v1/singles kind of situation... that's what I do best..."
2013-02-18T02:32:19-0800,"^yeah. I think this would work as a way to get players to understand ""building"" a Pokemon and knowing what it is facing in the battle. Even though one is not ""built"", your building one to purposefully defeat the other by way of having to make up for what it's weaknesses are base stat wise, but to have an advantage move set wise for offense.I don't know exactly yet how I want to set it up- just looking to see if there is even an interest base in this is all.*Side note* Mewtwo will win, hands down, lol! (hay, one of my faves and own personal opinion- lol- plus: I am Team R after all)"
2013-02-18T07:41:44-0800,I like the idea. Its gonna be a Pokemon Showdown!!!!!!!! XD
2013-02-18T07:57:16-0800,Its a cool idea but I dont have mewtwo or gensect :frown::nonono:
2013-02-18T10:34:25-0800,"If we adhere too much to some idea of sticking the two Pokemon in a pure 1v1 battle, it'd be kinda boring - in the Mewtwo vs Genesect thing, Mewtwo autowins cause it has higher base Speed and you can just give it hidden power fire or something. We wouldn't want to actually perform counterbuilds too much, until we know really what we're judging on/what the criteria are and what the contest is. Speed really determines a lot about a matchup between two Pokemon, but when Speed isn't the deciding factor it's usually something else small - like a type advantage over coverage moves, or just enough sheer tankiness and the power to respond in kind."
2013-02-18T11:08:20-0800,Would you factor in things like if a Pokemon can fly and what not?
2013-02-18T13:49:26-0800,^Not sure yet how the mechanics of all of it will be. Thus as an idea and reaching out to every one is to try to figure out a system so we can show the strengths of a Pokemon is all.
2013-02-18T17:38:38-0800,"IMO, this should go more off the ""lore"" behind the two rather than actual mechanics, like say an anime-style fight. Otherwise like Kayle said, Mewtwo is just going to barbeque Genesect with Flamethrower or something."
2013-02-18T21:55:13-0800,"I guarantee I will beat any Mewtwo with Genesect in a real 1v1 battle, against anyone. Someone up for it? No hacks of course."
2013-02-18T22:14:16-0800,I would really like to know how. Mewtwo should win if they are both on even play grounds. Is there something I don't know.
2013-02-18T23:36:21-0800,"Interesting............ see- this is what I am talking about. I also like the idea of ""lore"" being a part of this idea.I do see/know a way for Genesect to defeat Mewtwo.......therefore a good reason to look into how this idea can become an optional activity on here for comparisons against/between Pokemon."
2013-02-18T23:47:53-0800,"PM me your strategy for this because I'm 100% positive there exists at least one Mewtwo set that I can mathematically guarantee will beat literally any Genesect in a pure 1v1, without baton pass or any other additional setup.On one hand, the fact that I can say that kind of defeats the purpose of this idea [in terms of just pure game mechanics] - but on the other, if Pablo's actually on to something, then maybe we've got a lot more to talk about than I thought.While the lore is an interesting place to turn, we don't really have any way to generate statistics for any given Pokemon's power except through the game, which is a lot of the fun of the TV shows of a similar theme - that they actually do all this research and can show you comprehensively how tough these warriors/animals/etc are. I don't think Pokemon is too interested in maintaining a coherent canonical hierarchy."
2013-02-18T23:56:37-0800,"In these type of death matches, we have to put all contenders on common ground. For this it would be the same EV spreads, relate-able items and same items, natures, etc. If He is talking about a Choice Scarf set, we'll also have to put Mewtwo on a scarf as well. If he's talking about super effective reduction items to score a KO on Mewtwo, we'll also have give one to Mewtwo. Mewtwo should win against it in almost all setups because of flamethrower/fire blast. The speed advantage is the biggest weapon Mewtwo has and Genosects 4x weakness to fire does him no justice.We'll have to use all of Mewtwos strengths against all of Genosects strengths and put them on a plain thats not I attack first and then you. Mewtwo is smart so he'll find a way I'm sure."
2013-02-19T01:06:28-0800,"Well I'm talking purely mechanics of the actual video games here, not Pokemon lore. Anyways it's really not that complicated. A mas SP A Bug Buzz is almost always a guaranteed OHKO on any Mewtwo without SpD/HP EV's invested into it (standard Speed/SpA) and so holding a Focus Sash, Genesect would always win due to the priority move it learns (Quick Attack) as Mewtwo learns none.A Bug attack reducing berry would nullify this, as even if the Genesect could be physical based and used Bug Bite instead, to nullify such item, it will not be able to finish off Mewtwo after a Bug Bite + a Quick Attack, so I guess went ahead of myself. I didn't know Genesects base stats before my last post and have now found out both it's SpA and Att base stats are lackluster for an 'uber'.Oh well, would've been fun to see people try anything other than the berry and be surprised when they were ko'd by a Quick Attack."

(fictious VG talk)That kind of stuff can get old quickly and in my opinion takes the fun out of it.

Venusaur can use Sleep Power or all kinds of Powders to slow down Charizard, but Charizard could use his wings to blow the powders scattered across the air away. On a sunny day, both Charizard and Venusaur feel strong, with Venusaur being able to shoot constant Solar Beams, but Charizard can dodge them in the air and deliver the final Flame Blast for the KO.See what a little imagination can produce?

Thus, Kingdra loses 10 Hit Points.Players will then need to defend or continue the attacks onto the same Pokemon until One is Knocked Out.There is room for imagination here, and also to use specific attacks that they learn in the games.I am not sure, but this is just a though.

2013-02-22T16:46:05-0800,"Perhaps have a best of 3 match between the Pokemon in the Anime, the TCG, and the Video Game. Whoever wins 2 or more of the matches wins the whole thing.

2013-02-22T16:49:53-0800,"Combining all 3 aspects would be cool to make a battle game sort of thing.I am still tossing around ideas in my head, so- not sure of a full result for this idea and the mechanics.I am liking the feed back and ideas coming in though. Keep them coming!"
2013-02-22T22:26:11-0800,Anime seems hardest to do so I'd start discussing that first
2013-02-22T23:58:40-0800,"^ Agreed if Anime is considered. I would need to research the episodes that have Pokemon in them (Or the Movies)-and the Anime magazines.I am not all that familure with Magazine/comic book anime, but it should be rather easy to find episodes to get some ideas for info."
2013-02-23T11:54:09-0800,"The way I see it, Anime would be the most subjective, and almost could be done as a poll. TCG would be the least subjective, because it'd have the least data to figure into the equation to figure out the winner. Video Game would be the middle ground, because you have moveset, equip item, EV/IV that could affect the matchup. It seems pretty well-rounded, because it would give everyone someway to support the Pokemon.I like the idea of a three-tiered system of finding the stronger Pokemon because it means a Pokemon can't just dominate every matchup because it has an overpowered TCG card. On the other hand, the Pokemon could have weak TCG versions of it, but look very strong in the Anime and be quite decent in the Video Game, enough to squeak out a win against the competition."
2013-02-26T11:06:05-0800,"I definitly do not want it to be turned into a poll. And going on just VG stats/move pool and the what not will simply put it into that catagory of just that: stats.I am not so certain on the TCG, I have seen some powerfull cards and some ""why? just........ why?"" type of cards- all of which is give or take as to if a Pokemon has poor/great/awesome cards for the format.I do not know any Manga stuff, but research is research for that if any one wants to use Manga for this. Anime as well.So, an over all combination of those aspects for use to make a ""battle"" happen, to where 1 Pokemon can win regardless of specific things like VG stats- perhaps we could make this a story based game.No matter where a player of the game gets information from, say just going on VG stats/move pool, they could post a ""story"" line type of an attack in favor of the Pokemon they would like to see win the battle.I could figure out a good attack system that is worth a specific amount of hit point draining, and each player could post an attack based on any source such as lore, VG, manga, ect.... to add into the battle's story. Each player would have to wait 5 postings before making another attack.As far as story goes, the battle would be just that- a battle, written out by any of the resources for Pokemon.Take for example the Kingdra vs Dragonite.A player will post something like:""Dragonite was circling above Kindra, waiting for an open chance to hit Kingdra with a well charged Hyper beam, as Kingdra hid below the water. As Kingdra surfaced fast out of the water, Dragonite barrle rolled to the left and let loose the hyper beam, targetting Kingdra in the back, causing Kingdra to make a face plant into the water.""Hyper beam - Dragonite: 200 Kingdra: 190Next poster:(In favor of Dragonite)""Dragonite new he needed to rest for a moment after such an attack. Kingdra had not yet resurfaced to retaliate, so Dragonite landed on a near by rock formation to analyze his next possible move. As he was resting on the rocks, he could see a fast moving shadow speeding towards him below the surface of the water- Dragonite was ready for anything, so he arched his wings way back and prepaired to launch a wing attack. As the water split, Kingdra was leaping out of the water with a hydro pump attack. Dragonite quickly closed his wings in front of him, reflecting the water away from his torso. As Kingdra drew near from the leap, his water attack now complete- Dragonite flapped his wings outward at Kingdra, causing Kingdra to splash hard back into the depths of the water.""Wing attack- Dragonite 200 Kingdra 180Next poster, this time in favor of Kingdra:"" blah blah blah"" Ink blot- TCG Dragonite 190 Kingdra 180I think you guys see what I am saying. As long as there is some elements of any source as far as Pokemon goes-(nothing crazy like ""Kingdra used AK47"") I think it would be cool to have something like this. In a way a game, in a way part story, and in many ways you have legit Pokemon scenarios to draw from to make the battle interesting. As long as people post the source of the attack (like, VG, manga, anime, TCG) - it is cool because everyone is sort of combining different parts of the Pokemon merchandise/franchise.So, how about something like this?"
2013-02-27T07:31:52-0800,"Your example feels a little too much fan-fiction and not enough utilization of actual data. If the matches are allowed to go that route, there is nothing stopping Pokemon from winning when they shouldn't. Certain Pokemon should have clear advantages against others. This is true in the Video Game and sometimes in the TCG, and sometimes completely not true in the Anime.Take your matchup of Dragonite vs. Kingdra. If I were using Kingdra, I would be using Ice attacks, which Dragonite is weak to. If I were using Dragonite, I'd use Dragon attacks, which is Kingdra's only weakness. It would be wise to take into account the VG base stats of the Pokemon, but also include some Anime possibilities like Kingdra diving under water, Dragonite flying up high. I'm not sure how to utilize the TCG here.Perhaps the Anime could work as a randomizer. Every attack on the Pokemon has a x% chance to activate an Anime Cutscene that allows the Pokemon to perform a dodge or perform a super effective attack.It'd be nice if the TCG could factor into it somehow."
2013-02-27T10:12:49-0800,"Factoring in the TCG would be like using an attack from the card that is for one of the Pokemon. Take any set which has one of the Pokemon in it. The TCG has attacks that are not always VG related.Fan fiction/anime/manga= all of which could add some of the flavor text which allows some of the creativity for the battles.VG has stats/advantages (the TCG sort of follows this, but it is catored to fit into the balance of the card game, like weakness and what not)Thus, looking to combine all of these elements into one all out brawl will depend on the choice of the player making the post.A randomizer effect such as the anime element of the battle could work in a bonus factor for making the battles more realistic feel to the battles such as dodging or super effective attack.A good amount of things to take in to see what we can produce with all the resources available for a battle to determin which Pokemon will win, as in the VG there are effects such as critical hits, hold item boosts- ect......."
2013-02-27T11:18:50-0800,"I'm beginning to see resemblance with RP tournaments - which off the top of my head sounds like far too much work, but might be a helpful lead.RP (roleplaying) tournaments as I understand them work as follows. A world is created by some administrators - something small with a few very basic plot elements - and then a basic summary is proposed to prospective players; players 'nominate' existing characters from certain media [sometimes it's restricted, sometimes it's not] and roleplay those characters in the new environment.Players are stuck to a pre-designed combat system so that everyone is considered equal. I don't know much about the system, but it's something where posting (posting well and in-character, at that) gives you ""points"" to use, and using your points well gives you additional points. You use the points to attack other players; you don't actually damage them, you just give yourself more points and at the end you're rated based on how many points you have.With Pokemon the posts would be shorter because character isn't a factor, really, but the trick would be trying to enforce a system that would be easily understood without inhibiting people....Distracted. I have no idea if I made any sense."
2013-03-05T14:13:37-0800,"You made sense, Kayle. I know of what it is your speaking of, just not sure if it needs to be that extreme as far as the amount of work involved in something such as that.Considering we do come up with a system, I do think we would need to perhaps look into a battle system that uses three aspects of battles:In game statsAnimeFictionalStill on the back burner as far as a battle system that could/would work, over all I do not want it to be as simple as a stat/typing battle that gets super technical."
2013-03-05T17:32:05-0800,I dont know if we can use in game stats as it does not do some Pokemon justice. Pidgeot can fly at mach 2 speeds which is over 1500 MPH but its base speed in game is 91 (306 + nature/252 EV) It should be the fastest Pokemon in the game and the strongest based on that fact alone.
2013-03-06T11:50:07-0800,"Been Pidgeot almost always having free retreat in the TCG, it being ridiculously fast in the Anime, and it being just average speed wise in the video game, I think it's an overall fair treatment. That is why I feel it is important to include all three sides of the franchise, because they each compliment each other's strengths and weaknesses."
2013-03-06T16:43:03-0800,"I could generate an attack system that will give specific amounts of damage based on where the source of the attack came from ie: TCG, VG, Anime, Pokedex entry--I could also implament a way for recovery based on these factors as to the source.How does this sound?"
2013-02-18T01:52:05-0800,"Just an idea here, but what do you all think about this:Once a month (maybe twice a month) I select 2 Pokemon to ""face off"" in a battle and you all get to ""build"" one of the Pokemon to defeat the other Pokemon it is facing off against.Example:Mewtwo vs Genesect.I will post both Pokemon according to each of the Pokemon's base stats.You will need to select one of the two and ""build"" the Pokemon to defeat the other by way of move set and where you would like to place the Effort Points.At the end of the time frame that your allowed to post in favor of one of the two Pokemon, the Pokemon with the most post's in favor of winning will be declaired the winner of that round.What do you all think?"
2013-02-18T02:07:37-0800,"I kinda like it. Ultimate Predator or Ultimate Warrior kinda thing, Pokemon style.If we wanted to make it an official sort of thing I would love to bring all the expertise I've got to the table! I mean, this would by definition be a 1v1/singles kind of situation... that's what I do best..."
2013-02-18T02:32:19-0800,"^yeah. I think this would work as a way to get players to understand ""building"" a Pokemon and knowing what it is facing in the battle. Even though one is not ""built"", your building one to purposefully defeat the other by way of having to make up for what it's weaknesses are base stat wise, but to have an advantage move set wise for offense.I don't know exactly yet how I want to set it up- just looking to see if there is even an interest base in this is all.*Side note* Mewtwo will win, hands down, lol! (hay, one of my faves and own personal opinion- lol- plus: I am Team R after all)"
2013-02-18T07:41:44-0800,I like the idea. Its gonna be a Pokemon Showdown!!!!!!!! XD
2013-02-18T07:57:16-0800,Its a cool idea but I dont have mewtwo or gensect :frown::nonono:
2013-02-18T10:34:25-0800,"If we adhere too much to some idea of sticking the two Pokemon in a pure 1v1 battle, it'd be kinda boring - in the Mewtwo vs Genesect thing, Mewtwo autowins cause it has higher base Speed and you can just give it hidden power fire or something. We wouldn't want to actually perform counterbuilds too much, until we know really what we're judging on/what the criteria are and what the contest is. Speed really determines a lot about a matchup between two Pokemon, but when Speed isn't the deciding factor it's usually something else small - like a type advantage over coverage moves, or just enough sheer tankiness and the power to respond in kind."
2013-02-18T11:08:20-0800,Would you factor in things like if a Pokemon can fly and what not?
2013-02-18T13:49:26-0800,^Not sure yet how the mechanics of all of it will be. Thus as an idea and reaching out to every one is to try to figure out a system so we can show the strengths of a Pokemon is all.
2013-02-18T17:38:38-0800,"IMO, this should go more off the ""lore"" behind the two rather than actual mechanics, like say an anime-style fight. Otherwise like Kayle said, Mewtwo is just going to barbeque Genesect with Flamethrower or something."
2013-02-18T21:55:13-0800,"I guarantee I will beat any Mewtwo with Genesect in a real 1v1 battle, against anyone. Someone up for it? No hacks of course."
2013-02-18T22:14:16-0800,I would really like to know how. Mewtwo should win if they are both on even play grounds. Is there something I don't know.
2013-02-18T23:36:21-0800,"Interesting............ see- this is what I am talking about. I also like the idea of ""lore"" being a part of this idea.I do see/know a way for Genesect to defeat Mewtwo.......therefore a good reason to look into how this idea can become an optional activity on here for comparisons against/between Pokemon."
2013-02-18T23:47:53-0800,"PM me your strategy for this because I'm 100% positive there exists at least one Mewtwo set that I can mathematically guarantee will beat literally any Genesect in a pure 1v1, without baton pass or any other additional setup.On one hand, the fact that I can say that kind of defeats the purpose of this idea [in terms of just pure game mechanics] - but on the other, if Pablo's actually on to something, then maybe we've got a lot more to talk about than I thought.While the lore is an interesting place to turn, we don't really have any way to generate statistics for any given Pokemon's power except through the game, which is a lot of the fun of the TV shows of a similar theme - that they actually do all this research and can show you comprehensively how tough these warriors/animals/etc are. I don't think Pokemon is too interested in maintaining a coherent canonical hierarchy."
2013-02-18T23:56:37-0800,"In these type of death matches, we have to put all contenders on common ground. For this it would be the same EV spreads, relate-able items and same items, natures, etc. If He is talking about a Choice Scarf set, we'll also have to put Mewtwo on a scarf as well. If he's talking about super effective reduction items to score a KO on Mewtwo, we'll also have give one to Mewtwo. Mewtwo should win against it in almost all setups because of flamethrower/fire blast. The speed advantage is the biggest weapon Mewtwo has and Genosects 4x weakness to fire does him no justice.We'll have to use all of Mewtwos strengths against all of Genosects strengths and put them on a plain thats not I attack first and then you. Mewtwo is smart so he'll find a way I'm sure."
2013-02-19T01:06:28-0800,"Well I'm talking purely mechanics of the actual video games here, not Pokemon lore. Anyways it's really not that complicated. A mas SP A Bug Buzz is almost always a guaranteed OHKO on any Mewtwo without SpD/HP EV's invested into it (standard Speed/SpA) and so holding a Focus Sash, Genesect would always win due to the priority move it learns (Quick Attack) as Mewtwo learns none.A Bug attack reducing berry would nullify this, as even if the Genesect could be physical based and used Bug Bite instead, to nullify such item, it will not be able to finish off Mewtwo after a Bug Bite + a Quick Attack, so I guess went ahead of myself.

Each player would have to wait 5 postings before making another attack.As far as story goes, the battle would be just that- a battle, written out by any of the resources for Pokemon.Take for example the Kingdra vs Dragonite.A player will post something like:""Dragonite was circling above Kindra, waiting for an open chance to hit Kingdra with a well charged Hyper beam, as Kingdra hid below the water. As Kingdra surfaced fast out of the water, Dragonite barrle rolled to the left and let loose the hyper beam, targetting Kingdra in the back, causing Kingdra to make a face plant into the water.""Hyper beam - Dragonite: 200 Kingdra: 190Next poster:(In favor of Dragonite)""Dragonite new he needed to rest for a moment after such an attack. Kingdra had not yet resurfaced to retaliate, so Dragonite landed on a near by rock formation to analyze his next possible move. As he was resting on the rocks, he could see a fast moving shadow speeding towards him below the surface of the water- Dragonite was ready for anything, so he arched his wings way back and prepaired to launch a wing attack. As the water split, Kingdra was leaping out of the water with a hydro pump attack. Dragonite quickly closed his wings in front of him, reflecting the water away from his torso. As Kingdra drew near from the leap, his water attack now complete- Dragonite flapped his wings outward at Kingdra, causing Kingdra to splash hard back into the depths of the water.""Wing attack- Dragonite 200 Kingdra 180Next poster, this time in favor of Kingdra:"" blah blah blah"" Ink blot- TCG Dragonite 190 Kingdra 180I think you guys see what I am saying. As long as there is some elements of any source as far as Pokemon goes-(nothing crazy like ""Kingdra used AK47"") I think it would be cool to have something like this. In a way a game, in a way part story, and in many ways you have legit Pokemon scenarios to draw from to make the battle interesting. As long as people post the source of the attack (like, VG, manga, anime, TCG) - it is cool because everyone is sort of combining different parts of the Pokemon merchandise/franchise.So, how about something like this?"
2013-02-27T07:31:52-0800,"Your example feels a little too much fan-fiction and not enough utilization of actual data. If the matches are allowed to go that route, there is nothing stopping Pokemon from winning when they shouldn't. Certain Pokemon should have clear advantages against others. This is true in the Video Game and sometimes in the TCG, and sometimes completely not true in the Anime.Take your matchup of Dragonite vs. Kingdra. If I were using Kingdra, I would be using Ice attacks, which Dragonite is weak to. If I were using Dragonite, I'd use Dragon attacks, which is Kingdra's only weakness. It would be wise to take into account the VG base stats of the Pokemon, but also include some Anime possibilities like Kingdra diving under water, Dragonite flying up high. I'm not sure how to utilize the TCG here.Perhaps the Anime could work as a randomizer. Every attack on the Pokemon has a x% chance to activate an Anime Cutscene that allows the Pokemon to perform a dodge or perform a super effective attack.It'd be nice if the TCG could factor into it somehow."
2013-02-27T10:12:49-0800,"Factoring in the TCG would be like using an attack from the card that is for one of the Pokemon. Take any set which has one of the Pokemon in it. The TCG has attacks that are not always VG related.Fan fiction/anime/manga= all of which could add some of the flavor text which allows some of the creativity for the battles.VG has stats/advantages (the TCG sort of follows this, but it is catored to fit into the balance of the card game, like weakness and what not)Thus, looking to combine all of these elements into one all out brawl will depend on the choice of the player making the post.A randomizer effect such as the anime element of the battle could work in a bonus factor for making the battles more realistic feel to the battles such as dodging or super effective attack.A good amount of things to take in to see what we can produce with all the resources available for a battle to determin which Pokemon will win, as in the VG there are effects such as critical hits, hold item boosts- ect......."
2013-02-27T11:18:50-0800,"I'm beginning to see resemblance with RP tournaments - which off the top of my head sounds like far too much work, but might be a helpful lead.RP (roleplaying) tournaments as I understand them work as follows. A world is created by some administrators - something small with a few very basic plot elements - and then a basic summary is proposed to prospective players; players 'nominate' existing characters from certain media [sometimes it's restricted, sometimes it's not] and roleplay those characters in the new environment.Players are stuck to a pre-designed combat system so that everyone is considered equal. I don't know much about the system, but it's something where posting (posting well and in-character, at that) gives you ""points"" to use, and using your points well gives you additional points. You use the points to attack other players; you don't actually damage them, you just give yourself more points and at the end you're rated based on how many points you have.With Pokemon the posts would be shorter because character isn't a factor, really, but the trick would be trying to enforce a system that would be easily understood without inhibiting people....Distracted. I have no idea if I made any sense."
2013-03-05T14:13:37-0800,"You made sense, Kayle. I know of what it is your speaking of, just not sure if it needs to be that extreme as far as the amount of work involved in something such as that.Considering we do come up with a system, I do think we would need to perhaps look into a battle system that uses three aspects of battles:In game statsAnimeFictionalStill on the back burner as far as a battle system that could/would work, over all I do not want it to be as simple as a stat/typing battle that gets super technical."
2013-03-05T17:32:05-0800,I dont know if we can use in game stats as it does not do some Pokemon justice. Pidgeot can fly at mach 2 speeds which is over 1500 MPH but its base speed in game is 91 (306 + nature/252 EV) It should be the fastest Pokemon in the game and the strongest based on that fact alone.
2013-03-06T11:50:07-0800,"Been Pidgeot almost always having free retreat in the TCG, it being ridiculously fast in the Anime, and it being just average speed wise in the video game, I think it's an overall fair treatment. That is why I feel it is important to include all three sides of the franchise, because they each compliment each other's strengths and weaknesses."
2013-03-06T16:43:03-0800,"I could generate an attack system that will give specific amounts of damage based on where the source of the attack came from ie: TCG, VG, Anime, Pokedex entry--I could also implament a way for recovery based on these factors as to the source.How does this sound?"
2013-02-21T07:00:58-0800,"^lol, we can take that chance!"
2013-02-21T14:54:51-0800,"I think if you go the route of the VG, you're going to get a 'right' answer almost always.Who wins, Charizard or Venusaur? Well, Venusaur has low SP DEF, so Charizard can easily attack before it and with a Flamethrower always one-shot the Venusaur. (fictious VG talk)That kind of stuff can get old quickly and in my opinion takes the fun out of it. I think the more fun question is, seeing what the Pokemon can do in the tv show, which Pokemon would win?Charizard could pick up Venusaur, and do his flying spinarooni toss attack (i think it was seismic throw), but Venusaur can use his vines to grip to the rocks on the ground and stop Charizard's attack. Venusaur can use Sleep Power or all kinds of Powders to slow down Charizard, but Charizard could use his wings to blow the powders scattered across the air away. On a sunny day, both Charizard and Venusaur feel strong, with Venusaur being able to shoot constant Solar Beams, but Charizard can dodge them in the air and deliver the final Flame Blast for the KO.See what a little imagination can produce? LOL, maybe it's just me that likes that kind of stuff."
2013-02-21T15:50:35-0800,That is why we need a role playing forum
2013-02-21T17:12:24-0800,"In a way I can see this becoming some sort of a game.Say for example I say that Dragonite and Kingdra will face off.Both Pokemon have say 200 Hit points.A person canthen post an attack by way of an actual attack or a form of ""lore"", thus reducing the other Pokemon's Hit Points by 10.An example of a ""lore"" attack would be for Kingdra to hide under the water in the ocean, and Dragonite attacks with using his Wings to sepporate the water to then Hit Kingdra with Dragon Pulse. Thus, Kingdra loses 10 Hit Points.Players will then need to defend or continue the attacks onto the same Pokemon until One is Knocked Out.There is room for imagination here, and also to use specific attacks that they learn in the games.I am not sure, but this is just a though. What do you guys think?Maybe there is also a way to ""dodge"" an attack as well. There would be a posting restriction like wait 5 post's before you can post again.How does this sound?"
2013-02-21T18:29:57-0800,So what Pokemon? :wink:And what rules?
2013-02-22T02:38:52-0800,"If you look at the Deadliest Warrior show, they take many different variables from both side, test them all out and put them in over 1000 different fights using that data to see who would win the battle. If we can make a system like that then it should work."
2013-02-22T06:09:33-0800,That show is AWESOME:biggrin:
2013-02-22T16:12:10-0800,"huh- interesting. I am not really looking to make it that big- the data alone would be time comsuming. I think that interaction with the members is the best bet, so including in that bit of flavor will be interesting to see how it pans out.More thoughts!"
2013-02-22T16:46:05-0800,"Perhaps have a best of 3 match between the Pokemon in the Anime, the TCG, and the Video Game. Whoever wins 2 or more of the matches wins the whole thing. Anime would be purely subjective, TCG kind of (if there are multiple cards of that Pokemon) but Video Game would be pretty straightforward."
2013-02-22T16:49:53-0800,"Combining all 3 aspects would be cool to make a battle game sort of thing.I am still tossing around ideas in my head, so- not sure of a full result for this idea and the mechanics.I am liking the feed back and ideas coming in though. Keep them coming!"
2013-02-22T22:26:11-0800,Anime seems hardest to do so I'd start discussing that first
2013-02-22T23:58:40-0800,"^ Agreed if Anime is considered. I would need to research the episodes that have Pokemon in them (Or the Movies)-and the Anime magazines.I am not all that familure with Magazine/comic book anime, but it should be rather easy to find episodes to get some ideas for info."
2013-02-23T11:54:09-0800,"The way I see it, Anime would be the most subjective, and almost could be done as a poll. TCG would be the least subjective, because it'd have the least data to figure into the equation to figure out the winner. Video Game would be the middle ground, because you have moveset, equip item, EV/IV that could affect the matchup. It seems pretty well-rounded, because it would give everyone someway to support the Pokemon.I like the idea of a three-tiered system of finding the stronger Pokemon because it means a Pokemon can't just dominate every matchup because it has an overpowered TCG card. On the other hand, the Pokemon could have weak TCG versions of it, but look very strong in the Anime and be quite decent in the Video Game, enough to squeak out a win against the competition."
2013-02-26T11:06:05-0800,"I definitly do not want it to be turned into a poll. And going on just VG stats/move pool and the what not will simply put it into that catagory of just that: stats.I am not so certain on the TCG, I have seen some powerfull cards and some ""why? just........ why?"" type of cards- all of which is give or take as to if a Pokemon has poor/great/awesome cards for the format.I do not know any Manga stuff, but research is research for that if any one wants to use Manga for this.

2013-02-22T14:32:30-0800,"I have the Japanese import games but it doesn't saying its a universal passcode or not. There are interactive cable boxes in Japan ( cox kinda has this feature but no one really ever includes these type of things in shows these days) that if you answer the right question, it will give a password"
2013-02-16T18:45:36-0800,"For those that attended pokemon league during the castelia season(ends Feb 17, 2013), you will be able to receive a Pokemon in similar fashion like the DW scizor and garchomp. This pokemon for playing in the castelia season will be a level 55 Tyranitar with DW ability unnerve, and with moves of payback, crunch, earthquake, and seismic toss. Release date TBA but if following like the others, end of this month or early march"
2013-02-16T23:12:30-0800,"...they really need to stop just releasing fully evolved forms of Pokemon whose DW ability has long already been available in the DW...yeah technically not everyone can log on or do DW, but if you can't do that, odds are likely you can't go online to download these Pokemon anyways...Anyways, as far as Unnerve goes, it's kinda uninspiring considering how instant Sandstorm is the main reason to run Ttar. Now granted, Unnerve can be pretty powerful in VGC as it shuts down damage-reducing berries as well, meaning you can Ice Beam that Garchomp carrying Yache safely into oblivion. So I mean, you can build around it as Ttar is one of the stronger users of it with regards to VGC if you aren't aiming for SS usage. Otherwise your best options are like Haxorus and Houndoom, both of which are more frail sweepers compared to the bulk Ttar has even without SS."
2013-02-17T07:38:02-0800,"Best Unnerve - Aerodactyl. Tyranitar not so much, like Regis Neo said.Now my argument for Regis Neo - for the casual player, like those who are interested in the VGC who go to league, these are perfect. It offers an immediate solution to the hidden abilities to those who are looking for them and with them already fully evolved it means that these casual players have a more powerful solution then what is available in-game to get through the elite four and can take them to a regional and still be alright.I guarantee you that 75% (or greater) of TCG league players haven't beat the video game yet up to the elite four. Getting a level 50+ pokemon that will obey you absolutely free is amazing, and it will push them to beat the game because they don't have to go though the whole level-grinding process. And then they can take these guys and use them in a VGC tournament. Sure, they aren't ""top notch"" like those who work more extensively in the VG, but they are good pokemon that are commonly used in the VG meta. Garchomp, Scizor, Tyranitar are all highly used in the VGC although the abilities may not match the more common used ones.I say this is an amazing idea that TPCI has done to keep VG players going to league as well as getting TCG players interested in the VG."
2013-02-17T07:56:04-0800,Seismic Toss + Unnerve Tyranitar IS unique to this event.
2013-02-17T08:30:07-0800,"Regardless of whether you can get it in the DW or not, Pokemon like Scizor, Garchomp and Tyranitar are so awesome that it makes me want to attend Pokemon League just once to get them."
2013-02-17T08:32:30-0800,"Going to league today; it took them 2 weeks to report me last time. They had no idea what I was talking about, and the girl that runs league was weird to talk to; so I made an information packet so they can just read it."
2013-02-17T09:08:28-0800,Good thing you're goin today. It's the last day of castelia season
2013-02-17T16:05:57-0800,Yeah can't believe I almost missed it like I did Garchomp; now that I have a deck I'm planning on goign to league every week!
2013-02-19T15:30:13-0800,Did anyone's pokemon play page get updated to show that they attended castelia season?
2013-02-19T17:39:02-0800,It's been 3 days since I went; and no update yet. Last time they took 2 weeks; when I go to league next week I'm going to complain that the reporting is taking too long.

2013-02-09T12:16:25-0800,"So, I've been to quite a few VGC tourneys, and many of the top players have been using the RNG method to get their team with close-to-purfect IV's, or shinys. How does that even work? Also, a lot of people (that don't use this method) consider it cheating. What's your opinion?"
2013-02-09T12:57:56-0800,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyQnFr1_60UOf course it's cheating... Everybody has to cheat a little to win in life.Too bad I only collect cards... I wonder how it feels like to go to real tournaments
2013-02-09T13:04:32-0800,Well if it's cheating then shouldn't it not be allowed in tourneys?Except the scans can't find out if you did RNG or not... And isn't there a way you can RNG in the Unova region?
2013-02-09T14:17:30-0800,They can't prove if you caught them or trade them in a legit way... so that's why it's still allowed. With today's technology... everything is possible.
2013-02-09T16:27:21-0800,"It is NOT cheating. Only people who can't do it/ want to be mad at winners call it cheating. It's like calling Tropical Beach cheating because it's expensive. People put effort into the game, and they get their reward out of it."
2013-02-09T17:38:12-0800,Thank you Garch - the RNG is something that Game Freak/Nintendo put in the game on purpose: to randomize how the pokemon but NOTHING is able to actually be completely random. Being able totrackthe RNG is no more cheating than breeding/soft-resetting for a pokemon. Is EV training cheating because it is a mechanic you cannot see outright in the game?You are tracking the games process - not altering it. Tell me how this is cheating
2013-02-09T17:50:48-0800,"I wrote that it is cheating because for me cheating means ""having an unfair advantage over someone else"" a lot of people don't know how to RNG so that's why it's an unfair advantage.. For me, If I do play the game.. RNG looks really simple and easy to manipulate.. I just put my shoes on people who don't know how to RNG so to them, it's really an unfair advantage on them. That's why I said cheating. But in reality, I don't think it's cheating.. like I said.. you have to cheat a little to win in life."
2013-02-09T23:08:29-0800,"Apparently ""Cheating means to me"" and the actual meaning are very different.Here is the definition of the word ""Cheat"":As you can see, it mentions noting of having an unfair advantage. The word cheat is to imply dishonesty, deceit, trick, elude, or to defraud.Using RNG tracking is doing none of these. You are putting the time and effort into learning how a game works and hopefully a reward to the work you put in.If having something that isn't available to the general public is cheating - then Tropical beach would be massively available to everybody and there would be no such thing as event pokemon since having a limited distribution would mean people would be cheating by attending these events.I will also argue that by me taking the time to study the game mechanics, learn how to track the RNG, and put in the time to have a reward to my work is not cheating otherwise everything you ever work for is cheating. Having a college degree to get a job over the other applicants would be cheating - despite me taking the time to study the selected field and they didn't.So next time you try arguing that something is cheating - don't use a personal meaning, try using the actual meaning."

A lot of people don't have the luxury of going to world tournaments.A lot of people don't actually go to the dictionary definition to define a simple word. It's common knowledge the word cheating is having an unfair advantage or upper hand (ask anybody what cheating means without consulting the almighty webster dictionary).Ex 1: Jake ischeatingon his test. (By this example, Jake has an unfair advantage over other students)Ex 2: Jake ischeatingin the poker game because he has some cards under his sleeves. (By this example, Jake has an unfair advantage over the other players)@xxxumbreonxxx: according to ultimatedra, it's not cheating because some people didn't do enough research to figure out what RNG is and how to get the program to track the RNG to get better pokemon to win the game. So any new players who just wants to play pokemon for fun will always lose because of something they don't know ever exist.---------- Post added 02/10/2013 at 01:21 AM ----------please don't compare rng to tropical beaches. pokemon officially released tropical beaches to the public. they did not release a rng tracker.to the public"

R_Inanimate is regarded as one of the world's best players and recently won Oregon Regionals, and he did not RNG a single Pokemon. It's also incredibly easy to get RNG'd Pokemon now, either by doing it yourself or asking the community. The entire competitive VGC community is incredibly generous about donating Pokemon, and there are a few people who have access to pretty much everything you'll need."

I have won Reginals 2 consecutive years, not having a RNG'ed pokemon. plus, even if you don't RNG you can still breed really good pokemon, as i have bred pokemon with 4 perfect iv stats in the stats i wanted, the only real thing RNG adds if your a good breeder is to make the pokemon shiny. And I also agree with Ultimatedra, those who put work into this are going to do well."
2013-02-10T16:16:12-0800,"I just wish Nintendo would take IVs out of the game all together. A ton of competitive players RNGing for the sole reason to affect IVs, an invisible mechanic in the game, just shows that the mechanic is a waste of everyones' time and a failed mechanic.I guess someone can hope that X/Y will not have the IV mechanic."

2013-02-10T23:26:20-0800,I just hope they make some Pokemon stronger from past gens in X and Y. As far as IV's go. I was never a fan of hidden value in a game but Game Freak did it to make Pokemon unique. There is a lot wrong with the Pokemon games (main series) that need to be fixed. I just hope my Pokemon game will be bold enough to take the series in a new direction.

Kinda sad how elam went and embarrassed himself by calling RNGing cheating when a vast majority of the playerbase disagrees with him. There are ways to obtain ""perfect""/competitive Pokemon thatwidely considered cheating, and that involves hacking your game cartridge and directly altering the data. RNGing does not do that.RNG tracking/abuse does toe a weird line, though, because while you aren't actually altering the game data at all, you are still manipulating weaknesses in its systems. It's not much different from using the Missingno glitch from gen 1 to duplicate master balls and then saying you caught every Pokemon legitimately. You did... sort of... but you kind of circumvented the intended system. In both examples there are also still some challenges to face - getting the correct moves on an RNG'd Pokemon, for example, and EV training it.I think the most definite statement someone can make about whether RNGing is ""cheating"" or not is that if you RNG a Pokemon and bring it to a tournament the staff aren't going to care. I think that's as much as you can ask for.If you want to talk about what is or isn't fair that's another story, but I will contend that if you're consistently losing to RNG'd Pokemon you are probably going to consistently lose to non-RNG'd Pokemon played by the same person 'cause he's probably just a better player than you. Oh well.Edit: No one has discussed how it works yet, so far as I can see... I'll try to summarize.Computers are incapable of generating random numbers. Theyjust make up a number off the top of their head, they have no way of doing that. It has to be based on something. But programmers are very clever, and come up with bizarre mathematical functions that produce wildly different numbers depending on what input you give it. These are called PRNGs or pseudo-random number generators. Pokemon uses a PRNG for generating essentially every random factor in the game, from which direction NPCs will walk to what pokemon you encounter in tall grass to what IVs it has to how much damage its moves do.Some people are able to study the code and, through experimentation, figure out what the PRNG is based on - since it has to be based on something. If you know what the PRNG takes in as input, and you know what itwith that input, then you can predict what input and actions are required to get the result you want - which in this case would mean hatching an egg with perfect or near-perfect IVs. The actual method, if I remember right, involves changing the time on your DS, and mashing your way through the opening sequence as fast as humanly possible... but that's Gen 4. I don't remember what all changed in Gen 5. I think some of it got easier."
2013-02-11T10:17:34-0800,"Well he said make some older Pokemon stronger, not all...for example, maybe giving new evolutions to some of the older ones, making some of the more useless Pokemon like Farfetch'd at least passably usable. No one cared about Golbat for example until it could evolve into Crobat, same with Togetic getting Togekiss.I'm gonna stay out of the above debate, though like Prime said no IVs would be kinda nice, it would also (sort of anyways) eliminate general cheating and using other means to acquire perfect Pokemon if they all basically came the same with 31 IVs. But that would also kill off (in a vague sense) on getting ""unique"" and ""different"" Pokemon, which while having nothing but added bothersome to the competitive side, gives Pokemon more of a unique flavor I suppose for people who don't care about all of the above."
2013-02-11T15:53:43-0800,"Here is how I view RNG abuse. The game used RNG to generate Pokemon to make them all 'unique' so no one Pokemon is the same. IV's EV's and other related factors were suppose to be hidden values, as in you as the player were never suppose to see them/know them.Abusing the RNG can be viewed as cheating, even if it were program into the game. You are gaming a system not meant to be used by players. Why can it be cheating? Well, you need to use external software to track random events. This is done by hacking the game to see how the Random Number Generator's code was programmed. RNG is a byproduct of hacking the game you use the RNG method on so in a way youcheating.I feel the same way about programs like PokSAV and Pokegen that let you directly see your Pokemon's data. Both can be viewed as cheating because you're not playing the game the way it was intended and it was intended for you not to know your Pokemon's IV's and EV's as well as your trainers SID. As for myself, I use RNG and PokSAV/Pokegen as tools to improve my game. I've also talk to other VGC players who do use save editors/RNG. I think as far as most players are concern, as long as the Pokemon can exist in the game, then its legit.Keep in mind that numbers dont always matter. You still need to be able to use your team. You can have the best stats and still lose. Again, everyone has mixed feelings on this."
2013-02-11T15:56:50-0800,"Perhaps taking away the IV system, this would allow for the Natures to dominate the outcome for the stats that can be maxed out after applying the EV points in to boost the stats your wanting to max out.If a Pokemon has it's Base stats already, why should that stat suffer and not be able to just hit the max without having to be EV'd?Say you have an Adamant T-Tar. You EV train it to be max attack, and invest in the Defense stat as well. There should be no reason for the other stats to not even hit the bare maximum stat without having to invest the EV's at all.Maybe there should be a way to reverse-EV a Pokemon's stats.It could work something like this:Take the Adamant T-Tar, and you have EV's you can invest (510) how you would like. Any stat you do not invest in should just simply go to the max, and will only go past the max if you invest into that stat.Then you could ""reverse"" EV as stat to be lower then what the Base stat max's out at.You could have 120 Base stat lowering EV's to make a Pokemon be slower, but you are required to use all 120 ""reverse"" EV's in order to balance out the ""fairness"" of having all the non EV raised stats.Maybe even a mech that if for every +3 in say Attack stat, the Special attack stat will go down -1.Either way, it is an idea. The whole reason behind the IV's is so that no two Pokemon are the same, which is unique to each one ""supposably"" being different from the others. This allows for each one to be ""built"" to make best use of how you want it built: Special attacker + physical defense, Physical attacker + Special Defense, ect....So, if a Pokemon just reaches Base stat with no EV's, then boosted by EV investment- you will max out that stat and the other stats will be ""max"" to what the Base stat is without EV investment.I do think something does need to change, although Breeding can give 4 31 IV's, but you sort of do not have 100% control unless you do RNG to say get a Zero in for example speed.I think you should be able to reduce the speed stat by way of some form of ""reverse"" EV'ing.Just some thoughts is all."
2013-02-12T03:54:35-0800,"I think IVs/EVs/Natures work great in a recreation game, but I don't think the Pokemon games were ever meant to be used for a competitive prize-based program.I'm hoping, with X/Y, that Nintendo has noticed the competitive side of the game and has adjusted the game to address the needs of the competitive player. The competitive player can't afford to spend time to hatch a million eggs and raise them to level 100 to see which Pokemon has the best stats. Nature/EVs can be calculated and planned.We see more multiplayer options open up with each new generation, I don't see why changes like the removal of IVs is impossible, to further support competitive battling.Pokemon will still feel unique without IVs because there will be natures, EVs, equip items, attack choices, and there are over 500 pokemon to choose from."
2013-02-09T12:16:25-0800,"So, I've been to quite a few VGC tourneys, and many of the top players have been using the RNG method to get their team with close-to-purfect IV's, or shinys.

2013-02-09T14:17:30-0800,They can't prove if you caught them or trade them in a legit way... so that's why it's still allowed. With today's technology... everything is possible.

2013-02-09T17:38:12-0800,Thank you Garch - the RNG is something that Game Freak/Nintendo put in the game on purpose: to randomize how the pokemon but NOTHING is able to actually be completely random. Being able totrackthe RNG is no more cheating than breeding/soft-resetting for a pokemon. Is EV training cheating because it is a mechanic you cannot see outright in the game?You are tracking the games process - not altering it. Tell me how this is cheating

2013-02-09T17:50:48-0800,"I wrote that it is cheating because for me cheating means ""having an unfair advantage over someone else"" a lot of people don't know how to RNG so that's why it's an unfair advantage.. For me, If I do play the game.. RNG looks really simple and easy to manipulate.. I just put my shoes on people who don't know how to RNG so to them, it's really an unfair advantage on them. That's why I said cheating. But in reality, I don't think it's cheating.. like I said.. you have to cheat a little to win in life."
2013-02-09T23:08:29-0800,"Apparently ""Cheating means to me"" and the actual meaning are very different.Here is the definition of the word ""Cheat"":As you can see, it mentions noting of having an unfair advantage. The word cheat is to imply dishonesty, deceit, trick, elude, or to defraud.Using RNG tracking is doing none of these. You are putting the time and effort into learning how a game works and hopefully a reward to the work you put in.If having something that isn't available to the general public is cheating - then Tropical beach would be massively available to everybody and there would be no such thing as event pokemon since having a limited distribution would mean people would be cheating by attending these events.I will also argue that by me taking the time to study the game mechanics, learn how to track the RNG, and put in the time to have a reward to my work is not cheating otherwise everything you ever work for is cheating. Having a college degree to get a job over the other applicants would be cheating - despite me taking the time to study the selected field and they didn't.So next time you try arguing that something is cheating - don't use a personal meaning, try using the actual meaning."
2013-02-10T00:02:00-0800,"You asked me how it is cheating to me... I answered.. and you post this:Well as you can see... The person that post this thread asked us to share our opinion. So that's what I did. You did not have to attack me for using a personal meaning. If you say, it's not cheating... then I accept that. Don't have to be so defensive about it and attack me for saying it is. There is no right answer to this thread because it is opinion based."
2013-02-10T01:00:04-0800,"Well, let's start over..1. xxxumbreonxxx asked ""a lot of people considered RNG as cheating,what is your opinion?""2. I answered that question.3. You stated your answer and asked me why I thought it was4. I explained why I thought it was cheatingThen you say this:So basically, you're telling me not to state my opinion because I used a personal meaning to answer your question. This post should not have a right or wrong answer because it is opinionated. So I retract all my replies on this post.And FYI, there are some people who don't know what tropical beaches are because it's a promo not released in stores. A lot of people don't have the luxury of going to world tournaments.A lot of people don't actually go to the dictionary definition to define a simple word. It's common knowledge the word cheating is having an unfair advantage or upper hand (ask anybody what cheating means without consulting the almighty webster dictionary).Ex 1: Jake ischeatingon his test. (By this example, Jake has an unfair advantage over other students)Ex 2: Jake ischeatingin the poker game because he has some cards under his sleeves. (By this example, Jake has an unfair advantage over the other players)@xxxumbreonxxx: according to ultimatedra, it's not cheating because some people didn't do enough research to figure out what RNG is and how to get the program to track the RNG to get better pokemon to win the game. So any new players who just wants to play pokemon for fun will always lose because of something they don't know ever exist.---------- Post added 02/10/2013 at 01:21 AM ----------please don't compare rng to tropical beaches. pokemon officially released tropical beaches to the public. they did not release a rng tracker.to the public"
2013-02-10T07:06:54-0800,"First of all, you don't need RNG'd Pokemon to do well. R_Inanimate is regarded as one of the world's best players and recently won Oregon Regionals, and he did not RNG a single Pokemon. It's also incredibly easy to get RNG'd Pokemon now, either by doing it yourself or asking the community. The entire competitive VGC community is incredibly generous about donating Pokemon, and there are a few people who have access to pretty much everything you'll need."
2013-02-10T08:24:49-0800,"I agree with Prodigiosus, you don't need to RRNG to do well. I have won Reginals 2 consecutive years, not having a RNG'ed pokemon. plus, even if you don't RNG you can still breed really good pokemon, as i have bred pokemon with 4 perfect iv stats in the stats i wanted, the only real thing RNG adds if your a good breeder is to make the pokemon shiny. And I also agree with Ultimatedra, those who put work into this are going to do well."
2013-02-10T16:16:12-0800,"I just wish Nintendo would take IVs out of the game all together. A ton of competitive players RNGing for the sole reason to affect IVs, an invisible mechanic in the game, just shows that the mechanic is a waste of everyones' time and a failed mechanic.I guess someone can hope that X/Y will not have the IV mechanic."
2013-02-10T16:28:38-0800,"I will say that I do agree that you do NOT need an RNG'd Pokemon to win. Skill on the other hand, is another topic- you can NOT RNG skill."
2013-02-10T23:26:20-0800,I just hope they make some Pokemon stronger from past gens in X and Y. As far as IV's go. I was never a fan of hidden value in a game but Game Freak did it to make Pokemon unique. There is a lot wrong with the Pokemon games (main series) that need to be fixed. I just hope my Pokemon game will be bold enough to take the series in a new direction.
2013-02-11T09:32:44-0800,">Hope they make Pokemon strongerThe power creep is alreadyI skimmed. Kinda sad how elam went and embarrassed himself by calling RNGing cheating when a vast majority of the playerbase disagrees with him. There are ways to obtain ""perfect""/competitive Pokemon thatwidely considered cheating, and that involves hacking your game cartridge and directly altering the data. RNGing does not do that.RNG tracking/abuse does toe a weird line, though, because while you aren't actually altering the game data at all, you are still manipulating weaknesses in its systems. It's not much different from using the Missingno glitch from gen 1 to duplicate master balls and then saying you caught every Pokemon legitimately. You did... sort of... but you kind of circumvented the intended system. In both examples there are also still some challenges to face - getting the correct moves on an RNG'd Pokemon, for example, and EV training it.I think the most definite statement someone can make about whether RNGing is ""cheating"" or not is that if you RNG a Pokemon and bring it to a tournament the staff aren't going to care. I think that's as much as you can ask for.If you want to talk about what is or isn't fair that's another story, but I will contend that if you're consistently losing to RNG'd Pokemon you are probably going to consistently lose to non-RNG'd Pokemon played by the same person 'cause he's probably just a better player than you. Oh well.Edit: No one has discussed how it works yet, so far as I can see... I'll try to summarize.Computers are incapable of generating random numbers. Theyjust make up a number off the top of their head, they have no way of doing that. It has to be based on something. But programmers are very clever, and come up with bizarre mathematical functions that produce wildly different numbers depending on what input you give it. These are called PRNGs or pseudo-random number generators. Pokemon uses a PRNG for generating essentially every random factor in the game, from which direction NPCs will walk to what pokemon you encounter in tall grass to what IVs it has to how much damage its moves do.Some people are able to study the code and, through experimentation, figure out what the PRNG is based on - since it has to be based on something. If you know what the PRNG takes in as input, and you know what itwith that input, then you can predict what input and actions are required to get the result you want - which in this case would mean hatching an egg with perfect or near-perfect IVs. The actual method, if I remember right, involves changing the time on your DS, and mashing your way through the opening sequence as fast as humanly possible... but that's Gen 4. I don't remember what all changed in Gen 5. I think some of it got easier."
2013-02-11T10:17:34-0800,"Well he said make some older Pokemon stronger, not all...for example, maybe giving new evolutions to some of the older ones, making some of the more useless Pokemon like Farfetch'd at least passably usable. No one cared about Golbat for example until it could evolve into Crobat, same with Togetic getting Togekiss.I'm gonna stay out of the above debate, though like Prime said no IVs would be kinda nice, it would also (sort of anyways) eliminate general cheating and using other means to acquire perfect Pokemon if they all basically came the same with 31 IVs. But that would also kill off (in a vague sense) on getting ""unique"" and ""different"" Pokemon, which while having nothing but added bothersome to the competitive side, gives Pokemon more of a unique flavor I suppose for people who don't care about all of the above."
2013-02-11T15:53:43-0800,"Here is how I view RNG abuse. The game used RNG to generate Pokemon to make them all 'unique' so no one Pokemon is the same. IV's EV's and other related factors were suppose to be hidden values, as in you as the player were never suppose to see them/know them.Abusing the RNG can be viewed as cheating, even if it were program into the game. You are gaming a system not meant to be used by players. Why can it be cheating? Well, you need to use external software to track random events. This is done by hacking the game to see how the Random Number Generator's code was programmed. RNG is a byproduct of hacking the game you use the RNG method on so in a way youcheating.I feel the same way about programs like PokSAV and Pokegen that let you directly see your Pokemon's data. Both can be viewed as cheating because you're not playing the game the way it was intended and it was intended for you not to know your Pokemon's IV's and EV's as well as your trainers SID. As for myself, I use RNG and PokSAV/Pokegen as tools to improve my game. I've also talk to other VGC players who do use save editors/RNG. I think as far as most players are concern, as long as the Pokemon can exist in the game, then its legit.Keep in mind that numbers dont always matter. You still need to be able to use your team. You can have the best stats and still lose. Again, everyone has mixed feelings on this."
2013-02-11T15:56:50-0800,"Perhaps taking away the IV system, this would allow for the Natures to dominate the outcome for the stats that can be maxed out after applying the EV points in to boost the stats your wanting to max out.If a Pokemon has it's Base stats already, why should that stat suffer and not be able to just hit the max without having to be EV'd?Say you have an Adamant T-Tar. You EV train it to be max attack, and invest in the Defense stat as well. There should be no reason for the other stats to not even hit the bare maximum stat without having to invest the EV's at all.Maybe there should be a way to reverse-EV a Pokemon's stats.It could work something like this:Take the Adamant T-Tar, and you have EV's you can invest (510) how you would like. Any stat you do not invest in should just simply go to the max, and will only go past the max if you invest into that stat.Then you could ""reverse"" EV as stat to be lower then what the Base stat max's out at.You could have 120 Base stat lowering EV's to make a Pokemon be slower, but you are required to use all 120 ""reverse"" EV's in order to balance out the ""fairness"" of having all the non EV raised stats.Maybe even a mech that if for every +3 in say Attack stat, the Special attack stat will go down -1.Either way, it is an idea. The whole reason behind the IV's is so that no two Pokemon are the same, which is unique to each one ""supposably"" being different from the others. This allows for each one to be ""built"" to make best use of how you want it built: Special attacker + physical defense, Physical attacker + Special Defense, ect....So, if a Pokemon just reaches Base stat with no EV's, then boosted by EV investment- you will max out that stat and the other stats will be ""max"" to what the Base stat is without EV investment.I do think something does need to change, although Breeding can give 4 31 IV's, but you sort of do not have 100% control unless you do RNG to say get a Zero in for example speed.I think you should be able to reduce the speed stat by way of some form of ""reverse"" EV'ing.Just some thoughts is all."
2013-02-12T03:54:35-0800,"I think IVs/EVs/Natures work great in a recreation game, but I don't think the Pokemon games were ever meant to be used for a competitive prize-based program.I'm hoping, with X/Y, that Nintendo has noticed the competitive side of the game and has adjusted the game to address the needs of the competitive player. The competitive player can't afford to spend time to hatch a million eggs and raise them to level 100 to see which Pokemon has the best stats. Nature/EVs can be calculated and planned.We see more multiplayer options open up with each new generation, I don't see why changes like the removal of IVs is impossible, to further support competitive battling.Pokemon will still feel unique without IVs because there will be natures, EVs, equip items, attack choices, and there are over 500 pokemon to choose from."

What do we need to do to qualify for the Scizor download? Assuming the leagues nearby don't run video game events, will I need to put a TCG deck together?"
2012-11-13T17:14:24-0800,"I'm curious about this too. I attend league, but for my player rewards I chose the TCG side over the video game side. I'm hoping I can get this Scizor too."
2012-11-13T17:37:51-0800,"I have an i.d, and don't really play the tcg. Hoping I can get a Scizor, when is the Aspertia Season starting?"
2012-11-13T17:42:00-0800,Started. Past-tense. And almost finished. GET OUT THERE IF YOU WANT THIS THING!
2012-11-13T17:52:05-0800,Do I need to actually play in the league?

2012-11-13T18:18:52-0800,Sounds like just attending and being recorded as attending will do the trick
2012-11-13T18:19:55-0800,I think you just need to be recorded as attending
2012-11-13T18:22:17-0800,"Wow really? Just found out one of my closest leagues is on Friday. I'll be going, and I'll let you guys know how it works."

2012-11-13T20:46:50-0800,It's likely tied to your Player ID. You need to have BW or BW2 linked to your PGL account to get this.

Yes, they use older cards, and yes, sometimes the kids are annoying, but for the most part, it's fun and keeps the juniors and seniors interested and involved.I realize that many masters don't play in league, but if we all want Pokemon to stay strong and continue for a long time, then we all should ""help"" with building and expanding the base.Okay, stepping off the soap box. Thanks."

2012-11-14T13:43:51-0800,"Even though the Dream World ability is not favored over Scizor's other one, Pursiut and Steel wing are moves that take a bit of effort to be equipped onto Scizor. That about is the only ""specialness"" this Scizor has."

2012-11-15T17:27:06-0800,"You do need to attend league in order to earn this distribution. As long as you are reported as having attended Aspertia season and you have synched your game with the Pokémon Global Link, your account will be flagged to receive the promotional Scizor.Because this promotion is being offered via the PGL, any Pokémon we give out this way will have the Dream World ability rather than the normal ability. This distribution method will also affect the level of the Pokémon you receive. For example, Scizor will be level 10, but the Pokémon that players can earn for being reported in the Virbank league season will be level 48. :thumb:"

2012-11-15T19:55:04-0800,"I am fine with both of these! Rough skin Garchomp is amazing for teams that don't run sandstorm and even though Haxorus is a bit lackluster compared to other dragons, Unnerve is an amazing ability that turns off those nasty berries like Haban berry and Sitrus berry.I very much approve of either for next season!"
2012-11-16T15:15:21-0800,My league leaders say they know nothing about this. Will I still be able to get the Scizor?
2012-11-16T16:30:03-0800,"Absolutely. You have access to the Scizor by simply being part of League and having a Pokemon Global Account (or whatever it's called). Once the League is reported, you can go to your Global Account, and they'll give you instructions on how to get it. According to Biggie, it's a roughly similar process to how you got the Togekiss."

2012-11-17T14:49:44-0800,"Yes, you should then be able to receive it next month when the season ends.No - you My pokemon account is automatically tied to your Global link account."
2012-11-17T15:42:22-0800,"Sorry. They gave an iD and pin, not id and code"
2012-11-17T19:33:14-0800,"I have an I.D and Pin. When I go to my league, should I tell the organizer to put me down on attendance? I don't think they do that at mine, since it's flexible hours. What should I ask the organizer?"
2012-11-17T19:50:32-0800,"They will need your POP ID # and your date of birth to register you for the league location. Once your league leaders have reported your attendance, you should see something like this:"
2012-11-18T15:11:45-0800,"When does the Aspertia season end exactly? Wasn't able to go to league today, since our family friend came to visit before she goes on her final deployment to Afghanistan."
2012-11-18T15:55:22-0800,"November 25, but I think a lot of leagues wont be held next week due to thanksgiving"
2012-11-18T16:27:06-0800,"My League is on the 25th of next week, will I still be able to get Scizor?"
2012-11-27T10:41:06-0800,"Went to the League on the 25th. Still working on my TCG skills, had a good time. It's been 2 days and my account was not listed as being participated in the Aspertia League. I just called the TO and she says the Pokemon Organizer usually doesn't report in, and no one knew about the Scizor distribution. She said she will tell the organizer to report in, and fix the issue. I'll be playing allot of Pokemon this season, not just for the in game characters."
2012-12-20T11:50:00-0800,"So I'm listed as attending the league during the Aspertia Season. Synched my game, and no Scizor in promotions. Anyone else having this problem?"
2012-12-20T12:11:35-0800,"Same here. It says go to promotions page, but there's nada there about Scizor."
2012-12-20T16:31:23-0800,"You are not alone. The accounts who have been reported as part of their league are in the process of being flagged as we speak but it is just taking a bit longer than expected.

2012-11-13T16:39:12-0800,"http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/op_2012_league_pokemon_distribution-2012-11-13/I'm a Pokemon Video Game player with only a bit of TCG experience so I'm wondering how this promotion worked. What do we need to do to qualify for the Scizor download? Assuming the leagues nearby don't run video game events, will I need to put a TCG deck together?"
2012-11-13T17:14:24-0800,"I'm curious about this too. I attend league, but for my player rewards I chose the TCG side over the video game side. I'm hoping I can get this Scizor too."
2012-11-13T17:37:51-0800,"I have an i.d, and don't really play the tcg. Hoping I can get a Scizor, when is the Aspertia Season starting?"
2012-11-13T17:42:00-0800,Started. Past-tense. And almost finished. GET OUT THERE IF YOU WANT THIS THING!
2012-11-13T17:52:05-0800,Do I need to actually play in the league?
2012-11-13T18:17:09-0800,"Pokemon League Scizor - how to earn it?How do you earn the Scizor in the Pokemon League? Is it the standard do enough games and fill up the card thing?Light Armor seems like a lame ability, does it have any uses?"
2012-11-13T18:18:52-0800,Sounds like just attending and being recorded as attending will do the trick
2012-11-13T18:19:55-0800,I think you just need to be recorded as attending
2012-11-13T18:22:17-0800,"Wow really? Just found out one of my closest leagues is on Friday. I'll be going, and I'll let you guys know how it works."
2012-11-13T19:17:36-0800,"You won't get it at the league though, they said the promotion begins December 20th I believe."
2012-11-13T19:20:47-0800,"Light Metal is a pretty lame ability considering its other option is TECHNICIAN. :Olike omg technician is so good.Light Metal affects only a select few attacks like Heavy Slam, Grass Knot, Low Kick, etc.; seeing as Scizor isn't weak to any of these moves and only Grass Knot really sees much competitive play (Low Kick sees a LITTLE use on Weavile! <3) I don't think Light Metal has any real merit to it, even if we were to ignore the fact that Scizor gets one of the best abilities in the game and you'd have to be ignoring it to use Light Metal..."
2012-11-13T20:46:50-0800,It's likely tied to your Player ID. You need to have BW or BW2 linked to your PGL account to get this.
2012-11-14T08:35:39-0800,"Can I suggest that yes, you actually play in the league?We've been going to a local league for the past month, and I can tell you it's a great way to get the younger players involved. Yes, they use older cards, and yes, sometimes the kids are annoying, but for the most part, it's fun and keeps the juniors and seniors interested and involved.I realize that many masters don't play in league, but if we all want Pokemon to stay strong and continue for a long time, then we all should ""help"" with building and expanding the base.Okay, stepping off the soap box. Thanks."
2012-11-14T12:55:39-0800,"I do intent to play. I was just wondering if you need to earn the Scizor, or if you have to show up? I won't be able to go the the league often, as the closest one to me in about a 35 minute drive. Will we need a account registered under Video Gaming?"
2012-11-14T13:43:51-0800,"Even though the Dream World ability is not favored over Scizor's other one, Pursiut and Steel wing are moves that take a bit of effort to be equipped onto Scizor. That about is the only ""specialness"" this Scizor has."
2012-11-15T09:55:21-0800,"So, you have to go through a lot of egg breeding transferring moves to end up with Pursuit and Steel Wing on a scizor?"
2012-11-15T17:27:06-0800,"You do need to attend league in order to earn this distribution. As long as you are reported as having attended Aspertia season and you have synched your game with the Pokémon Global Link, your account will be flagged to receive the promotional Scizor.Because this promotion is being offered via the PGL, any Pokémon we give out this way will have the Dream World ability rather than the normal ability. This distribution method will also affect the level of the Pokémon you receive. For example, Scizor will be level 10, but the Pokémon that players can earn for being reported in the Virbank league season will be level 48. :thumb:"
2012-11-15T17:40:22-0800,"Woah, a Garchomp or a Haxorus ^_^"
2012-11-15T19:55:04-0800,"I am fine with both of these! Rough skin Garchomp is amazing for teams that don't run sandstorm and even though Haxorus is a bit lackluster compared to other dragons, Unnerve is an amazing ability that turns off those nasty berries like Haban berry and Sitrus berry.I very much approve of either for next season!"
2012-11-16T15:15:21-0800,My league leaders say they know nothing about this. Will I still be able to get the Scizor?
2012-11-16T16:30:03-0800,"Absolutely. You have access to the Scizor by simply being part of League and having a Pokemon Global Account (or whatever it's called). Once the League is reported, you can go to your Global Account, and they'll give you instructions on how to get it. According to Biggie, it's a roughly similar process to how you got the Togekiss."
2012-11-16T21:10:42-0800,"@Prime-Scizor gets Steel Wing through breeding (egg move), and for the Pursuit attack you would need to use a Heart Scale is all."
2012-11-17T13:42:36-0800,I got an ID and code. Synced it yesterday. Does it mean I'll get a scizor if it says this?http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y1...3-B3FA-808E03A915A6-2552-0000011AB94FCD03.jpg

2012-11-17T19:50:32-0800,"They will need your POP ID # and your date of birth to register you for the league location. Once your league leaders have reported your attendance, you should see something like this:"
2012-11-18T15:11:45-0800,"When does the Aspertia season end exactly? Wasn't able to go to league today, since our family friend came to visit before she goes on her final deployment to Afghanistan."

2012-11-18T16:27:06-0800,"My League is on the 25th of next week, will I still be able to get Scizor?"
2012-11-27T10:41:06-0800,"Went to the League on the 25th. Still working on my TCG skills, had a good time. It's been 2 days and my account was not listed as being participated in the Aspertia League. I just called the TO and she says the Pokemon Organizer usually doesn't report in, and no one knew about the Scizor distribution. She said she will tell the organizer to report in, and fix the issue.

2012-12-24T15:43:35-0800,"^Problem with that is the rules change over time. Event Pokemon can be released at any level, like the Mew we got in HGSS that was level 5. Sometimes non-event Pokemon's availability change, too. For instance, in Gen 3-4 it's impossible to get a Lv. 1 Milotic. In Gen 5, it's possible. So they'd have to rework the rules any time they made a change, which probably sounds like too much of a headache to them.What I wish there was is a filter for the requested level.

2012-12-23T15:45:28-0800,For gameshark users to move pokemon while only owning one DS.
2012-12-23T21:45:14-0800,"Eh regardless after BW debuted, you'd think the game makers would have wised up to the obvious fact certain Pokemon/level combos can't legally exist and just program it to not make those possible..."
2012-12-24T15:43:35-0800,"^Problem with that is the rules change over time. Event Pokemon can be released at any level, like the Mew we got in HGSS that was level 5. Sometimes non-event Pokemon's availability change, too. For instance, in Gen 3-4 it's impossible to get a Lv. 1 Milotic. In Gen 5, it's possible. So they'd have to rework the rules any time they made a change, which probably sounds like too much of a headache to them.What I wish there was is a filter for the requested level. Like, ""I only want to see Reshirams where they ask for Pokemon between 40 and 50"", or ""What Mews are available that want Lv. 100's in return?"". That seems like a sensible thing to me."
2012-12-27T08:10:05-0800,Another problem is when I run into a Level 1 Ratata for a Lv.100 Dialga in return.
2012-12-28T16:47:39-0800,"""Want: Reshiram Lv. 9 and under."" everywhere."
2012-12-29T06:48:41-0800,"They should have a seperate trading section for legendarie, or ban legendaries all together."
2012-12-29T16:52:22-0800,"The game should have flag checks for this though. If it detects impossible offers or request, the game should reject it."
2012-12-30T20:37:27-0800,"I wish it would reject it, but it doesn't. I have also seen dubious uses of the GTS, that if you were taking advantage of, you wouldn't want your uploaded pokemon to be traded away while you do the required dubiousness, which I suspect actually accounts for a surprising portion of these level 9 Dialga requests.I think it would be funny to Gameshark a bunch of level 9 legendaries and trade them"
2013-01-08T10:40:29-0800,"The server should refuse the requests. The games would still be allowed to make them, and once a pokémon can be legitimately obtained at that level, they update the server so it accepts requests for it. The server already refuses tosuch pokémon (I tested it once, using a GTS-hacked level 5 Reshiram), there's no reason it can't refuse a request for one."
2013-01-02T11:08:26-0800,"I'm trying to go after a few Pokemon and nothing is coming up, not even items."
2013-01-02T11:47:11-0800,"I read somewhere that after the fifth time of going into the dream world in one single day, that pokemon and items will stop appearing.But I've had it happen after my second time, so I don't know the rules exactly."
2013-01-02T13:11:32-0800,"I do not know the exact amount of Pokemon/items you can find while on the dream world, but since your only allowed to go there once every 24 hours for an hour, I think that it is limited so that it is an detourant so that your not actually going to use the full hour."
2013-01-02T13:53:30-0800,Its kind of annoying though. I'm trying to go after the Zangoose and a hand full of the birds. Whats even worse about it is it picks the maps at random. its a huge detourant for me all together.
2013-01-02T14:49:08-0800,"I know what you mean, I'm trying to get a Quilfish for my Poison only run of the game but even getting the right area doesn't mean you get the Pokemon you want. Apparently the area you get can be influenced by the Type of the Pokemon you tuck in, it's on Bulbapedia / Bulbagarden if you didn't know. Certain Pokemon only appear after a certain number of dream points too."
2013-01-02T16:16:16-0800,"Honestly, I think the Dream World is sort of dying out for it's usefullness in so many ways.Sure, you can tuck in a Pokemon to influence an area to appear- but then you still need to rely on chance for certain Pokemon to even show up, and then you hit the ""no items/Pokemon"" showing up at all, you need to wait 24 hours as it is.I don't know, people have time for it, I no longer do. And I am not saying the DR is all that bad- I think the need for it for myself is really low is all."
2013-01-02T16:49:11-0800,"The area/pokemon you go to is based on 2 things:1) The game you are playing (B1/W1 or B2/W2)2) The type of pokemon tucked inSo normal types will lean toward Dream Park, Ice will lean toward icy cave, and Psychic types go toward spooky manor."
2013-01-02T17:22:58-0800,"I dunno if it's actually right or not, but from my experience, it's the dumb minigames that affect how many times you can go around. For example, back when I played every one of the miserable things to get to 10k points, I was able to go through the varying areas plenty of times. Now that I just jot in with a specific Pokemon tucked in to try getting the area/Pokemon I want and ignore every minigame, it's lessened considerably. Which is why I now try to do the ""easy to ignore"" ones like the berry scoop and just drop in a scoop to technically ""beat"" it, and hopefully extend how many times I can keep going into areas.But yeah, would love it if someone actually knew why/how it works."

It doesn't matter if you don't play the games or pick up items either.

Turtwig - Shell Armor, Chimchar - Iron Fist, Piplup - Defiant.This seems very similar to an old promotion where the newest versions of Black/White held a code for a Lucario w/ a Hidden Ability (correct me if I am wrong)."
2012-12-07T11:50:44-0800,Does it have to be bought from wal-mart because I got my game at game stop

2012-11-28T12:30:06-0800,"So, the new DW zone opened up and I was welcomed by a whole bunch of Gulpins with Gluttony and Audinos with Klutz. While, there always seems to be some case in which an ability is useful, even if it doesn't happen a lot, some of these abilities are just plain not useful. And, some Pokemon you find in the Dream World have no Dream World ability, which is confusing.So, I thought it'd be useful if people worked together to create a list of Pokemon worth going after in the Dream World because of their Dream World ability.Only catch is that they have to be available NOW in the North America game.Anyone have any other suggestions?IN DREAM WORLDDREAM PARKCombee-> Vespiquen - Hustle/Unerve - Hidden Grotto/Dream Park: Bad Pokemon, but both of them enjoy their DW ability. Vespiquen's regular ability isnt unusable though, some sets will prefer Pressure, but shutting off Lum Berry helps it Toxic Stall, which is all it does.Zangoose- Toxic Boost - Hidden Grotto/Dream Park: A signature dream world ability is pretty cool, and this works better on Zangoose than Immunity in every way, so why not?Shroomish-> Breeloom - Quick Feet/Technician -Dream Park/Hidden Grotto: Quick Feet is cute and alright but TechLoom is a monster. Mach Punch/Low Sweep/Bullet Seed/Spore or Stone Edge. that's all you'll ever need.Heracross-Moxie - Hidden Grotto/Dream Park: If you have a Heracross and it's not a MoxieCross, it should probably be a MoxieCross.Scraggy-> Scrafty - Intimidate - I've heard good things about Intimidate Scraggy. Useful for switching into fights and Scraggy is a pretty strong fighter to begin with, so it helps him fight off worthy physical attackers.Ekans-> Arbok - Unnerve - Being able to stop berries like Lum, Sitrus, and type-resist is amazing. Intimidate is a great ability too, but Unnerve has its uses.Grimer-> Muk - Poison Touch - Dream Park/Hidden Grotto: ...It is better than it's other abilities. Never really played with it. Maybe I shouldPinsir- Moxie - Dream Park/Hidden Grotto: Best ability for it. Gives +1 attack for each KO it gets.PLEASANT FORESTTympole-> Palpitoad -> Siesmetoad - Water Absorb - Pleasent Forest: Immunity abilities on common types are good, and quite standard on Water/Ground types. It works better than most of his abilities in most cases.Pachirisu- Volt Absorb - Pleasent Forest/Hidden Grotto: Its other abilities both do literally nothing, so anythign is an improvement.Shinx-> Luxio -> Luxray - Guts - Pleasent Forest: Awful Pokemon, but it reallyonly has two sets you could ever hope to use, and Guts is one fo them.GirafarigorStantlerorMiltank- Sap Sipper - Pleasent Forest: None of these Pokemon mind Sap Sipper, all can use it decently, but its not the clear cut ability on any of them either.Poochyena-> Mightyenna - Rattled/Moxie - Pleasent Forest: Poochyenna doesn't really care what ability he has, but Mightyenna can start to function as a halfway decent Pokemon with Sucker Punch/Crunch and Moxie in its arsenal.Tauros- Sheer Force - Pleasent Forest: Sheer Force is really just too good. Every Pokemon appreciates it.Natu-> Xatu - Magic Bounce - Pleasent Forest: Magic Bounce is the only reason to use Xatu. The number fo moves it makes completely useless is staggering.Doduo-> Dodrio - Tangled Feet - Pleasent Forest: None of its other abilities are great, and Tangled Feet lets you use a Choice Banded Thrash (now 120 BP) without ever becoming confused, which makes use of its decent attack and good speed.Nidoran F-> Nidorina -> Nidoqueen orNidoran M-> Nidorino -> Nidoking - Sheer Force - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: The best ability they get and a movepool to match. Pair it up with Life Orb (get the boost in power, but the ability negates the self-damage) and you won't need to worry about the stats it has. Being able to use Ice Beam, Earth Power, Sludge Bomb, Thunderbolt, etc means you will hit almost everything for super-effective AND have the ability AND life orb to boot.Vulpix-> Ninetales - Drought - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: Takes Groudon's ability and brings it into legal use in competitions. Being able to increase it's own fire attacks, enable 1-turn solarbeams, and turn on Chlorophyll is an amazing ability.Poliwag-> Poliwhirl -> Poliwrath - Swift Swim - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: Poliwrath is a pretty decent physical attacker, a rare sight in rain teams. Now with double the speed he can make good use of it.Poliwag-> Poliwhirl -> Politoed - Drizzle - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: Kyogres ability in tournament legal form. This guy has seen TONS of use, enabling water pokemon to get more attack power AND enable Swift Swim. You are bound to see this guy pretty often.Rattata-> Raticate - Hustle - Pleasant Forest: Adds a ton of power to an underwhelming pokemon. Guts has the same boost, but I like having HP for a focus sash.Psyduck-> Golduck - Swift Swim - Pleasant Forest: Double speed in the rain? Great! Not much a move pool, but it is better than Damp for sure.Exeggcute-> Exeggutor - Harvest - Pleasant Forest: Harvest has a 50% chance of bringing back a used berry every turn, or 100% guaranteed while the sun is out. Sitrus? Type resist berry? Get them back with Harvest.Lickitung-> Lickilicky - Cloud Nine - Pleasant Forest: Being able to put a stop the the Rain, Sun, and Sand teams people use quite commonly is a great niche in the game. And being the best pokemon to use Explosion is always nice.Tangela-> Tangrowth Regenerator - Pleasant Forest: See Slowpoke, but with Giga drain and other healing moves also.Kangaskhan- Inner Focus - Pleasant Forest: See Meowth/Persian.SPARKLING SEAAlomomola- Regenerator - Sparkling Sea: Not as good a Regenerator as Amoongus, but not a bad addition.Buizel-> Floatzel - Water Veil - Sparkling Sea: They can run either ability, but Switcherro/Flame Orb/Water Veil is a very cool niche this Pokemon has.Barboach-> Wishcash - Hydration - Sparkling Sea; I have used this thign in competitve battling where no one took it seriously and swept teams 6-0 with this guy. Rest/DD/Earthwuake/Waterfall in the rain can do so much damage it isnt even funny. And there is just something gratifying about using a Wishcash when you beat someoneCorpish-> Crawdaunt - Adaptability - Sparkling Sea: Crawdaunt is the only Adaptability Poke with two typings, making it dangerous already. Add in Dragon Dance and you can have an amazingly proficeiant sweeper. If only it got Aqua Jet :/Lileep-> Cradily - Storm Drain - Sparkling Sea: Lots of sea critters with great DW abilities. Storm Drain turns a neuatral hit into a healing immunity, which allows Cradily to set up Stockpiles easier.Anorith-> Armaldo - Swift Swim - Sparkling Sea: Seriously, so much Sparklign sea in a row o.o Swift Swim is decent on these pokes, but they just aren't good Pokemon inof themselves.Carvanha-> Sharpedo - Speed Boost - Sparkling Sea: Gotta go fastQwilfish- Intimidate - Skarling Sea: Makes better use of his decent typing to wall fighting types and fire types in long enough to set up some hazards.Wooper-> Quagsire - Unburden - Sparkling Sea: make Quagsire an excellent wall with Curse and Recover.Krabby-> Kingler - Sheer Force - Sparkling Sea/Hidden Grotto: His other abilities dont really help, and Sheer Force is an amazing ability. Its not as suited to him as some Pokemon, but its better than nothing.Dratini-> Dragonair -> Dragonite - Multiscale - Sparkling Sea/Hidden Grotto: When at full HP the damage you take is halved. This with Roost makes him quite the tank.Goldeen-> Seaking - Lightningrod - Sparkling Sea: See PikachuMagikarp-> Gyarados - Moxie - Sparkling Sea: See PinsirLapras- Hydration - Sparkling Sea: Heals status conditions in the rain. So you have free use of Rest EVERY turn. Being as defensive as it is, this is an amazing ability for her.Tentacool-> Tentacruel - Rain Dish - Sparkling Sea: Tentacruel is quite the defensive pokemon, and in the rain he will heal off what damage he will be taking. MUCH better than Liquid ooze ever will be.Slowpoke-> Slowbro -> Slowking - Regenerator - Sparkling Sea/Dream Radar: Slowbro/king are VERY defensive. Being able to set up a trick room throw a few attacks out, and switch to get some auto healing is amazing. Hands down his best ability.ICY CAVEKlang-> Klinklang - Clear Body - Icy Cave: Plus and Minus are horrible, even in doubles, since KK likes physical attacks better. The only ability it can use, and its not bad for the Pokemon.Gible-> Gabite -> Garchomp- Rough Skin - Icy Cave: Not sure why Gible would hang out near Ice, but Rough Skin is a decent ability, especially when playign where Sand Veil is banned.Snorunt-> Froslass - Cursed Body - Icy Cave: I'm not touching on any Pokemon with Moody because its a broken ability banned in every metagame i'll ever play, so ignore Snowrunt. But Cursed Body cna allow this Pokemon to set up Spikes and Destiny Bonds easier.Swinub-> Piloswine -> Mamoswine - Thick Fat - Icy Cave: An extra resistance and cancelation of a weakness with Mamo's handful of usable moves still available is too good to pass up.Diglett-> Dugtrio - Sand Force - Icy Cave: Dugtrio is already really fast, so why not just increase its power in a sandstorm? Earthquake and Rock Slide become deadly on this guy.Voltorb-> Electrode - Aftermath - Icy Cave: This is a toss up between Static and this. Both are very sub par but that is what they get.Sandshrew-> Sandslash - Sand Rush - Icy Cave: Sand rush makes Sandslash mildly usable as an offesnive Pokemon, something its previously never been able to do better than somethign else. Still outclassed by Excadrill, but better than it has been.SPOOKY MANORGolett-> Golurk - No Guard - Spooky Manor: Usable, though i tend to lean towards Iron Fist.Elegym-> Beheeym - Analytic - Spooky Manor: Slow Pokemon anyway, Synchornise is alright, but usualy Analytic will be superior.Sableye- Prankster - Spooky Manor/Nimbasa (BW2) : Sableye has a rediculous number of options to go alongside Prankster, that can easily shut down physically offesnive or set up Pokemon.VolbeatorIllumise- Prankster - Spooky Manor: Really this is Volbeat's blessing with Tail Glow/Baton pass, but Illumise doesnt have much else going for it.Ralts-> Kirlia -> Gallade - Justified -Spooky Manor/Nimbasa City (BLW2): You have to get a Ralts to get it, but Ralts' ability is worse than its usual ones. Justified however gives Gallade a way to raise his attack, which is usually better than Steadfast.Smoochum-> Jynx - Hydration/Dry Skin - Spooky Manor: Giving Jynx an immunity to Water can easily give you a free turn to use Lovely Kiss, Substitute, Nasty Plot or just go ont he offensive, and the constant healing under Rain is also quite nice.Meowth-> Persian - Unnerve - Spooky Manor/Minbasa City trade: See Arbok, but able to use Fake Out as well.Abra-> Kadabra -> Alakazam - Magic Guard - Spooky Manor: Magic Guard protects from all passive damage, be it Hail, Sand, Burn, Poison or...wait for it...Life orb! Alakazam already has an amazing special attack but back it up with Life orb without the self-damage, you will be getting KO's left and right.Drowzee-> Hypno - Inner Focus - Spooky Manor: Being able to throw a Hypnosis without fear of taking a Fake out is great. The best ability for this pokemon.RUGGED MOUNTAINMaractus- Storm Drain - Rugged Mountain: Better than Water Asborb, even though it does about the same thing.Burmy-> Mothim - Tinted Lens - Pokemon Cafe Forest/Rugged Mountain: Bad Pokemon, its prevos don't want their DW abilities, but this one is slightly better than Swarm.Bagon-> Shelgon -> Salamence - Sheer Force/Overcoat/Moxie - Rugged Mountain/Hidden Grotto: Moxiemence is the big claim to fame here, but the others don't hate their abilities either. But seriously. Moxiemence. Moxie is one of those abiltiies that blesses every Pokemon it touches. And Salamence is the peak of the Moxie Mountain.Spinda- Contrary - Rugged Mountain/Nimbasa (BW2): Super Power Contrary Spinda is fun, and more usable than anything else it could ever do.Cacnea-> Cacturne - Water Absorb - Rugged Mountain: If you aren't using Sand, or are playign in a metagame where Sand Veil is banned, this is the best ability for it.Tyrogue-> Hitmonlee - Vital Spirit/Unburden - Rugged Mountain: Not the best for Tyrogue, but Unburden, alongside Normal Gem and Fake Out make Hitmonlee a dangerously fast and powerful sweeper.Mankey-> Primeape - Defiant - Rugged Mountain: It's best ability. Get intimidated? Get that attack back +1 extra. Icy wind? More attack. Get the picture?Magnemite-> Magneton -> Magnezone - Analytic - Rugged Mountain: Since these guys are so slow, you are almost guaranteed to get the Analytic boost. Backed by its high special attack and defense you are sure to make use of it.WINDSWEPT SKYDucklett-> Swanna - Hydration - Windswept Sky: Better than the other two abilities, and Swanna really wants Rain support for its dual STABs.Emolga- Motor Drive - Windswept Sky: Emolga is frail, so anything that lets it not take a hit is good.Pidove-> Tranquil -> Unfezant - Rivalry - Windswept Sky: None of its abilities are good, but this is a usable option.Drifloon-> Drifblim - Flare Boost - Windwept Sky: Getting the other half of Zangoose's ability, these Pokemon have 3 abilities that are all useful, and all for vary different roles.Starly ->Staravia-> Staraptor - Reckless - Windswept Sky: Added damage to its two best STAB moves make it an even more dangerous Pokemon.Tropius- Harvest - Windswept Sky: Worse than the Eggs at using it, but better than non-Harvest Tropius.Swablu-> Altaria - Cloud Nine - Windswept Sky/Hidden Grotto: An equally good ability as Natural Cure. Shutting down weather is better in doubles, Nautral Cure is better in singles, but both are worth noting.Wingull-> Pelipper - Rain Dish - Windswept Sky: Keen Eye is bad, Rain Dish is ok. Keen Eye is really, really bad.Murkrow-> Honchkrow - Prankster/Moxie - Windswept Sky/Hidden Grotto: Both abilities that perfectly compliment what the Pokemon can do, better than any other ability they have access to.Gligar-> Gliscor - Immunity/Poison Heal - Windswept Sky/Hidden Grotto: Again, both Pokemon get abilities that allow them to function best at what they are meant to do.Aerodactyl- Unnerve - Windswept Sky: See Ekans/Arbok.Spearow-> Fearow - Sniper - Windswept Sky: Fearow is actually a cool Poke with the introduction of Drill Run. And Keen Eye is one of the worst abilities ever, so Sniper is a major improvement.IN-GAMEHIDDEN GROTTOCubchoo-> Beartic - Rattled/Swift Swim - Hidden Grotto: Snow Cloak is just bad (and sometimes banned) so these abilities make more sense, though neither are that good on the Pokemon.Foongus-> Amoongus - Regenerator - Hidden Grotto: Big big winner. Regenerator Amoongus replaces all other Amoongus. Not even outclasses, replaces. You use it with Regenerator, or you don't use it. Period.Trubbish-> Garbodor - Aftermath - Hidden Grotto: More useful in most cases as he sets up hazards.Mincinno-> Cinccino - Skill Link - Hidden Grotto: Yes on all accounts. This is the only way to use this Pokemon, and it packs such a punch. Three different moves that will hit 5 times guaranteed providing decent coverage on non Steel types, with Wake Up Slap or U-turn as good 4th moves for that.Blitzle-> Zebstrika - Sap Sipper - Hidden Grotto: All their abilities are immunity abilities, so you can tailor it to whatever you want. Nice that it can't be Spored i suppose.Woobat-> Swoobat - Simple - Hidden Grotto: Awww yeah. Simple Calm Mind for days. Great ability.Lillipup-> Herdier -> Stoutland - Scrappy - Hidden Grotto: Sand Rush is usually better, but if you arent using Sand, being able to nail Ghosts with STAB Return frees you up from needing Crunch, and makes Choiced Sets better.Purrloin-> Liepard - Prankster - Hidden Grotto: Swagger/Sub/Foul Play is a fun set. No Pokemon really dislikes Prankster as an ability, but this is not one of the better users of it.Pachirisu- Volt Absorb - Pleasent Forest/Hidden Grotto: Its other abilities both do literally nothing, so anythign is an improvement.Combee-> Vespiquen - Hustle/Unerve - Hidden Grotto/Dream Park: Bad Pokemon, but both of them enjoy their DW ability. Vespiquen's regular ability isnt unusable though, some sets will prefer Pressure, but shutting off Lum Berry helps it Toxic Stall, which is all it does.Bagon-> Shelgon -> Salamence - Sheer Force/Overcoat/Moxie - Rugged Mountain/Hidden Grotto: Moxiemence is the big claim to fame here, but the others don't hate their abilities either. But seriously. Moxiemence. Moxie is one of those abiltiies that blesses every Pokemon it touches. And Salamence is the peak of the Moxie Mountain.Zangoose- Toxic Boost - Hidden Grotto/Dream Park: A signature dream world ability is pretty cool, and this works better on Zangoose than Immunity in every way, so why not?Swablu-> Altaria - Cloud Nine - Windswept Sky/Hidden Grotto: An equally good ability as Natural Cure. Shutting down weather is better in doubles, Nautral Cure is better in singles, but both are worth noting.Shroomish-> Breeloom - Quick Feet/Technician -Dream Park/Hidden Grotto: Quick Feet is cute and alright but TechLoom is a monster. Mach Punch/Low Sweep/Bullet Seed/Spore or Stone Edge. that's all you'll ever need.Heracross-Moxie - Hidden Grotto/Dream Park: If you have a Heracross and it's not a MoxieCross, it should probably be a MoxieCross.Murkrow-> Honchkrow - Prankster/Moxie - Windswept Sky/Hidden Grotto: Both abilities that perfectly compliment what the Pokemon can do, better than any other ability they have access to.Gligar-> Gliscor - Immunity/Poison Heal - Windswept Sky/Hidden Grotto: Again, both Pokemon get abilities that allow them to function best at what they are meant to do.Krabby-> Kingler - Sheer Force - Sparkling Sea/Hidden Grotto: His other abilities dont really help, and Sheer Force is an amazing ability. Its not as suited to him as some Pokemon, but its better than nothing.Grimer-> Muk - Poison Touch - Dream Park/Hidden Grotto: ...It is better than it's other abilities. Never really played with it. Maybe I shouldPinsir- Moxie - Dream Park/Hidden Grotto: Best ability for it. Gives +1 attack for each KO it gets.Ditto- Imposter - Hidden Grotto: Instant use of Transform without needing the attack. Need I say more?Dratini-> Dragonair -> Dragonite - Multiscale - Sparkling Sea/Hidden Grotto: When at full HP the damage you take is halved. This with Roost makes him quite the tank.Poliwag-> Poliwhirl -> Poliwrath - Swift Swim - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: Poliwrath is a pretty decent physical attacker, a rare sight in rain teams. Now with double the speed he can make good use of it.Poliwag-> Poliwhirl -> Politoed - Drizzle - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: Kyogres ability in tournament legal form. This guy has seen TONS of use, enabling water pokemon to get more attack power AND enable Swift Swim. You are bound to see this guy pretty often.Nidoran F-> Nidorina -> Nidoqueen orNidoran M-> Nidorino -> Nidoking - Sheer Force - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: The best ability they get and a movepool to match. Pair it up with Life Orb (get the boost in power, but the ability negates the self-damage) and you won't need to worry about the stats it has. Being able to use Ice Beam, Earth Power, Sludge Bomb, Thunderbolt, etc means you will hit almost everything for super-effective AND have the ability AND life orb to boot.Vulpix-> Ninetales - Drought - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: Takes Groudon's ability and brings it into legal use in competitions. Being able to increase it's own fire attacks, enable 1-turn solarbeams, and turn on Chlorophyll is an amazing ability.OTHERBurmy-> Mothim - Tinted Lens - Pokemon Cafe Forest/Rugged Mountain: Bad Pokemon, its prevos don't want their DW abilities, but this one is slightly better than Swarm.Spinda- Contrary - Rugged Mountain/Nimbasa (BW2): Super Power Contrary Spinda is fun, and more usable than anything else it could ever do.Sableye- Prankster - Spooky Manor/Nimbasa (BW2) : Sableye has a rediculous number of options to go alongside Prankster, that can easily shut down physically offesnive or set up Pokemon.Ralts-> Kirlia -> Gallade - Justified -Spooky Manor/Nimbasa City (BLW2): You have to get a Ralts to get it, but Ralts' ability is worse than its usual ones. Justified however gives Gallade a way to raise his attack, which is usually better than Steadfast.Pichu-> Pikachu -> Raichu - Lightningrod - World Champs '12/breeding: AMAZING ABILITY. Being able to boost your special attack from an accurate switch in or discharge from your other pokemon is amazing. Add on the light ball and Pikachu is now reaching devastating levels of special attack.Eevee-evolutions- multiple uses for multiple pokemon. I may update this later.Slowpoke-> Slowbro -> Slowking - Regenerator - Sparkling Sea/Dream Radar: Slowbro/king are VERY defensive. Being able to set up a trick room throw a few attacks out, and switch to get some auto healing is amazing. Hands down his best ability."
2012-11-28T18:00:27-0800,"Useful as I have said before is in the eye of the beholder but some are more obvious than others. Here is my list (starting at the top of the pokedex, by availability to the USA/PAL regions. This is going to be a long list.Rattata/Raticate - Hustle - Pleasant Forest: Adds a ton of power to an underwhelming pokemon. Guts has the same boost, but I like having HP for a focus sash.Ekans/Arbok - Unnerve - Dream Park: Being able to stop berries like Lum, Sitrus, and type-resist is amazing. Intimidate is a great ability too, but Unnerve has its uses.Pichu/Pikachu/Raichu - Lightningrod - World Champs '12/breeding: AMAZING ABILITY. Being able to boost your special attack from an accurate switch in or discharge from your other pokemon is amazing. Add on the light ball and Pikachu is now reaching devastating levels of special attack.Nidoqueen/Nidoking - Sheer Force - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: The best ability they get and a movepool to match. Pair it up with Life Orb (get the boost in power, but the ability negates the self-damage) and you won't need to worry about the stats it has. Being able to use Ice Beam, Earth Power, Sludge Bomb, Thunderbolt, etc means you will hit almost everything for super-effective AND have the ability AND life orb to boot.Vulpix/Ninetales - Drought - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: Takes Groudon's ability and brings it into legal use in competitions. Being able to increase it's own fire attacks, enable 1-turn solarbeams, and turn on Chlorophyll is an amazing ability.Diglett/Dugtrio - Sand Force - Icy Cave: Dugtrio is already really fast, so why not just increase its power in a sandstorm? Earthquake and Rock Slide become deadly on this guy.Meowth/Persian - Unnerve - Spooky Manor/Minbasa City trade: See Arbok, but able to use Fake Out as well.Psyduck/Golduck - Swift Swim - Pleasant Forest: Double speed in the rain? Great! Not much a move pool, but it is better than Damp for sure.Mankey/Primeape - Defiant - Rugged Mountain: It's best ability. Get intimidated? Get that attack back +1 extra. Icy wind? More attack. Get the picture?Poliwag/Poliwhirl/Poliwrath - Swift Swim - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: Poliwrath is a pretty decent physical attacker, a rare sight in rain teams. Now with double the speed he can make good use of it.Politoed - Drizzle - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: Kyogres ability in tournament legal form. This guy has seen TONS of use, enabling water pokemon to get more attack power AND enable Swift Swim. You are bound to see this guy pretty often.Abra/Kadabra/Alakazam - Magic Guard - Spooky Manor: Magic Guard protects from all passive damage, be it Hail, Sand, Burn, Poison or...wait for it...Life orb! Alakazam already has an amazing special attack but back it up with Life orb without the self-damage, you will be getting KO's left and right.Tentacool/Tentacruel - Rain Dish - Sparkling Sea: Tentacruel is quite the defensive pokemon, and in the rain he will heal off what damage he will be taking. MUCH better than Liquid ooze ever will be.Slowpoke/Slowbro/Slowking - Regenerator - Sparkling Sea/Dream Radar: Slowbro/king are VERY defensive. Being able to set up a trick room throw a few attacks out, and switch to get some auto healing is amazing. Hands down his best ability.Magnemite/Magneton/Magnezone - Analytic - Rugged Mountain: Since these guys are so slow, you are almost guaranteed to get the Analytic boost. Backed by its high special attack and defense you are sure to make use of it.Grimer/Muk - Poison Touch - Dream Park/Hidden Grotto: ...It is better than it's other abilities. Never really played with it. Maybe I shouldDrowzee/Hypno - Inner Focus - Spooky Manor: Being able to throw a Hypnosis without fear of taking a Fake out is great. The best ability for this pokemon.Voltorb/Electrode - Aftermath - Icy Cave: This is a toss up between Static and this. Both are very sub par but that is what they get.Exeggcute/Exeggutor - Harvest - Pleasant Forest: Harvest has a 50% chance of bringing back a used berry every turn, or 100% guaranteed while the sun is out. Sitrus? Type resist berry? Get them back with Harvest.Lickitung/Lickilicky - Cloud Nine - Pleasant Forest: Being able to put a stop the the Rain, Sun, and Sand teams people use quite commonly is a great niche in the game. And being the best pokemon to use Explosion is always nice.Tangella/Tangrowth Regenerator - Pleasant Forest: See Slowpoke, but with Giga drain and other healing moves also.Kangaskhan - Inner Focus - Pleasant Forest: See Meowth/Persian.Goldeen/Seaking - Lightningrod - Sparkling Sea: See PikachuPinsir - Moxie - Dream Park/Hidden Grotto: Best ability for it. Gives +1 attack for each KO it gets.Gyarados - Moxie - Sparkling Sea: See PinsirLapras - Hydration - Sparkling Sea: Heals status conditions in the rain. So you have free use of Rest EVERY turn. Being as defensive as it is, this is an amazing ability for her.Ditto - Imposter - Hidden Grotto: Instant use of Transform without needing the attack. Need I say more?Eevee-evolutions - multiple uses for multiple pokemon. I may update this later.Aerodactyl - Unnerve - Windswept Sky: See Ekans/Arbok.Dragonite - Multiscale - Sparkling Sea/Hidden Grotto: When at full HP the damage you take is halved. This with Roost makes him quite the tank.That is it for now. I may do the rest later."
2012-11-29T08:50:41-0800,"Holy wall of text Batman!Does Harvest bring back a berry used more than one turn ago, or is it a one-time 50% or 100% chance to return the berry, and then more chance if the berry is brought back?Lightning Rod on Seaking is funny!Imposter on Ditto is amazing!"
2012-11-29T11:23:35-0800,"Spearow/Fearow - Sniper - Windswept Sky: Fearow is actually a cool Poke with the introduction of Drill Run. And Keen Eye is one of the worst abilities ever, so Sniper is a major improvement.Sandshrew/Sandslash - Sand Rush - Icy Cave: Sand rush makes Sandslash mildly usable as an offesnive Pokemon, something its previously never been able to do better than somethign else. Still outclassed by Excadrill, but better than it has been.Doduo/Dodrio - Tangled Feet - Pleasent Forest: None of its other abilities are great, and Tangled Feet lets you use a Choice Banded Thrash (now 120 BP) without ever becoming confused, which makes use of its decent attack and good speed.Krabby/Kingler - Sheer Force - Sparkling Sea/Hidden Grotto: His other abilities dont really help, and Sheer Force is an amazing ability. Its not as suited to him as some Pokemon, but its better than nothing.Tyrogue/Hitmonlee - Vital Spirit/Unburden - Rugged Mountain: Not the best for Tyrogue, but Unburden, alongside Normal Gem and Fake Out make Hitmonlee a dangerously fast and powerful sweeper.Smoochum/Jynx - Hydration/Dry Skin - Spooky Manor: Giving Jynx an immunity to Water can easily give you a free turn to use Lovely Kiss, Substitute, Nasty Plot or just go ont he offensive, and the constant healing under Rain is also quite nice.Taurous - Sheer Force - Pleasent Forest: Sheer Force is really just too good. Every Pokemon appreciates it.Natu/Xatu - Magic Bounce - Pleasent Forest: Magic Bounce is the only reason to use Xatu. The number fo moves it makes completely useless is staggering.Wooper/Quagsire - Unburden - Sparkling Sea: make Quagsire an excellent wall with Curse and Recover.Murkrow/Honchkrow - Prankster/Moxie - Windswept Sky/Hidden Grotto: Both abilities that perfectly compliment what the Pokemon can do, better than any other ability they have access to.Gligar/Gliscor - Immunity/Poison Heal - Windswept Sky/Hidden Grotto: Again, both Pokemon get abilities that allow them to function best at what they are meant to do.Qwilfish - Intimidate - Skarling Sea: Makes better use of his decent typing to wall fighting types and fire types in long enough to set up some hazards.HERACROSS -Moxie - Hidden Grotto/Dream Park: If you have a Heracross and it's not a MoxieCross, it should probably be a MoxieCross.Swinub/Piloswine/Mamoswine - Thick Fat - Icy Cave: An extra resistance and cancelation of a weakness with Mamo's handful of usable moves still available is too good to pass up.Girafarig/Stantler/Miltank - Sap Sipper - Pleasent Forest: None of these Pokemon mind Sap Sipper, all can use it decently, but its not the clear cut ability on any of them either.Poochyena/Mightyenna - Rattled/Moxie - Pleasent Forest: Poochyenna doesn't really care what ability he has, but Mightyenna can start to function as a halfway decent Pokemon with Sucker Punch/Crunch and Moxie in its arsenal.Wingull/Pelipper - Rain Dish - Windswept Sky: Keen Eye is bad, Rain Dish is ok. Keen Eye is really, really bad.Gallade - Justified -Spooky Manor/Nimbasa City (BLW2): You have to get a Ralts to get it, but Ralts' ability is worse than its usual ones. Justified however gives Gallade a way to raise his attack, which is usually better than Steadfast.Shroomish/BREELOOM - Quick Feet/Technician -Dream Park/Hidden Grotto: Quick Feet is cute and alright but TechLoom is a monster. Mach Punch/Low Sweep/Bullet Seed/Spore or Stone Edge. that's all you'll ever need.Sableye - Prankster - Spooky Manor/Nimbasa (BW2) : Sableye has a rediculous number of options to go alongside Prankster, that can easily shut down physically offesnive or set up Pokemon.Volbeat/Illumise - Prankster - Spooky Manor: Really this is Volbeat's blessing with Tail Glow/Baton pass, but Illumise doesnt have much else going for it.Carvanha/Sharpedo - Speed Boost - Sparkling Sea: Gotta go fastSpinda - Contrary - Rugged Mountain/Nimbasa (BW2): Super Power Contrary Spinda is fun, and more usable than anything else it could ever do.Cacnea/Cacturne - Water Absorb - Rugged Mountain: If you aren't using Sand, or are playign in a metagame where Sand Veil is banned, this is the best ability for it.Swablu/Altaria - Cloud Nine - Windswept Sky/Hidden Grotto: An equally good ability as Natural Cure. Shutting down weather is better in doubles, Nautral Cure is better in singles, but both are worth noting.Zangoose - Toxic Boost - Hidden Grotto/Dream Park: A signature dream world ability is pretty cool, and this works better on Zangoose than Immunity in every way, so why not?Barboach/Wishcash - Hydration - Sparkling Sea; I have used this thign in competitve battling where no one took it seriously and swept teams 6-0 with this guy. Rest/DD/Earthwuake/Waterfall in the rain can do so much damage it isnt even funny. And there is just something gratifying about using a Wishcash when you beat someoneCorpish/Crawdaunt - Adaptability - Sparkling Sea: Crawdaunt is the only Adaptability Poke with two typings, making it dangerous already. Add in Dragon Dance and you can have an amazingly proficeiant sweeper. If only it got Aqua Jet :/Lileep/Cradily - Storm Drain - Sparkling Sea: Lots of sea critters with great DW abilities. Storm Drain turns a neuatral hit into a healing immunity, which allows Cradily to set up Stockpiles easier.Anorith/Armaldo - Swift Swim - Sparkling Sea: Seriously, so much Sparklign sea in a row o.o Swift Swim is decent on these pokes, but they just aren't good Pokemon inof themselves.Tropius - Harvest - Windswept Sky: Worse than the Eggs at using it, but better than non-Harvest Tropius.Froslass - Cursed Body - Icy Cave: I'm not touching on any Pokemon with Moody because its a broken ability banned in every metagame i'll ever play, so ignore Snowrunt. But Cursed Body cna allow this Pokemon to set up Spikes and Destiny Bonds easier.Bagon/Shelgon/SALAMENCE - Sheer Force/Overcoat/Moxie - Rugged Mountain/Hidden Grotto: Moxiemence is the big claim to fame here, but the others don't hate their abilities either. But seriously. Moxiemence. Moxie is one of those abiltiies that blesses every Pokemon it touches. And Salamence is the peak of the Moxie Mountain.Staravia/Staraptor - Reckless - Windswept Sky: Added damage to its two best STAB moves make it an even more dangerous Pokemon.Shinx/Luxio/Luxray - Guts - Pleasent Forest: Awful Pokemon, but it reallyonly has two sets you could ever hope to use, and Guts is one fo them.Mothim - Tinted Lens - Pokemon Cafe Forest/Rugged Mountain: Bad Pokemon, its prevos don't want their DW abilities, but this one is slightly better than Swarm.Combee/Vespiquen - Hustle/Unerve - Hidden Grotto/Dream Park: Bad Pokemon, but both of them enjoy their DW ability. Vespiquen's regular ability isnt unusable though, some sets will prefer Pressure, but shutting off Lum Berry helps it Toxic Stall, which is all it does.Pachirisu - Volt Absorb - Pleasent Forest/Hidden Grotto: Its other abilities both do literally nothing, so anythign is an improvement.Buizel/Floatzel - Water Veil - Sparkling Sea: They can run either ability, but Switcherro/Flame Orb/Water Veil is a very cool niche this Pokemon has.Drifloon/Drifblim - Flare Boost - Windwept Sky: Getting the other half of Zangoose's ability, these Pokemon have 3 abilities that are all useful, and all for vary different roles.Gible/Gabite/Garchomp- Rough Skin - Icy Cave: Not sure why Gible would hang out near Ice, but Rough Skin is a decent ability, especially when playign where Sand Veil is banned.Herdier/Stoutland - Scrappy - Hidden Grotto: Sand Rush is usually better, but if you arent using Sand, being able to nail Ghosts with STAB Return frees you up from needing Crunch, and makes Choiced Sets better.Purrloin/Liepard - Prankster - Hidden Grotto: Swagger/Sub/Foul Play is a fun set. No Pokemon really dislikes Prankster as an ability, but this is not one of the better users of it.Pidove/Tranquil/Unfezant - Rivalry - Windswept Sky: None of its abilities are good, but this is a usable option.Blitzle/Zebstrika - Sap Sipper - Hidden Grotto: All their abilities are immunity abilities, so you can tailor it to whatever you want. Nice that it can't be Spored i suppose.Woobat/Swoobat - Simple - Hidden Grotto: Awww yeah. Simple Calm Mind for days. Great ability.Tympole/Palpitoad/Siesmetoad - Water Absorb - Pleasent Forest: Immunity abilities on common types are good, and quite standard on Water/Ground types. It works better than most of his abilities in most cases.Maractus - Storm Drain - Rugged Mountain: Better than Water Asborb, even though it does about the same thing.Trubbish/Garbodor - Aftermath - Hidden Grotto: More useful in most cases as he sets up hazards.Mincinno/CINCCINO - Skill Link - Hidden Grotto: Yes on all accounts. This is the only way to use this Pokemon, and it packs such a punch. Three different moves that will hit 5 times guaranteed providing decent coverage on non Steel types, with Wake Up Slap or U-turn as good 4th moves for that.Ducklett/Swanna - Hydration - Windswept Sky: Better thant he other two abilities, and Swanna really wants Rain support for its dual STABs.Emolga - Motor Drive - Windswept Sky: Emolga is frail, so anything that lets it not take a hit is good.Foongus/AMOONGUS - Regenerator - Hidden Grotto: Big big winner. Regenerator Amoongus replaces all other Amoongus. Not even outclasses, replaces. You use it with Regenerator, or you don't use it. Period.Alomomola - Regenerator - Sparkling Sea: Not as good a Regenerator as Amoongus, but not a bad addition.Klang/Klinklang - Clear Body - Icy Cave: Plus and Minus are horrible, even in doubles, since KK likes physical attacks better. The only ability it can use, and its not bad for the Pokemon.Elegym/Beheeym - Analytic - Spooky Manor: Slow Pokemon anyway, Synchornise is alright, but usualy Analytic will be superior.Cubchoo/Beartic - Rattled/Swift Swim - Hidden Grotto: Snow Cloak is just bad (and sometimes banned) so these abilities make more sense, though neither are that good on the Pokemon.Gollet/Golurk - No Guard - Spooky Manor: Usable, though i tend to lean towards Iron Fist.Also, Dugtrio with Sand Force is absolutely horrible. It should never run an ability that isn't Arena Trap. Ever. Arena Trap is what makes it good, so i'd hope that gets removed.I don't know if we are including Event/Promotional DW Abiltiies here, since they aren't as easy to access and i don't know about their releases in America. If we are, Blazekin, Infernape, Gothitelle, Venusaur, Charizard, Blastoise, Torterra and the elemental Monkeys all would garner attention on this list."
2012-11-29T12:55:07-0800,"More love for the Icy Cave pls. ^^Sneasel/Weavile - Pickpocket - Definitely better than Pressure on a speed Pokémon - can be useful with Focus Sash.Vanillite/Vanillish/Vanilluxe - Weak Armor - Can be useful for a faster second hit, while Ice Body only makes sense in Hail.Axew/Haxorus - Unnerve - See Ekans/Arbok, more useful than its other abilities."
2012-11-29T16:32:40-0800,"I wish, but no. Weavile has to be holding NOTHING for Pickpocket to work. Use with a berry if you want, but Focus Sash isn't going to work."
2012-11-29T23:06:24-0800,"Also, Haxorus should never be using Unerve. It is not more useful than Mold Breaker getting around Levitiate and Sturdy."
2012-11-30T10:06:45-0800,Lightningrod Seaking is amazing! Rids it of the electric weakness AND boost Sp.Atk.
2012-11-30T15:49:55-0800,But it's funny! Some fish hoping to be zapped swimming around in water.
2012-11-30T19:44:47-0800,I'm waiting for Lightning Rod Zapdos.

2012-11-28T12:30:06-0800,"So, the new DW zone opened up and I was welcomed by a whole bunch of Gulpins with Gluttony and Audinos with Klutz. While, there always seems to be some case in which an ability is useful, even if it doesn't happen a lot, some of these abilities are just plain not useful. And, some Pokemon you find in the Dream World have no Dream World ability, which is confusing.So, I thought it'd be useful if people worked together to create a list of Pokemon worth going after in the Dream World because of their Dream World ability.Only catch is that they have to be available NOW in the North America game.Anyone have any other suggestions?IN DREAM WORLDDREAM PARKCombee-> Vespiquen - Hustle/Unerve - Hidden Grotto/Dream Park: Bad Pokemon, but both of them enjoy their DW ability. Vespiquen's regular ability isnt unusable though, some sets will prefer Pressure, but shutting off Lum Berry helps it Toxic Stall, which is all it does.Zangoose- Toxic Boost - Hidden Grotto/Dream Park: A signature dream world ability is pretty cool, and this works better on Zangoose than Immunity in every way, so why not?Shroomish-> Breeloom - Quick Feet/Technician -Dream Park/Hidden Grotto: Quick Feet is cute and alright but TechLoom is a monster. Mach Punch/Low Sweep/Bullet Seed/Spore or Stone Edge. that's all you'll ever need.Heracross-Moxie - Hidden Grotto/Dream Park: If you have a Heracross and it's not a MoxieCross, it should probably be a MoxieCross.Scraggy-> Scrafty - Intimidate - I've heard good things about Intimidate Scraggy. Useful for switching into fights and Scraggy is a pretty strong fighter to begin with, so it helps him fight off worthy physical attackers.Ekans-> Arbok - Unnerve - Being able to stop berries like Lum, Sitrus, and type-resist is amazing. Intimidate is a great ability too, but Unnerve has its uses.Grimer-> Muk - Poison Touch - Dream Park/Hidden Grotto: ...It is better than it's other abilities. Never really played with it. Maybe I shouldPinsir- Moxie - Dream Park/Hidden Grotto: Best ability for it. Gives +1 attack for each KO it gets.PLEASANT FORESTTympole-> Palpitoad -> Siesmetoad - Water Absorb - Pleasent Forest: Immunity abilities on common types are good, and quite standard on Water/Ground types. It works better than most of his abilities in most cases.Pachirisu- Volt Absorb - Pleasent Forest/Hidden Grotto: Its other abilities both do literally nothing, so anythign is an improvement.Shinx-> Luxio -> Luxray - Guts - Pleasent Forest: Awful Pokemon, but it reallyonly has two sets you could ever hope to use, and Guts is one fo them.GirafarigorStantlerorMiltank- Sap Sipper - Pleasent Forest: None of these Pokemon mind Sap Sipper, all can use it decently, but its not the clear cut ability on any of them either.Poochyena-> Mightyenna - Rattled/Moxie - Pleasent Forest: Poochyenna doesn't really care what ability he has, but Mightyenna can start to function as a halfway decent Pokemon with Sucker Punch/Crunch and Moxie in its arsenal.Tauros- Sheer Force - Pleasent Forest: Sheer Force is really just too good. Every Pokemon appreciates it.Natu-> Xatu - Magic Bounce - Pleasent Forest: Magic Bounce is the only reason to use Xatu. The number fo moves it makes completely useless is staggering.Doduo-> Dodrio - Tangled Feet - Pleasent Forest: None of its other abilities are great, and Tangled Feet lets you use a Choice Banded Thrash (now 120 BP) without ever becoming confused, which makes use of its decent attack and good speed.Nidoran F-> Nidorina -> Nidoqueen orNidoran M-> Nidorino -> Nidoking - Sheer Force - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: The best ability they get and a movepool to match. Pair it up with Life Orb (get the boost in power, but the ability negates the self-damage) and you won't need to worry about the stats it has. Being able to use Ice Beam, Earth Power, Sludge Bomb, Thunderbolt, etc means you will hit almost everything for super-effective AND have the ability AND life orb to boot.Vulpix-> Ninetales - Drought - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: Takes Groudon's ability and brings it into legal use in competitions. Being able to increase it's own fire attacks, enable 1-turn solarbeams, and turn on Chlorophyll is an amazing ability.Poliwag-> Poliwhirl -> Poliwrath - Swift Swim - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: Poliwrath is a pretty decent physical attacker, a rare sight in rain teams. Now with double the speed he can make good use of it.Poliwag-> Poliwhirl -> Politoed - Drizzle - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: Kyogres ability in tournament legal form. This guy has seen TONS of use, enabling water pokemon to get more attack power AND enable Swift Swim. You are bound to see this guy pretty often.Rattata-> Raticate - Hustle - Pleasant Forest: Adds a ton of power to an underwhelming pokemon. Guts has the same boost, but I like having HP for a focus sash.Psyduck-> Golduck - Swift Swim - Pleasant Forest: Double speed in the rain? Great! Not much a move pool, but it is better than Damp for sure.Exeggcute-> Exeggutor - Harvest - Pleasant Forest: Harvest has a 50% chance of bringing back a used berry every turn, or 100% guaranteed while the sun is out. Sitrus? Type resist berry? Get them back with Harvest.Lickitung-> Lickilicky - Cloud Nine - Pleasant Forest: Being able to put a stop the the Rain, Sun, and Sand teams people use quite commonly is a great niche in the game. And being the best pokemon to use Explosion is always nice.Tangela-> Tangrowth Regenerator - Pleasant Forest: See Slowpoke, but with Giga drain and other healing moves also.Kangaskhan- Inner Focus - Pleasant Forest: See Meowth/Persian.SPARKLING SEAAlomomola- Regenerator - Sparkling Sea: Not as good a Regenerator as Amoongus, but not a bad addition.Buizel-> Floatzel - Water Veil - Sparkling Sea: They can run either ability, but Switcherro/Flame Orb/Water Veil is a very cool niche this Pokemon has.Barboach-> Wishcash - Hydration - Sparkling Sea; I have used this thign in competitve battling where no one took it seriously and swept teams 6-0 with this guy. Rest/DD/Earthwuake/Waterfall in the rain can do so much damage it isnt even funny. And there is just something gratifying about using a Wishcash when you beat someoneCorpish-> Crawdaunt - Adaptability - Sparkling Sea: Crawdaunt is the only Adaptability Poke with two typings, making it dangerous already. Add in Dragon Dance and you can have an amazingly proficeiant sweeper. If only it got Aqua Jet :/Lileep-> Cradily - Storm Drain - Sparkling Sea: Lots of sea critters with great DW abilities. Storm Drain turns a neuatral hit into a healing immunity, which allows Cradily to set up Stockpiles easier.Anorith-> Armaldo - Swift Swim - Sparkling Sea: Seriously, so much Sparklign sea in a row o.o Swift Swim is decent on these pokes, but they just aren't good Pokemon inof themselves.Carvanha-> Sharpedo - Speed Boost - Sparkling Sea: Gotta go fastQwilfish- Intimidate - Skarling Sea: Makes better use of his decent typing to wall fighting types and fire types in long enough to set up some hazards.Wooper-> Quagsire - Unburden - Sparkling Sea: make Quagsire an excellent wall with Curse and Recover.Krabby-> Kingler - Sheer Force - Sparkling Sea/Hidden Grotto: His other abilities dont really help, and Sheer Force is an amazing ability. Its not as suited to him as some Pokemon, but its better than nothing.Dratini-> Dragonair -> Dragonite - Multiscale - Sparkling Sea/Hidden Grotto: When at full HP the damage you take is halved. This with Roost makes him quite the tank.Goldeen-> Seaking - Lightningrod - Sparkling Sea: See PikachuMagikarp-> Gyarados - Moxie - Sparkling Sea: See PinsirLapras- Hydration - Sparkling Sea: Heals status conditions in the rain. So you have free use of Rest EVERY turn. Being as defensive as it is, this is an amazing ability for her.Tentacool-> Tentacruel - Rain Dish - Sparkling Sea: Tentacruel is quite the defensive pokemon, and in the rain he will heal off what damage he will be taking. MUCH better than Liquid ooze ever will be.Slowpoke-> Slowbro -> Slowking - Regenerator - Sparkling Sea/Dream Radar: Slowbro/king are VERY defensive. Being able to set up a trick room throw a few attacks out, and switch to get some auto healing is amazing. Hands down his best ability.ICY CAVEKlang-> Klinklang - Clear Body - Icy Cave: Plus and Minus are horrible, even in doubles, since KK likes physical attacks better. The only ability it can use, and its not bad for the Pokemon.Gible-> Gabite -> Garchomp- Rough Skin - Icy Cave: Not sure why Gible would hang out near Ice, but Rough Skin is a decent ability, especially when playign where Sand Veil is banned.Snorunt-> Froslass - Cursed Body - Icy Cave: I'm not touching on any Pokemon with Moody because its a broken ability banned in every metagame i'll ever play, so ignore Snowrunt. But Cursed Body cna allow this Pokemon to set up Spikes and Destiny Bonds easier.Swinub-> Piloswine -> Mamoswine - Thick Fat - Icy Cave: An extra resistance and cancelation of a weakness with Mamo's handful of usable moves still available is too good to pass up.Diglett-> Dugtrio - Sand Force - Icy Cave: Dugtrio is already really fast, so why not just increase its power in a sandstorm? Earthquake and Rock Slide become deadly on this guy.Voltorb-> Electrode - Aftermath - Icy Cave: This is a toss up between Static and this. Both are very sub par but that is what they get.Sandshrew-> Sandslash - Sand Rush - Icy Cave: Sand rush makes Sandslash mildly usable as an offesnive Pokemon, something its previously never been able to do better than somethign else. Still outclassed by Excadrill, but better than it has been.SPOOKY MANORGolett-> Golurk - No Guard - Spooky Manor: Usable, though i tend to lean towards Iron Fist.Elegym-> Beheeym - Analytic - Spooky Manor: Slow Pokemon anyway, Synchornise is alright, but usualy Analytic will be superior.Sableye- Prankster - Spooky Manor/Nimbasa (BW2) : Sableye has a rediculous number of options to go alongside Prankster, that can easily shut down physically offesnive or set up Pokemon.VolbeatorIllumise- Prankster - Spooky Manor: Really this is Volbeat's blessing with Tail Glow/Baton pass, but Illumise doesnt have much else going for it.Ralts-> Kirlia -> Gallade - Justified -Spooky Manor/Nimbasa City (BLW2): You have to get a Ralts to get it, but Ralts' ability is worse than its usual ones. Justified however gives Gallade a way to raise his attack, which is usually better than Steadfast.Smoochum-> Jynx - Hydration/Dry Skin - Spooky Manor: Giving Jynx an immunity to Water can easily give you a free turn to use Lovely Kiss, Substitute, Nasty Plot or just go ont he offensive, and the constant healing under Rain is also quite nice.Meowth-> Persian - Unnerve - Spooky Manor/Minbasa City trade: See Arbok, but able to use Fake Out as well.Abra-> Kadabra -> Alakazam - Magic Guard - Spooky Manor: Magic Guard protects from all passive damage, be it Hail, Sand, Burn, Poison or...wait for it...Life orb! Alakazam already has an amazing special attack but back it up with Life orb without the self-damage, you will be getting KO's left and right.Drowzee-> Hypno - Inner Focus - Spooky Manor: Being able to throw a Hypnosis without fear of taking a Fake out is great. The best ability for this pokemon.RUGGED MOUNTAINMaractus- Storm Drain - Rugged Mountain: Better than Water Asborb, even though it does about the same thing.Burmy-> Mothim - Tinted Lens - Pokemon Cafe Forest/Rugged Mountain: Bad Pokemon, its prevos don't want their DW abilities, but this one is slightly better than Swarm.Bagon-> Shelgon -> Salamence - Sheer Force/Overcoat/Moxie - Rugged Mountain/Hidden Grotto: Moxiemence is the big claim to fame here, but the others don't hate their abilities either. But seriously. Moxiemence. Moxie is one of those abiltiies that blesses every Pokemon it touches. And Salamence is the peak of the Moxie Mountain.Spinda- Contrary - Rugged Mountain/Nimbasa (BW2): Super Power Contrary Spinda is fun, and more usable than anything else it could ever do.Cacnea-> Cacturne - Water Absorb - Rugged Mountain: If you aren't using Sand, or are playign in a metagame where Sand Veil is banned, this is the best ability for it.Tyrogue-> Hitmonlee - Vital Spirit/Unburden - Rugged Mountain: Not the best for Tyrogue, but Unburden, alongside Normal Gem and Fake Out make Hitmonlee a dangerously fast and powerful sweeper.Mankey-> Primeape - Defiant - Rugged Mountain: It's best ability. Get intimidated? Get that attack back +1 extra. Icy wind? More attack. Get the picture?Magnemite-> Magneton -> Magnezone - Analytic - Rugged Mountain: Since these guys are so slow, you are almost guaranteed to get the Analytic boost. Backed by its high special attack and defense you are sure to make use of it.WINDSWEPT SKYDucklett-> Swanna - Hydration - Windswept Sky: Better than the other two abilities, and Swanna really wants Rain support for its dual STABs.Emolga- Motor Drive - Windswept Sky: Emolga is frail, so anything that lets it not take a hit is good.Pidove-> Tranquil -> Unfezant - Rivalry - Windswept Sky: None of its abilities are good, but this is a usable option.Drifloon-> Drifblim - Flare Boost - Windwept Sky: Getting the other half of Zangoose's ability, these Pokemon have 3 abilities that are all useful, and all for vary different roles.Starly ->Staravia-> Staraptor - Reckless - Windswept Sky: Added damage to its two best STAB moves make it an even more dangerous Pokemon.Tropius- Harvest - Windswept Sky: Worse than the Eggs at using it, but better than non-Harvest Tropius.Swablu-> Altaria - Cloud Nine - Windswept Sky/Hidden Grotto: An equally good ability as Natural Cure. Shutting down weather is better in doubles, Nautral Cure is better in singles, but both are worth noting.Wingull-> Pelipper - Rain Dish - Windswept Sky: Keen Eye is bad, Rain Dish is ok. Keen Eye is really, really bad.Murkrow-> Honchkrow - Prankster/Moxie - Windswept Sky/Hidden Grotto: Both abilities that perfectly compliment what the Pokemon can do, better than any other ability they have access to.Gligar-> Gliscor - Immunity/Poison Heal - Windswept Sky/Hidden Grotto: Again, both Pokemon get abilities that allow them to function best at what they are meant to do.Aerodactyl- Unnerve - Windswept Sky: See Ekans/Arbok.Spearow-> Fearow - Sniper - Windswept Sky: Fearow is actually a cool Poke with the introduction of Drill Run. And Keen Eye is one of the worst abilities ever, so Sniper is a major improvement.IN-GAMEHIDDEN GROTTOCubchoo-> Beartic - Rattled/Swift Swim - Hidden Grotto: Snow Cloak is just bad (and sometimes banned) so these abilities make more sense, though neither are that good on the Pokemon.Foongus-> Amoongus - Regenerator - Hidden Grotto: Big big winner. Regenerator Amoongus replaces all other Amoongus. Not even outclasses, replaces. You use it with Regenerator, or you don't use it. Period.Trubbish-> Garbodor - Aftermath - Hidden Grotto: More useful in most cases as he sets up hazards.Mincinno-> Cinccino - Skill Link - Hidden Grotto: Yes on all accounts. This is the only way to use this Pokemon, and it packs such a punch. Three different moves that will hit 5 times guaranteed providing decent coverage on non Steel types, with Wake Up Slap or U-turn as good 4th moves for that.Blitzle-> Zebstrika - Sap Sipper - Hidden Grotto: All their abilities are immunity abilities, so you can tailor it to whatever you want. Nice that it can't be Spored i suppose.Woobat-> Swoobat - Simple - Hidden Grotto: Awww yeah. Simple Calm Mind for days. Great ability.Lillipup-> Herdier -> Stoutland - Scrappy - Hidden Grotto: Sand Rush is usually better, but if you arent using Sand, being able to nail Ghosts with STAB Return frees you up from needing Crunch, and makes Choiced Sets better.Purrloin-> Liepard - Prankster - Hidden Grotto: Swagger/Sub/Foul Play is a fun set. No Pokemon really dislikes Prankster as an ability, but this is not one of the better users of it.Pachirisu- Volt Absorb - Pleasent Forest/Hidden Grotto: Its other abilities both do literally nothing, so anythign is an improvement.Combee-> Vespiquen - Hustle/Unerve - Hidden Grotto/Dream Park: Bad Pokemon, but both of them enjoy their DW ability. Vespiquen's regular ability isnt unusable though, some sets will prefer Pressure, but shutting off Lum Berry helps it Toxic Stall, which is all it does.Bagon-> Shelgon -> Salamence - Sheer Force/Overcoat/Moxie - Rugged Mountain/Hidden Grotto: Moxiemence is the big claim to fame here, but the others don't hate their abilities either. But seriously. Moxiemence. Moxie is one of those abiltiies that blesses every Pokemon it touches. And Salamence is the peak of the Moxie Mountain.Zangoose- Toxic Boost - Hidden Grotto/Dream Park: A signature dream world ability is pretty cool, and this works better on Zangoose than Immunity in every way, so why not?Swablu-> Altaria - Cloud Nine - Windswept Sky/Hidden Grotto: An equally good ability as Natural Cure. Shutting down weather is better in doubles, Nautral Cure is better in singles, but both are worth noting.Shroomish-> Breeloom - Quick Feet/Technician -Dream Park/Hidden Grotto: Quick Feet is cute and alright but TechLoom is a monster. Mach Punch/Low Sweep/Bullet Seed/Spore or Stone Edge. that's all you'll ever need.Heracross-Moxie - Hidden Grotto/Dream Park: If you have a Heracross and it's not a MoxieCross, it should probably be a MoxieCross.Murkrow-> Honchkrow - Prankster/Moxie - Windswept Sky/Hidden Grotto: Both abilities that perfectly compliment what the Pokemon can do, better than any other ability they have access to.Gligar-> Gliscor - Immunity/Poison Heal - Windswept Sky/Hidden Grotto: Again, both Pokemon get abilities that allow them to function best at what they are meant to do.Krabby-> Kingler - Sheer Force - Sparkling Sea/Hidden Grotto: His other abilities dont really help, and Sheer Force is an amazing ability.

This with Roost makes him quite the tank.Poliwag-> Poliwhirl -> Poliwrath - Swift Swim - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: Poliwrath is a pretty decent physical attacker, a rare sight in rain teams.

Justified however gives Gallade a way to raise his attack, which is usually better than Steadfast.Pichu-> Pikachu -> Raichu - Lightningrod - World Champs '12/breeding: AMAZING ABILITY. Being able to boost your special attack from an accurate switch in or discharge from your other pokemon is amazing. Add on the light ball and Pikachu is now reaching devastating levels of special attack.Eevee-evolutions- multiple uses for multiple pokemon. I may update this later.Slowpoke-> Slowbro -> Slowking - Regenerator - Sparkling Sea/Dream Radar: Slowbro/king are VERY defensive. Being able to set up a trick room throw a few attacks out, and switch to get some auto healing is amazing. Hands down his best ability."
2012-11-28T18:00:27-0800,"Useful as I have said before is in the eye of the beholder but some are more obvious than others. Here is my list (starting at the top of the pokedex, by availability to the USA/PAL regions. This is going to be a long list.Rattata/Raticate - Hustle - Pleasant Forest: Adds a ton of power to an underwhelming pokemon. Guts has the same boost, but I like having HP for a focus sash.Ekans/Arbok - Unnerve - Dream Park: Being able to stop berries like Lum, Sitrus, and type-resist is amazing.

2012-11-29T08:50:41-0800,"Holy wall of text Batman!Does Harvest bring back a berry used more than one turn ago, or is it a one-time 50% or 100% chance to return the berry, and then more chance if the berry is brought back?Lightning Rod on Seaking is funny!Imposter on Ditto is amazing!"
2012-11-29T11:23:35-0800,"Spearow/Fearow - Sniper - Windswept Sky: Fearow is actually a cool Poke with the introduction of Drill Run. And Keen Eye is one of the worst abilities ever, so Sniper is a major improvement.Sandshrew/Sandslash - Sand Rush - Icy Cave: Sand rush makes Sandslash mildly usable as an offesnive Pokemon, something its previously never been able to do better than somethign else. Still outclassed by Excadrill, but better than it has been.Doduo/Dodrio - Tangled Feet - Pleasent Forest: None of its other abilities are great, and Tangled Feet lets you use a Choice Banded Thrash (now 120 BP) without ever becoming confused, which makes use of its decent attack and good speed.Krabby/Kingler - Sheer Force - Sparkling Sea/Hidden Grotto: His other abilities dont really help, and Sheer Force is an amazing ability. Its not as suited to him as some Pokemon, but its better than nothing.Tyrogue/Hitmonlee - Vital Spirit/Unburden - Rugged Mountain: Not the best for Tyrogue, but Unburden, alongside Normal Gem and Fake Out make Hitmonlee a dangerously fast and powerful sweeper.Smoochum/Jynx - Hydration/Dry Skin - Spooky Manor: Giving Jynx an immunity to Water can easily give you a free turn to use Lovely Kiss, Substitute, Nasty Plot or just go ont he offensive, and the constant healing under Rain is also quite nice.Taurous - Sheer Force - Pleasent Forest: Sheer Force is really just too good. Every Pokemon appreciates it.Natu/Xatu - Magic Bounce - Pleasent Forest: Magic Bounce is the only reason to use Xatu. The number fo moves it makes completely useless is staggering.Wooper/Quagsire - Unburden - Sparkling Sea: make Quagsire an excellent wall with Curse and Recover.Murkrow/Honchkrow - Prankster/Moxie - Windswept Sky/Hidden Grotto: Both abilities that perfectly compliment what the Pokemon can do, better than any other ability they have access to.Gligar/Gliscor - Immunity/Poison Heal - Windswept Sky/Hidden Grotto: Again, both Pokemon get abilities that allow them to function best at what they are meant to do.Qwilfish - Intimidate - Skarling Sea: Makes better use of his decent typing to wall fighting types and fire types in long enough to set up some hazards.HERACROSS -Moxie - Hidden Grotto/Dream Park: If you have a Heracross and it's not a MoxieCross, it should probably be a MoxieCross.Swinub/Piloswine/Mamoswine - Thick Fat - Icy Cave: An extra resistance and cancelation of a weakness with Mamo's handful of usable moves still available is too good to pass up.Girafarig/Stantler/Miltank - Sap Sipper - Pleasent Forest: None of these Pokemon mind Sap Sipper, all can use it decently, but its not the clear cut ability on any of them either.Poochyena/Mightyenna - Rattled/Moxie - Pleasent Forest: Poochyenna doesn't really care what ability he has, but Mightyenna can start to function as a halfway decent Pokemon with Sucker Punch/Crunch and Moxie in its arsenal.Wingull/Pelipper - Rain Dish - Windswept Sky: Keen Eye is bad, Rain Dish is ok. Keen Eye is really, really bad.Gallade - Justified -Spooky Manor/Nimbasa City (BLW2): You have to get a Ralts to get it, but Ralts' ability is worse than its usual ones. Justified however gives Gallade a way to raise his attack, which is usually better than Steadfast.Shroomish/BREELOOM - Quick Feet/Technician -Dream Park/Hidden Grotto: Quick Feet is cute and alright but TechLoom is a monster.

Rest/DD/Earthwuake/Waterfall in the rain can do so much damage it isnt even funny. And there is just something gratifying about using a Wishcash when you beat someoneCorpish/Crawdaunt - Adaptability - Sparkling Sea: Crawdaunt is the only Adaptability Poke with two typings, making it dangerous already. Add in Dragon Dance and you can have an amazingly proficeiant sweeper. If only it got Aqua Jet :/Lileep/Cradily - Storm Drain - Sparkling Sea: Lots of sea critters with great DW abilities. Storm Drain turns a neuatral hit into a healing immunity, which allows Cradily to set up Stockpiles easier.Anorith/Armaldo - Swift Swim - Sparkling Sea: Seriously, so much Sparklign sea in a row o.o Swift Swim is decent on these pokes, but they just aren't good Pokemon inof themselves.Tropius - Harvest - Windswept Sky: Worse than the Eggs at using it, but better than non-Harvest Tropius.Froslass - Cursed Body - Icy Cave: I'm not touching on any Pokemon with Moody because its a broken ability banned in every metagame i'll ever play, so ignore Snowrunt. But Cursed Body cna allow this Pokemon to set up Spikes and Destiny Bonds easier.Bagon/Shelgon/SALAMENCE - Sheer Force/Overcoat/Moxie - Rugged Mountain/Hidden Grotto: Moxiemence is the big claim to fame here, but the others don't hate their abilities either. But seriously. Moxiemence. Moxie is one of those abiltiies that blesses every Pokemon it touches. And Salamence is the peak of the Moxie Mountain.Staravia/Staraptor - Reckless - Windswept Sky: Added damage to its two best STAB moves make it an even more dangerous Pokemon.Shinx/Luxio/Luxray - Guts - Pleasent Forest: Awful Pokemon, but it reallyonly has two sets you could ever hope to use, and Guts is one fo them.Mothim - Tinted Lens - Pokemon Cafe Forest/Rugged Mountain: Bad Pokemon, its prevos don't want their DW abilities, but this one is slightly better than Swarm.Combee/Vespiquen - Hustle/Unerve - Hidden Grotto/Dream Park: Bad Pokemon, but both of them enjoy their DW ability. Vespiquen's regular ability isnt unusable though, some sets will prefer Pressure, but shutting off Lum Berry helps it Toxic Stall, which is all it does.Pachirisu - Volt Absorb - Pleasent Forest/Hidden Grotto: Its other abilities both do literally nothing, so anythign is an improvement.Buizel/Floatzel - Water Veil - Sparkling Sea: They can run either ability, but Switcherro/Flame Orb/Water Veil is a very cool niche this Pokemon has.Drifloon/Drifblim - Flare Boost - Windwept Sky: Getting the other half of Zangoose's ability, these Pokemon have 3 abilities that are all useful, and all for vary different roles.Gible/Gabite/Garchomp- Rough Skin - Icy Cave: Not sure why Gible would hang out near Ice, but Rough Skin is a decent ability, especially when playign where Sand Veil is banned.Herdier/Stoutland - Scrappy - Hidden Grotto: Sand Rush is usually better, but if you arent using Sand, being able to nail Ghosts with STAB Return frees you up from needing Crunch, and makes Choiced Sets better.Purrloin/Liepard - Prankster - Hidden Grotto: Swagger/Sub/Foul Play is a fun set. No Pokemon really dislikes Prankster as an ability, but this is not one of the better users of it.Pidove/Tranquil/Unfezant - Rivalry - Windswept Sky: None of its abilities are good, but this is a usable option.Blitzle/Zebstrika - Sap Sipper - Hidden Grotto: All their abilities are immunity abilities, so you can tailor it to whatever you want. Nice that it can't be Spored i suppose.Woobat/Swoobat - Simple - Hidden Grotto: Awww yeah. Simple Calm Mind for days. Great ability.Tympole/Palpitoad/Siesmetoad - Water Absorb - Pleasent Forest: Immunity abilities on common types are good, and quite standard on Water/Ground types. It works better than most of his abilities in most cases.Maractus - Storm Drain - Rugged Mountain: Better than Water Asborb, even though it does about the same thing.Trubbish/Garbodor - Aftermath - Hidden Grotto: More useful in most cases as he sets up hazards.Mincinno/CINCCINO - Skill Link - Hidden Grotto: Yes on all accounts. This is the only way to use this Pokemon, and it packs such a punch. Three different moves that will hit 5 times guaranteed providing decent coverage on non Steel types, with Wake Up Slap or U-turn as good 4th moves for that.Ducklett/Swanna - Hydration - Windswept Sky: Better thant he other two abilities, and Swanna really wants Rain support for its dual STABs.Emolga - Motor Drive - Windswept Sky: Emolga is frail, so anything that lets it not take a hit is good.Foongus/AMOONGUS - Regenerator - Hidden Grotto: Big big winner. Regenerator Amoongus replaces all other Amoongus. Not even outclasses, replaces. You use it with Regenerator, or you don't use it. Period.Alomomola - Regenerator - Sparkling Sea: Not as good a Regenerator as Amoongus, but not a bad addition.Klang/Klinklang - Clear Body - Icy Cave: Plus and Minus are horrible, even in doubles, since KK likes physical attacks better. The only ability it can use, and its not bad for the Pokemon.Elegym/Beheeym - Analytic - Spooky Manor: Slow Pokemon anyway, Synchornise is alright, but usualy Analytic will be superior.Cubchoo/Beartic - Rattled/Swift Swim - Hidden Grotto: Snow Cloak is just bad (and sometimes banned) so these abilities make more sense, though neither are that good on the Pokemon.Gollet/Golurk - No Guard - Spooky Manor: Usable, though i tend to lean towards Iron Fist.Also, Dugtrio with Sand Force is absolutely horrible. It should never run an ability that isn't Arena Trap. Ever. Arena Trap is what makes it good, so i'd hope that gets removed.I don't know if we are including Event/Promotional DW Abiltiies here, since they aren't as easy to access and i don't know about their releases in America. If we are, Blazekin, Infernape, Gothitelle, Venusaur, Charizard, Blastoise, Torterra and the elemental Monkeys all would garner attention on this list."
2012-11-29T12:55:07-0800,"More love for the Icy Cave pls. ^^Sneasel/Weavile - Pickpocket - Definitely better than Pressure on a speed Pokémon - can be useful with Focus Sash.Vanillite/Vanillish/Vanilluxe - Weak Armor - Can be useful for a faster second hit, while Ice Body only makes sense in Hail.Axew/Haxorus - Unnerve - See Ekans/Arbok, more useful than its other abilities."
2012-11-29T16:32:40-0800,"I wish, but no. Weavile has to be holding NOTHING for Pickpocket to work. Use with a berry if you want, but Focus Sash isn't going to work."
2012-11-29T23:06:24-0800,"Also, Haxorus should never be using Unerve. It is not more useful than Mold Breaker getting around Levitiate and Sturdy."
2012-11-30T10:06:45-0800,Lightningrod Seaking is amazing! Rids it of the electric weakness AND boost Sp.Atk.
2012-11-30T15:49:55-0800,But it's funny! Some fish hoping to be zapped swimming around in water.
2012-11-30T19:44:47-0800,I'm waiting for Lightning Rod Zapdos.
2012-11-30T22:51:15-0800,"Harvest has a chance to activate every turn, kinda like Shed Skin and the like."

2012-11-28T12:30:06-0800,"So, the new DW zone opened up and I was welcomed by a whole bunch of Gulpins with Gluttony and Audinos with Klutz. While, there always seems to be some case in which an ability is useful, even if it doesn't happen a lot, some of these abilities are just plain not useful. And, some Pokemon you find in the Dream World have no Dream World ability, which is confusing.So, I thought it'd be useful if people worked together to create a list of Pokemon worth going after in the Dream World because of their Dream World ability.Only catch is that they have to be available NOW in the North America game.Anyone have any other suggestions?IN DREAM WORLDDREAM PARKCombee-> Vespiquen - Hustle/Unerve - Hidden Grotto/Dream Park: Bad Pokemon, but both of them enjoy their DW ability. Vespiquen's regular ability isnt unusable though, some sets will prefer Pressure, but shutting off Lum Berry helps it Toxic Stall, which is all it does.Zangoose- Toxic Boost - Hidden Grotto/Dream Park: A signature dream world ability is pretty cool, and this works better on Zangoose than Immunity in every way, so why not?Shroomish-> Breeloom - Quick Feet/Technician -Dream Park/Hidden Grotto: Quick Feet is cute and alright but TechLoom is a monster. Mach Punch/Low Sweep/Bullet Seed/Spore or Stone Edge. that's all you'll ever need.Heracross-Moxie - Hidden Grotto/Dream Park: If you have a Heracross and it's not a MoxieCross, it should probably be a MoxieCross.Scraggy-> Scrafty - Intimidate - I've heard good things about Intimidate Scraggy. Useful for switching into fights and Scraggy is a pretty strong fighter to begin with, so it helps him fight off worthy physical attackers.Ekans-> Arbok - Unnerve - Being able to stop berries like Lum, Sitrus, and type-resist is amazing. Intimidate is a great ability too, but Unnerve has its uses.Grimer-> Muk - Poison Touch - Dream Park/Hidden Grotto: ...It is better than it's other abilities. Never really played with it. Maybe I shouldPinsir- Moxie - Dream Park/Hidden Grotto: Best ability for it. Gives +1 attack for each KO it gets.PLEASANT FORESTTympole-> Palpitoad -> Siesmetoad - Water Absorb - Pleasent Forest: Immunity abilities on common types are good, and quite standard on Water/Ground types. It works better than most of his abilities in most cases.Pachirisu- Volt Absorb - Pleasent Forest/Hidden Grotto: Its other abilities both do literally nothing, so anythign is an improvement.Shinx-> Luxio -> Luxray - Guts - Pleasent Forest: Awful Pokemon, but it reallyonly has two sets you could ever hope to use, and Guts is one fo them.GirafarigorStantlerorMiltank- Sap Sipper - Pleasent Forest: None of these Pokemon mind Sap Sipper, all can use it decently, but its not the clear cut ability on any of them either.Poochyena-> Mightyenna - Rattled/Moxie - Pleasent Forest: Poochyenna doesn't really care what ability he has, but Mightyenna can start to function as a halfway decent Pokemon with Sucker Punch/Crunch and Moxie in its arsenal.Tauros- Sheer Force - Pleasent Forest: Sheer Force is really just too good. Every Pokemon appreciates it.Natu-> Xatu - Magic Bounce - Pleasent Forest: Magic Bounce is the only reason to use Xatu. The number fo moves it makes completely useless is staggering.Doduo-> Dodrio - Tangled Feet - Pleasent Forest: None of its other abilities are great, and Tangled Feet lets you use a Choice Banded Thrash (now 120 BP) without ever becoming confused, which makes use of its decent attack and good speed.Nidoran F-> Nidorina -> Nidoqueen orNidoran M-> Nidorino -> Nidoking - Sheer Force - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: The best ability they get and a movepool to match. Pair it up with Life Orb (get the boost in power, but the ability negates the self-damage) and you won't need to worry about the stats it has. Being able to use Ice Beam, Earth Power, Sludge Bomb, Thunderbolt, etc means you will hit almost everything for super-effective AND have the ability AND life orb to boot.Vulpix-> Ninetales - Drought - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: Takes Groudon's ability and brings it into legal use in competitions. Being able to increase it's own fire attacks, enable 1-turn solarbeams, and turn on Chlorophyll is an amazing ability.Poliwag-> Poliwhirl -> Poliwrath - Swift Swim - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: Poliwrath is a pretty decent physical attacker, a rare sight in rain teams. Now with double the speed he can make good use of it.Poliwag-> Poliwhirl -> Politoed - Drizzle - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: Kyogres ability in tournament legal form. This guy has seen TONS of use, enabling water pokemon to get more attack power AND enable Swift Swim. You are bound to see this guy pretty often.Rattata-> Raticate - Hustle - Pleasant Forest: Adds a ton of power to an underwhelming pokemon. Guts has the same boost, but I like having HP for a focus sash.Psyduck-> Golduck - Swift Swim - Pleasant Forest: Double speed in the rain? Great! Not much a move pool, but it is better than Damp for sure.Exeggcute-> Exeggutor - Harvest - Pleasant Forest: Harvest has a 50% chance of bringing back a used berry every turn, or 100% guaranteed while the sun is out. Sitrus? Type resist berry? Get them back with Harvest.Lickitung-> Lickilicky - Cloud Nine - Pleasant Forest: Being able to put a stop the the Rain, Sun, and Sand teams people use quite commonly is a great niche in the game. And being the best pokemon to use Explosion is always nice.Tangela-> Tangrowth Regenerator - Pleasant Forest: See Slowpoke, but with Giga drain and other healing moves also.Kangaskhan- Inner Focus - Pleasant Forest: See Meowth/Persian.SPARKLING SEAAlomomola- Regenerator - Sparkling Sea: Not as good a Regenerator as Amoongus, but not a bad addition.Buizel-> Floatzel - Water Veil - Sparkling Sea: They can run either ability, but Switcherro/Flame Orb/Water Veil is a very cool niche this Pokemon has.Barboach-> Wishcash - Hydration - Sparkling Sea; I have used this thign in competitve battling where no one took it seriously and swept teams 6-0 with this guy. Rest/DD/Earthwuake/Waterfall in the rain can do so much damage it isnt even funny. And there is just something gratifying about using a Wishcash when you beat someoneCorpish-> Crawdaunt - Adaptability - Sparkling Sea: Crawdaunt is the only Adaptability Poke with two typings, making it dangerous already. Add in Dragon Dance and you can have an amazingly proficeiant sweeper. If only it got Aqua Jet :/Lileep-> Cradily - Storm Drain - Sparkling Sea: Lots of sea critters with great DW abilities. Storm Drain turns a neuatral hit into a healing immunity, which allows Cradily to set up Stockpiles easier.Anorith-> Armaldo - Swift Swim - Sparkling Sea: Seriously, so much Sparklign sea in a row o.o Swift Swim is decent on these pokes, but they just aren't good Pokemon inof themselves.Carvanha-> Sharpedo - Speed Boost - Sparkling Sea: Gotta go fastQwilfish- Intimidate - Skarling Sea: Makes better use of his decent typing to wall fighting types and fire types in long enough to set up some hazards.Wooper-> Quagsire - Unburden - Sparkling Sea: make Quagsire an excellent wall with Curse and Recover.Krabby-> Kingler - Sheer Force - Sparkling Sea/Hidden Grotto: His other abilities dont really help, and Sheer Force is an amazing ability. Its not as suited to him as some Pokemon, but its better than nothing.Dratini-> Dragonair -> Dragonite - Multiscale - Sparkling Sea/Hidden Grotto: When at full HP the damage you take is halved. This with Roost makes him quite the tank.Goldeen-> Seaking - Lightningrod - Sparkling Sea: See PikachuMagikarp-> Gyarados - Moxie - Sparkling Sea: See PinsirLapras- Hydration - Sparkling Sea: Heals status conditions in the rain. So you have free use of Rest EVERY turn. Being as defensive as it is, this is an amazing ability for her.Tentacool-> Tentacruel - Rain Dish - Sparkling Sea: Tentacruel is quite the defensive pokemon, and in the rain he will heal off what damage he will be taking. MUCH better than Liquid ooze ever will be.Slowpoke-> Slowbro -> Slowking - Regenerator - Sparkling Sea/Dream Radar: Slowbro/king are VERY defensive. Being able to set up a trick room throw a few attacks out, and switch to get some auto healing is amazing. Hands down his best ability.ICY CAVEKlang-> Klinklang - Clear Body - Icy Cave: Plus and Minus are horrible, even in doubles, since KK likes physical attacks better. The only ability it can use, and its not bad for the Pokemon.Gible-> Gabite -> Garchomp- Rough Skin - Icy Cave: Not sure why Gible would hang out near Ice, but Rough Skin is a decent ability, especially when playign where Sand Veil is banned.Snorunt-> Froslass - Cursed Body - Icy Cave: I'm not touching on any Pokemon with Moody because its a broken ability banned in every metagame i'll ever play, so ignore Snowrunt. But Cursed Body cna allow this Pokemon to set up Spikes and Destiny Bonds easier.Swinub-> Piloswine -> Mamoswine - Thick Fat - Icy Cave: An extra resistance and cancelation of a weakness with Mamo's handful of usable moves still available is too good to pass up.Diglett-> Dugtrio - Sand Force - Icy Cave: Dugtrio is already really fast, so why not just increase its power in a sandstorm? Earthquake and Rock Slide become deadly on this guy.Voltorb-> Electrode - Aftermath - Icy Cave: This is a toss up between Static and this. Both are very sub par but that is what they get.Sandshrew-> Sandslash - Sand Rush - Icy Cave: Sand rush makes Sandslash mildly usable as an offesnive Pokemon, something its previously never been able to do better than somethign else. Still outclassed by Excadrill, but better than it has been.SPOOKY MANORGolett-> Golurk - No Guard - Spooky Manor: Usable, though i tend to lean towards Iron Fist.Elegym-> Beheeym - Analytic - Spooky Manor: Slow Pokemon anyway, Synchornise is alright, but usualy Analytic will be superior.Sableye- Prankster - Spooky Manor/Nimbasa (BW2) : Sableye has a rediculous number of options to go alongside Prankster, that can easily shut down physically offesnive or set up Pokemon.VolbeatorIllumise- Prankster - Spooky Manor: Really this is Volbeat's blessing with Tail Glow/Baton pass, but Illumise doesnt have much else going for it.Ralts-> Kirlia -> Gallade - Justified -Spooky Manor/Nimbasa City (BLW2): You have to get a Ralts to get it, but Ralts' ability is worse than its usual ones. Justified however gives Gallade a way to raise his attack, which is usually better than Steadfast.Smoochum-> Jynx - Hydration/Dry Skin - Spooky Manor: Giving Jynx an immunity to Water can easily give you a free turn to use Lovely Kiss, Substitute, Nasty Plot or just go ont he offensive, and the constant healing under Rain is also quite nice.Meowth-> Persian - Unnerve - Spooky Manor/Minbasa City trade: See Arbok, but able to use Fake Out as well.Abra-> Kadabra -> Alakazam - Magic Guard - Spooky Manor: Magic Guard protects from all passive damage, be it Hail, Sand, Burn, Poison or...wait for it...Life orb! Alakazam already has an amazing special attack but back it up with Life orb without the self-damage, you will be getting KO's left and right.Drowzee-> Hypno - Inner Focus - Spooky Manor: Being able to throw a Hypnosis without fear of taking a Fake out is great. The best ability for this pokemon.RUGGED MOUNTAINMaractus- Storm Drain - Rugged Mountain: Better than Water Asborb, even though it does about the same thing.Burmy-> Mothim - Tinted Lens - Pokemon Cafe Forest/Rugged Mountain: Bad Pokemon, its prevos don't want their DW abilities, but this one is slightly better than Swarm.Bagon-> Shelgon -> Salamence - Sheer Force/Overcoat/Moxie - Rugged Mountain/Hidden Grotto: Moxiemence is the big claim to fame here, but the others don't hate their abilities either. But seriously. Moxiemence. Moxie is one of those abiltiies that blesses every Pokemon it touches. And Salamence is the peak of the Moxie Mountain.Spinda- Contrary - Rugged Mountain/Nimbasa (BW2): Super Power Contrary Spinda is fun, and more usable than anything else it could ever do.Cacnea-> Cacturne - Water Absorb - Rugged Mountain: If you aren't using Sand, or are playign in a metagame where Sand Veil is banned, this is the best ability for it.Tyrogue-> Hitmonlee - Vital Spirit/Unburden - Rugged Mountain: Not the best for Tyrogue, but Unburden, alongside Normal Gem and Fake Out make Hitmonlee a dangerously fast and powerful sweeper.Mankey-> Primeape - Defiant - Rugged Mountain: It's best ability. Get intimidated? Get that attack back +1 extra. Icy wind? More attack. Get the picture?Magnemite-> Magneton -> Magnezone - Analytic - Rugged Mountain: Since these guys are so slow, you are almost guaranteed to get the Analytic boost. Backed by its high special attack and defense you are sure to make use of it.WINDSWEPT SKYDucklett-> Swanna - Hydration - Windswept Sky: Better than the other two abilities, and Swanna really wants Rain support for its dual STABs.Emolga- Motor Drive - Windswept Sky: Emolga is frail, so anything that lets it not take a hit is good.Pidove-> Tranquil -> Unfezant - Rivalry - Windswept Sky: None of its abilities are good, but this is a usable option.Drifloon-> Drifblim - Flare Boost - Windwept Sky: Getting the other half of Zangoose's ability, these Pokemon have 3 abilities that are all useful, and all for vary different roles.Starly ->Staravia-> Staraptor - Reckless - Windswept Sky: Added damage to its two best STAB moves make it an even more dangerous Pokemon.Tropius- Harvest - Windswept Sky: Worse than the Eggs at using it, but better than non-Harvest Tropius.Swablu-> Altaria - Cloud Nine - Windswept Sky/Hidden Grotto: An equally good ability as Natural Cure. Shutting down weather is better in doubles, Nautral Cure is better in singles, but both are worth noting.Wingull-> Pelipper - Rain Dish - Windswept Sky: Keen Eye is bad, Rain Dish is ok. Keen Eye is really, really bad.Murkrow-> Honchkrow - Prankster/Moxie - Windswept Sky/Hidden Grotto: Both abilities that perfectly compliment what the Pokemon can do, better than any other ability they have access to.Gligar-> Gliscor - Immunity/Poison Heal - Windswept Sky/Hidden Grotto: Again, both Pokemon get abilities that allow them to function best at what they are meant to do.Aerodactyl- Unnerve - Windswept Sky: See Ekans/Arbok.Spearow-> Fearow - Sniper - Windswept Sky: Fearow is actually a cool Poke with the introduction of Drill Run. And Keen Eye is one of the worst abilities ever, so Sniper is a major improvement.IN-GAMEHIDDEN GROTTOCubchoo-> Beartic - Rattled/Swift Swim - Hidden Grotto: Snow Cloak is just bad (and sometimes banned) so these abilities make more sense, though neither are that good on the Pokemon.Foongus-> Amoongus - Regenerator - Hidden Grotto: Big big winner. Regenerator Amoongus replaces all other Amoongus. Not even outclasses, replaces. You use it with Regenerator, or you don't use it. Period.Trubbish-> Garbodor - Aftermath - Hidden Grotto: More useful in most cases as he sets up hazards.Mincinno-> Cinccino - Skill Link - Hidden Grotto: Yes on all accounts. This is the only way to use this Pokemon, and it packs such a punch. Three different moves that will hit 5 times guaranteed providing decent coverage on non Steel types, with Wake Up Slap or U-turn as good 4th moves for that.Blitzle-> Zebstrika - Sap Sipper - Hidden Grotto: All their abilities are immunity abilities, so you can tailor it to whatever you want. Nice that it can't be Spored i suppose.Woobat-> Swoobat - Simple - Hidden Grotto: Awww yeah. Simple Calm Mind for days. Great ability.Lillipup-> Herdier -> Stoutland - Scrappy - Hidden Grotto: Sand Rush is usually better, but if you arent using Sand, being able to nail Ghosts with STAB Return frees you up from needing Crunch, and makes Choiced Sets better.Purrloin-> Liepard - Prankster - Hidden Grotto: Swagger/Sub/Foul Play is a fun set. No Pokemon really dislikes Prankster as an ability, but this is not one of the better users of it.Pachirisu- Volt Absorb - Pleasent Forest/Hidden Grotto: Its other abilities both do literally nothing, so anythign is an improvement.Combee-> Vespiquen - Hustle/Unerve - Hidden Grotto/Dream Park: Bad Pokemon, but both of them enjoy their DW ability. Vespiquen's regular ability isnt unusable though, some sets will prefer Pressure, but shutting off Lum Berry helps it Toxic Stall, which is all it does.Bagon-> Shelgon -> Salamence - Sheer Force/Overcoat/Moxie - Rugged Mountain/Hidden Grotto: Moxiemence is the big claim to fame here, but the others don't hate their abilities either. But seriously. Moxiemence. Moxie is one of those abiltiies that blesses every Pokemon it touches. And Salamence is the peak of the Moxie Mountain.Zangoose- Toxic Boost - Hidden Grotto/Dream Park: A signature dream world ability is pretty cool, and this works better on Zangoose than Immunity in every way, so why not?Swablu-> Altaria - Cloud Nine - Windswept Sky/Hidden Grotto: An equally good ability as Natural Cure. Shutting down weather is better in doubles, Nautral Cure is better in singles, but both are worth noting.Shroomish-> Breeloom - Quick Feet/Technician -Dream Park/Hidden Grotto: Quick Feet is cute and alright but TechLoom is a monster. Mach Punch/Low Sweep/Bullet Seed/Spore or Stone Edge. that's all you'll ever need.Heracross-Moxie - Hidden Grotto/Dream Park: If you have a Heracross and it's not a MoxieCross, it should probably be a MoxieCross.Murkrow-> Honchkrow - Prankster/Moxie - Windswept Sky/Hidden Grotto: Both abilities that perfectly compliment what the Pokemon can do, better than any other ability they have access to.Gligar-> Gliscor - Immunity/Poison Heal - Windswept Sky/Hidden Grotto: Again, both Pokemon get abilities that allow them to function best at what they are meant to do.Krabby-> Kingler - Sheer Force - Sparkling Sea/Hidden Grotto: His other abilities dont really help, and Sheer Force is an amazing ability.

Maybe I shouldPinsir- Moxie - Dream Park/Hidden Grotto: Best ability for it. Gives +1 attack for each KO it gets.Ditto- Imposter - Hidden Grotto: Instant use of Transform without needing the attack. Need I say more?Dratini-> Dragonair -> Dragonite - Multiscale - Sparkling Sea/Hidden Grotto: When at full HP the damage you take is halved. This with Roost makes him quite the tank.Poliwag-> Poliwhirl -> Poliwrath - Swift Swim - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: Poliwrath is a pretty decent physical attacker, a rare sight in rain teams. Now with double the speed he can make good use of it.Poliwag-> Poliwhirl -> Politoed - Drizzle - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: Kyogres ability in tournament legal form.

Being able to use Ice Beam, Earth Power, Sludge Bomb, Thunderbolt, etc means you will hit almost everything for super-effective AND have the ability AND life orb to boot.Vulpix-> Ninetales - Drought - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: Takes Groudon's ability and brings it into legal use in competitions. Being able to increase it's own fire attacks, enable 1-turn solarbeams, and turn on Chlorophyll is an amazing ability.OTHERBurmy-> Mothim - Tinted Lens - Pokemon Cafe Forest/Rugged Mountain: Bad Pokemon, its prevos don't want their DW abilities, but this one is slightly better than Swarm.Spinda- Contrary - Rugged Mountain/Nimbasa (BW2): Super Power Contrary Spinda is fun, and more usable than anything else it could ever do.Sableye- Prankster - Spooky Manor/Nimbasa (BW2) : Sableye has a rediculous number of options to go alongside Prankster, that can easily shut down physically offesnive or set up Pokemon.Ralts-> Kirlia -> Gallade - Justified -Spooky Manor/Nimbasa City (BLW2): You have to get a Ralts to get it, but Ralts' ability is worse than its usual ones. Justified however gives Gallade a way to raise his attack, which is usually better than Steadfast.Pichu-> Pikachu -> Raichu - Lightningrod - World Champs '12/breeding: AMAZING ABILITY. Being able to boost your special attack from an accurate switch in or discharge from your other pokemon is amazing. Add on the light ball and Pikachu is now reaching devastating levels of special attack.Eevee-evolutions- multiple uses for multiple pokemon. I may update this later.Slowpoke-> Slowbro -> Slowking - Regenerator - Sparkling Sea/Dream Radar: Slowbro/king are VERY defensive. Being able to set up a trick room throw a few attacks out, and switch to get some auto healing is amazing. Hands down his best ability."
2012-11-28T18:00:27-0800,"Useful as I have said before is in the eye of the beholder but some are more obvious than others. Here is my list (starting at the top of the pokedex, by availability to the USA/PAL regions. This is going to be a long list.Rattata/Raticate - Hustle - Pleasant Forest: Adds a ton of power to an underwhelming pokemon. Guts has the same boost, but I like having HP for a focus sash.Ekans/Arbok - Unnerve - Dream Park: Being able to stop berries like Lum, Sitrus, and type-resist is amazing. Intimidate is a great ability too, but Unnerve has its uses.Pichu/Pikachu/Raichu - Lightningrod - World Champs '12/breeding: AMAZING ABILITY. Being able to boost your special attack from an accurate switch in or discharge from your other pokemon is amazing. Add on the light ball and Pikachu is now reaching devastating levels of special attack.Nidoqueen/Nidoking - Sheer Force - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: The best ability they get and a movepool to match. Pair it up with Life Orb (get the boost in power, but the ability negates the self-damage) and you won't need to worry about the stats it has. Being able to use Ice Beam, Earth Power, Sludge Bomb, Thunderbolt, etc means you will hit almost everything for super-effective AND have the ability AND life orb to boot.Vulpix/Ninetales - Drought - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: Takes Groudon's ability and brings it into legal use in competitions. Being able to increase it's own fire attacks, enable 1-turn solarbeams, and turn on Chlorophyll is an amazing ability.Diglett/Dugtrio - Sand Force - Icy Cave: Dugtrio is already really fast, so why not just increase its power in a sandstorm? Earthquake and Rock Slide become deadly on this guy.Meowth/Persian - Unnerve - Spooky Manor/Minbasa City trade: See Arbok, but able to use Fake Out as well.Psyduck/Golduck - Swift Swim - Pleasant Forest: Double speed in the rain? Great! Not much a move pool, but it is better than Damp for sure.Mankey/Primeape - Defiant - Rugged Mountain: It's best ability. Get intimidated? Get that attack back +1 extra. Icy wind? More attack. Get the picture?Poliwag/Poliwhirl/Poliwrath - Swift Swim - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: Poliwrath is a pretty decent physical attacker, a rare sight in rain teams. Now with double the speed he can make good use of it.Politoed - Drizzle - Pleasant Forest/Hidden Grotto: Kyogres ability in tournament legal form. This guy has seen TONS of use, enabling water pokemon to get more attack power AND enable Swift Swim. You are bound to see this guy pretty often.Abra/Kadabra/Alakazam - Magic Guard - Spooky Manor: Magic Guard protects from all passive damage, be it Hail, Sand, Burn, Poison or...wait for it...Life orb! Alakazam already has an amazing special attack but back it up with Life orb without the self-damage, you will be getting KO's left and right.Tentacool/Tentacruel - Rain Dish - Sparkling Sea: Tentacruel is quite the defensive pokemon, and in the rain he will heal off what damage he will be taking. MUCH better than Liquid ooze ever will be.Slowpoke/Slowbro/Slowking - Regenerator - Sparkling Sea/Dream Radar: Slowbro/king are VERY defensive. Being able to set up a trick room throw a few attacks out, and switch to get some auto healing is amazing. Hands down his best ability.Magnemite/Magneton/Magnezone - Analytic - Rugged Mountain: Since these guys are so slow, you are almost guaranteed to get the Analytic boost. Backed by its high special attack and defense you are sure to make use of it.Grimer/Muk - Poison Touch - Dream Park/Hidden Grotto: ...It is better than it's other abilities. Never really played with it. Maybe I shouldDrowzee/Hypno - Inner Focus - Spooky Manor: Being able to throw a Hypnosis without fear of taking a Fake out is great. The best ability for this pokemon.Voltorb/Electrode - Aftermath - Icy Cave: This is a toss up between Static and this. Both are very sub par but that is what they get.Exeggcute/Exeggutor - Harvest - Pleasant Forest: Harvest has a 50% chance of bringing back a used berry every turn, or 100% guaranteed while the sun is out. Sitrus? Type resist berry? Get them back with Harvest.Lickitung/Lickilicky - Cloud Nine - Pleasant Forest: Being able to put a stop the the Rain, Sun, and Sand teams people use quite commonly is a great niche in the game. And being the best pokemon to use Explosion is always nice.Tangella/Tangrowth Regenerator - Pleasant Forest: See Slowpoke, but with Giga drain and other healing moves also.Kangaskhan - Inner Focus - Pleasant Forest: See Meowth/Persian.Goldeen/Seaking - Lightningrod - Sparkling Sea: See PikachuPinsir - Moxie - Dream Park/Hidden Grotto: Best ability for it. Gives +1 attack for each KO it gets.Gyarados - Moxie - Sparkling Sea: See PinsirLapras - Hydration - Sparkling Sea: Heals status conditions in the rain. So you have free use of Rest EVERY turn. Being as defensive as it is, this is an amazing ability for her.Ditto - Imposter - Hidden Grotto: Instant use of Transform without needing the attack. Need I say more?Eevee-evolutions - multiple uses for multiple pokemon. I may update this later.Aerodactyl - Unnerve - Windswept Sky: See Ekans/Arbok.Dragonite - Multiscale - Sparkling Sea/Hidden Grotto: When at full HP the damage you take is halved. This with Roost makes him quite the tank.That is it for now. I may do the rest later."
2012-11-29T08:50:41-0800,"Holy wall of text Batman!Does Harvest bring back a berry used more than one turn ago, or is it a one-time 50% or 100% chance to return the berry, and then more chance if the berry is brought back?Lightning Rod on Seaking is funny!Imposter on Ditto is amazing!"
2012-11-29T11:23:35-0800,"Spearow/Fearow - Sniper - Windswept Sky: Fearow is actually a cool Poke with the introduction of Drill Run. And Keen Eye is one of the worst abilities ever, so Sniper is a major improvement.Sandshrew/Sandslash - Sand Rush - Icy Cave: Sand rush makes Sandslash mildly usable as an offesnive Pokemon, something its previously never been able to do better than somethign else. Still outclassed by Excadrill, but better than it has been.Doduo/Dodrio - Tangled Feet - Pleasent Forest: None of its other abilities are great, and Tangled Feet lets you use a Choice Banded Thrash (now 120 BP) without ever becoming confused, which makes use of its decent attack and good speed.Krabby/Kingler - Sheer Force - Sparkling Sea/Hidden Grotto: His other abilities dont really help, and Sheer Force is an amazing ability. Its not as suited to him as some Pokemon, but its better than nothing.Tyrogue/Hitmonlee - Vital Spirit/Unburden - Rugged Mountain: Not the best for Tyrogue, but Unburden, alongside Normal Gem and Fake Out make Hitmonlee a dangerously fast and powerful sweeper.Smoochum/Jynx - Hydration/Dry Skin - Spooky Manor: Giving Jynx an immunity to Water can easily give you a free turn to use Lovely Kiss, Substitute, Nasty Plot or just go ont he offensive, and the constant healing under Rain is also quite nice.Taurous - Sheer Force - Pleasent Forest: Sheer Force is really just too good. Every Pokemon appreciates it.Natu/Xatu - Magic Bounce - Pleasent Forest: Magic Bounce is the only reason to use Xatu. The number fo moves it makes completely useless is staggering.Wooper/Quagsire - Unburden - Sparkling Sea: make Quagsire an excellent wall with Curse and Recover.Murkrow/Honchkrow - Prankster/Moxie - Windswept Sky/Hidden Grotto: Both abilities that perfectly compliment what the Pokemon can do, better than any other ability they have access to.Gligar/Gliscor - Immunity/Poison Heal - Windswept Sky/Hidden Grotto: Again, both Pokemon get abilities that allow them to function best at what they are meant to do.Qwilfish - Intimidate - Skarling Sea: Makes better use of his decent typing to wall fighting types and fire types in long enough to set up some hazards.HERACROSS -Moxie - Hidden Grotto/Dream Park: If you have a Heracross and it's not a MoxieCross, it should probably be a MoxieCross.Swinub/Piloswine/Mamoswine - Thick Fat - Icy Cave: An extra resistance and cancelation of a weakness with Mamo's handful of usable moves still available is too good to pass up.Girafarig/Stantler/Miltank - Sap Sipper - Pleasent Forest: None of these Pokemon mind Sap Sipper, all can use it decently, but its not the clear cut ability on any of them either.Poochyena/Mightyenna - Rattled/Moxie - Pleasent Forest: Poochyenna doesn't really care what ability he has, but Mightyenna can start to function as a halfway decent Pokemon with Sucker Punch/Crunch and Moxie in its arsenal.Wingull/Pelipper - Rain Dish - Windswept Sky: Keen Eye is bad, Rain Dish is ok. Keen Eye is really, really bad.Gallade - Justified -Spooky Manor/Nimbasa City (BLW2): You have to get a Ralts to get it, but Ralts' ability is worse than its usual ones. Justified however gives Gallade a way to raise his attack, which is usually better than Steadfast.Shroomish/BREELOOM - Quick Feet/Technician -Dream Park/Hidden Grotto: Quick Feet is cute and alright but TechLoom is a monster. Mach Punch/Low Sweep/Bullet Seed/Spore or Stone Edge. that's all you'll ever need.Sableye - Prankster - Spooky Manor/Nimbasa (BW2) : Sableye has a rediculous number of options to go alongside Prankster, that can easily shut down physically offesnive or set up Pokemon.Volbeat/Illumise - Prankster - Spooky Manor: Really this is Volbeat's blessing with Tail Glow/Baton pass, but Illumise doesnt have much else going for it.Carvanha/Sharpedo - Speed Boost - Sparkling Sea: Gotta go fastSpinda - Contrary - Rugged Mountain/Nimbasa (BW2): Super Power Contrary Spinda is fun, and more usable than anything else it could ever do.Cacnea/Cacturne - Water Absorb - Rugged Mountain: If you aren't using Sand, or are playign in a metagame where Sand Veil is banned, this is the best ability for it.Swablu/Altaria - Cloud Nine - Windswept Sky/Hidden Grotto: An equally good ability as Natural Cure. Shutting down weather is better in doubles, Nautral Cure is better in singles, but both are worth noting.Zangoose - Toxic Boost - Hidden Grotto/Dream Park: A signature dream world ability is pretty cool, and this works better on Zangoose than Immunity in every way, so why not?Barboach/Wishcash - Hydration - Sparkling Sea; I have used this thign in competitve battling where no one took it seriously and swept teams 6-0 with this guy. Rest/DD/Earthwuake/Waterfall in the rain can do so much damage it isnt even funny. And there is just something gratifying about using a Wishcash when you beat someoneCorpish/Crawdaunt - Adaptability - Sparkling Sea: Crawdaunt is the only Adaptability Poke with two typings, making it dangerous already. Add in Dragon Dance and you can have an amazingly proficeiant sweeper. If only it got Aqua Jet :/Lileep/Cradily - Storm Drain - Sparkling Sea: Lots of sea critters with great DW abilities. Storm Drain turns a neuatral hit into a healing immunity, which allows Cradily to set up Stockpiles easier.Anorith/Armaldo - Swift Swim - Sparkling Sea: Seriously, so much Sparklign sea in a row o.o Swift Swim is decent on these pokes, but they just aren't good Pokemon inof themselves.Tropius - Harvest - Windswept Sky: Worse than the Eggs at using it, but better than non-Harvest Tropius.Froslass - Cursed Body - Icy Cave: I'm not touching on any Pokemon with Moody because its a broken ability banned in every metagame i'll ever play, so ignore Snowrunt. But Cursed Body cna allow this Pokemon to set up Spikes and Destiny Bonds easier.Bagon/Shelgon/SALAMENCE - Sheer Force/Overcoat/Moxie - Rugged Mountain/Hidden Grotto: Moxiemence is the big claim to fame here, but the others don't hate their abilities either. But seriously. Moxiemence. Moxie is one of those abiltiies that blesses every Pokemon it touches. And Salamence is the peak of the Moxie Mountain.Staravia/Staraptor - Reckless - Windswept Sky: Added damage to its two best STAB moves make it an even more dangerous Pokemon.Shinx/Luxio/Luxray - Guts - Pleasent Forest: Awful Pokemon, but it reallyonly has two sets you could ever hope to use, and Guts is one fo them.Mothim - Tinted Lens - Pokemon Cafe Forest/Rugged Mountain: Bad Pokemon, its prevos don't want their DW abilities, but this one is slightly better than Swarm.Combee/Vespiquen - Hustle/Unerve - Hidden Grotto/Dream Park: Bad Pokemon, but both of them enjoy their DW ability. Vespiquen's regular ability isnt unusable though, some sets will prefer Pressure, but shutting off Lum Berry helps it Toxic Stall, which is all it does.Pachirisu - Volt Absorb - Pleasent Forest/Hidden Grotto: Its other abilities both do literally nothing, so anythign is an improvement.Buizel/Floatzel - Water Veil - Sparkling Sea: They can run either ability, but Switcherro/Flame Orb/Water Veil is a very cool niche this Pokemon has.Drifloon/Drifblim - Flare Boost - Windwept Sky: Getting the other half of Zangoose's ability, these Pokemon have 3 abilities that are all useful, and all for vary different roles.Gible/Gabite/Garchomp- Rough Skin - Icy Cave: Not sure why Gible would hang out near Ice, but Rough Skin is a decent ability, especially when playign where Sand Veil is banned.Herdier/Stoutland - Scrappy - Hidden Grotto: Sand Rush is usually better, but if you arent using Sand, being able to nail Ghosts with STAB Return frees you up from needing Crunch, and makes Choiced Sets better.Purrloin/Liepard - Prankster - Hidden Grotto: Swagger/Sub/Foul Play is a fun set. No Pokemon really dislikes Prankster as an ability, but this is not one of the better users of it.Pidove/Tranquil/Unfezant - Rivalry - Windswept Sky: None of its abilities are good, but this is a usable option.Blitzle/Zebstrika - Sap Sipper - Hidden Grotto: All their abilities are immunity abilities, so you can tailor it to whatever you want. Nice that it can't be Spored i suppose.Woobat/Swoobat - Simple - Hidden Grotto: Awww yeah. Simple Calm Mind for days. Great ability.Tympole/Palpitoad/Siesmetoad - Water Absorb - Pleasent Forest: Immunity abilities on common types are good, and quite standard on Water/Ground types. It works better than most of his abilities in most cases.Maractus - Storm Drain - Rugged Mountain: Better than Water Asborb, even though it does about the same thing.Trubbish/Garbodor - Aftermath - Hidden Grotto: More useful in most cases as he sets up hazards.Mincinno/CINCCINO - Skill Link - Hidden Grotto: Yes on all accounts. This is the only way to use this Pokemon, and it packs such a punch. Three different moves that will hit 5 times guaranteed providing decent coverage on non Steel types, with Wake Up Slap or U-turn as good 4th moves for that.Ducklett/Swanna - Hydration - Windswept Sky: Better thant he other two abilities, and Swanna really wants Rain support for its dual STABs.Emolga - Motor Drive - Windswept Sky: Emolga is frail, so anything that lets it not take a hit is good.Foongus/AMOONGUS - Regenerator - Hidden Grotto: Big big winner. Regenerator Amoongus replaces all other Amoongus. Not even outclasses, replaces. You use it with Regenerator, or you don't use it. Period.Alomomola - Regenerator - Sparkling Sea: Not as good a Regenerator as Amoongus, but not a bad addition.Klang/Klinklang - Clear Body - Icy Cave: Plus and Minus are horrible, even in doubles, since KK likes physical attacks better. The only ability it can use, and its not bad for the Pokemon.Elegym/Beheeym - Analytic - Spooky Manor: Slow Pokemon anyway, Synchornise is alright, but usualy Analytic will be superior.Cubchoo/Beartic - Rattled/Swift Swim - Hidden Grotto: Snow Cloak is just bad (and sometimes banned) so these abilities make more sense, though neither are that good on the Pokemon.Gollet/Golurk - No Guard - Spooky Manor: Usable, though i tend to lean towards Iron Fist.Also, Dugtrio with Sand Force is absolutely horrible. It should never run an ability that isn't Arena Trap. Ever. Arena Trap is what makes it good, so i'd hope that gets removed.I don't know if we are including Event/Promotional DW Abiltiies here, since they aren't as easy to access and i don't know about their releases in America. If we are, Blazekin, Infernape, Gothitelle, Venusaur, Charizard, Blastoise, Torterra and the elemental Monkeys all would garner attention on this list."
2012-11-29T12:55:07-0800,"More love for the Icy Cave pls. ^^Sneasel/Weavile - Pickpocket - Definitely better than Pressure on a speed Pokémon - can be useful with Focus Sash.Vanillite/Vanillish/Vanilluxe - Weak Armor - Can be useful for a faster second hit, while Ice Body only makes sense in Hail.Axew/Haxorus - Unnerve - See Ekans/Arbok, more useful than its other abilities."
2012-11-29T16:32:40-0800,"I wish, but no. Weavile has to be holding NOTHING for Pickpocket to work. Use with a berry if you want, but Focus Sash isn't going to work."
2012-11-29T23:06:24-0800,"Also, Haxorus should never be using Unerve. It is not more useful than Mold Breaker getting around Levitiate and Sturdy."
2012-11-30T10:06:45-0800,Lightningrod Seaking is amazing! Rids it of the electric weakness AND boost Sp.Atk.
2012-11-30T15:49:55-0800,But it's funny! Some fish hoping to be zapped swimming around in water.

2012-11-27T17:13:34-0800,"Hey there, I got the idea for this thread after reading the recent editorial post on pokebeach. I've actually been thinking along the same lines for a while now. Well, perhaps pokemon has seemed to rush this generation out the door. To be honest, I'm not that sure I mind ... overly. There were very few cute pokemon in this last batch in my opinion. Yes, I do like the latest set of games - Black and White 2, in fact in my opinion they are the best pokemon games produced so far. However there are (again, in my opinion) some things missing which would really set these games off. Use of the new 3DS system would make some great changes to the brand, bringing the ability to streamline some online playability. That'll certainly help, but what kinds of changes would you like to see in the games themselves?In my copy of Black 2 I've already put in almost 200 hours (I remember playing over 900 hours on Sapphire), yet I'm certainly not done fooling around with it. I'm sure many of you have even put way more hours than I have. I've only went through the pokemon league once, and that's unusual for me, since in other games I've went through it at least 50 times per game. I've only got 1 pokemon to level 100, and 3 in their 90's when normally I have quite a few more. I've completed my Unova dex, though I haven't caught them all yet. However I'm not that far away - I think I only need about 70 or so (give or take) There's a lot more to do and see in this game,yet there's still something missing. I'd like the opportunity to see what cross species breeding would produce. Can you imagine some of the cool combos that could be produced? Currently there are (along with the 28 Unowns) a total of what ... 676 different pokemon, right? Sure, there are some species of pokemon that don't breed, but that would leave more than enough variety to a new generation of games - perhaps even more than current full size game consoles could handle. Even if they were to limit breeding to within egg groups the variety would be more than enough to satisfy anyone's interest in new pokemon. The new abilities, stats, and interesting and cool new looks, I'd certainly have a hard time putting it down. And hey if you consider Spinda, maybe even varieties of looks within varieties! Personally I think that would be cool.So do you agree? Would you like to see that type of game ... or what would you like to see in a new ""generation"" of pokemon games?"
2012-11-27T17:23:57-0800,"I like the idea of cross breeding but not for looks. When I get my degree in game design I do plan on making a Pokemon game. The breeding system for that is going to allow you to breed for abilities, attacks and stat rank as well as a bunch of other cool stuff. All legendaries are going to be breed-able as well. Articunos can learn Thunderbolt through breading generation with a Pokemon like Zapdos.It will be a lot of work but its more fun training them."
2012-11-27T18:12:41-0800,"Personaly, i'd like a storyline that makes sense for the main character to become part of the conflict. My biggest problems with these evil teams they create isn't the repition of it, or the increasingly crazy dedication of members, designs or motives (Team Aqua... just no). It's that they have to get more and more blatant that these are events happening around your character that NPCs force you into.Looking at Pokemon Gold and Silver for instance, can you imagine how much more sense it would make for you to play as Silver? Your dad is the rocket boss, and you wouldn't need anything more than a diary or a small speech about not wanting to live in your fathers shadow. The gym challenge would be as arbitrary as usual, but at least the interaction with Team Rocket would make more sense.Or for Pokemon Black and White 2, playing as N. You are determined to right the wrongs you brought about and defeat the new wave of Team Plasma who stand for their own selfish desires. He already shows up at the big boss fight anyway for crying out loud!I do feel B/W2 certainly introduced some welcome changes with starting in a big city, the new locations Pokedex feature and such. It feels like they are really perfecting the mechanics. I just want to see the story arch of the game work in a bit more with the main characters. I had a hard time forcing myself through the newest games at time because everything was grinding and fetch quests, which brings me tot he second thing i'd reaaaaally liek to see.Adventure game style mini games. They've tried gimmicky minor plot battle systems like PokeWood, Musicals, the Frontier, Battle Tower and Contests, and none have really stuck. I want to see areas you enter where you have to do things where you get a bit more control. Like for instance, a Bug Catching contest where you get a first person view and have to scramble to get to the best Pokemon, racing against the other contestants. Like a mix of the Pokeatholon and Bug Catching contest ideas, but with a perspective change to mix things up. Or make the use of HM moves more interactive, by actually letting you surf, fly or have to hack away at trees.Now obviously some of this may be a bit much to ask for on the DS, and even the 3DS. But (and here comes what would really be the thing to make this the title of all titles. I want a game a main series game that is available to be played on the WiiU, the WiiU pad AND the 3DS. Pokemon is one of the biggest sellers for Nintendo and its time they really pushed a new title on some of these systems. Mario has been horribely abused with its consol transitions, almost alwasy beign remakes (though Paper Mario 2 looks cool) and i think that the increased power of these system needs to be put to use. It may be too much to ask that one game can be accesed on different platforms, but if not that than a savings/bundle package that allows you to play a 3DS version and a WiiU version in the least.The WiiPad makes a lot of sense for the lower screen of DS Pokemon games, which will allow for them to keep some of the charm while increasing graphics and making the usability as something as simple as the Bag pretty cool. It also has a lot of potential for reshaping the way battles are preformed. They do still have to recognie thata full out WiiU version will alienate long time fans of the portable version, and takes away some of the convience, so in some way or another, you have to have the game on both if you want it ont he WiiU, but with all the work it would take, i think they could get away with maing a new story in exsisting regions.And ofcourse, i want a Pokemon Snap 2 for the WiiU. it makes so much sense, and the fact is they could include ti in the main series game and just give your character a Camera. It would be soooooo cool darnit!"
2012-11-27T18:31:51-0800,"Ah, good, then I'm not the only one who's thought of it. I'm sure for long time players like you and I, Vaporeon, that might even tide us over, especially if we play the game competitvely as well, but I'd like to go for the gusto and also breed for the new and odd looks of new cross breeds as well. I don't think I'd ever get tired of checking out new formes though ... if given the chance. Anyone else have some other ideas of what they'd like to see in future new generation games?Edit: Shino, you've got some great ideas too. Actually having to work at hacking away at trees. Racing against other contestants, pokemon snap, yeah, definitely! Maybe even show levels of attacks - like how much more powerful an attack is by a pokemon at level 50 than at level 10."
2012-11-27T21:28:48-0800,"The problem with crossbreeding is it gets way out of hand, fast. Take the Field egg group, for example. If I'm counting right there are 90 Pokemon lines in this group, and Ditto makes 91. If each line has an effect on the Pokemon (for instance, breeding with Spoink gives a pearl on the head), then there would be over 4,000 combinations of lines possible. EACH of these would have to have a custom front and back sprite, fully animated, for each member of the evolutionary line.And oh yeah, we can't forget about shininess. So each and every one of those 4000+ combinations has to have TWO sets of sprites, one normal and one shiny.But wait, what about gender differences? Those with gender variants would need FOUR sets of sprites, (Male normal, male shiny, female normal, female shiny.)And that's only one egg group.It's been a while since I took a Statistics class, so I won't go though the effort of calculating everything out. Suffice to say that the entire cartridge would be stuffed full of sprites, and there would be NO room for, y'know, the game. Not saying it wouldn't be fun to see, but logistically it's a nightmare. Maybe in Gen 1 it would have been possible, but with so many Pokemon there's just no way."
2012-11-28T05:01:07-0800,"Yes, I'm sure logistically it might be challenging, but from what I understand, the 3DS is still working from cartridges, right? What's to stop them from making a larger cartridge? What's the current memory storage of one of those carts anyway? I certainly don't have any idea, but maybe some of you do. Over time, the memory capabilities get better anyway, so cross breeding would showcase the best possible use for it in my opinion.If something like that was attempted, I think it could even be marketed as a pokemon breeder's game to dumb down the plot a bit, concentrating upon the cross breeding aspect. And if even more in the future games (as in the next generation after this one) don't have the memory to keep all those sprites if someone was to port over a pokemon that didn't currently have a sprite in it's memory, couldn't the game just receive the sprite data from when the pokemon was transferred into the new game? And for that matter, can't a game be made where the sprite data is made up on the occasion of the production of the pokemon based on the original raw data of the current 676? Or how about breaking it into sections - gen 1 pokemon only crossbreeding/ gen 2 on another game/ gen 3 on another etc. Breaking it up would bring even further money to pokemon creators since there are so many of us who wanna ketchum all. I'm sure there are ways you can get around any of those objections. A little ingenuity and an active imagination would be all it takes. Oh, and years worth of man-hours of programming as well, lol."
2012-11-28T05:32:38-0800,"@P_AMy idea iis to make this Pokemon game in a way I was raised or grew up on and that take your favorite monster, train them to the best they can be and push them past that limit and become a part of their lives. Have them put their trust in you and you place your trust back into them. A true partnership and their will be many events in the game that reflect that.I was planning on giving your attacks a 'level'. A level 10 surf is a lot better then a level 1 surf. Your pokemon would gain AP which you would spend on upgrading attacks and abilities. I also plain to do way with the level system as its far too restrictive. It its place I will have a system where Pokemon have no stat cap. This way players can train and use their favorite Pokemon. Every Pokemon will give off EVs and AP in place of experience points. You can get a lot of EV's, like 5000 in a battle but you spend them to increase your stats. You'll go into a menu to use those points. Once you put the required amount of EV into a stat, that stat will increase by 1 point or x+ depending on that Pokemons stat rank.As for the breeding side of things. Physical changes would be hard for the design team but I'm sure color changes could be put in, Like a Vaporeon with white ear fins over yellow ones. I plan to make every pokemon breed able and will give every pokemon gender differences. A male and female form of Zapdos. I do have a lot planned for this game."
2012-11-28T09:51:55-0800,"Yeah, that's another point I like. Currently the games are somewhat restrictive on what you can buy. Sure, there are shops in BW2 that allow you to buy ""attacks"" by bringing a number of blue/green/red/yellow shards, but it has no corelation to how good a player/breeder/collector you are. It has everything to do with how lucky you are to happen upon the right shard lying around. If there was an ability to show off how good you are by earning the right to receive certain attacks and abilities that would be cool. Good idea Vaporeon. I also like the unlimited stat idea. It would definitely showcase your talent.Another thing that was showcased in another game was berries. Maybe I'm a bit of a farmer at heart, I don't know, perhaps that's why the breeding thing seemed to hit me. I would like the idea of growing and producing berries as well. Not just the available ones, but showcase your talent with growing.

2012-11-28T11:40:58-0800,"OOOooo great ideas! Right on, I like it. Gives more reason to utilize online content, and showcases abilities as well.Hey, how about this: The ability to import your own music! The 3DS has a slot for a micro SD card, right?

You could also make the game a bit more realistic by showing how long it takes to make a particular attack. Like Quick Attack or Extreme Speed would be almost instantaneous, whereas maybe it takes 5 seconds to do surf (the time it takes to build a big wave), and make the attacks land when they land, instead of being turn based. Then if you have enough time to get in another shot at an opponent's pokemon (before they faint yours), then you can take a shot at a second attack. Sometimes you may even get in 3 or 4 shots before a pokemon is able to get one attack off. An option to turn off turn based attacking would be great. Sometimes you'd like to crush a pokemon fast, and sometimes the speed of your own pokemon might be slower so you might want to reinstate turn based play. Just a thought."

They can jump, run, walk, dash, block, fly if they can fly, etc. I want to do it this way so the game does not focus much on speed. While the game will focus on stats, it wont be as dependent on them like the DS games now and will force players to play using their favorite Pokemon... like how the game should be and not just use what wins or has the highest stats.I was also going to change how stat buffers work as well. You can only boost a stat once but the effect will only stay in play for about 20 or so seconds they it will go away. Status effects like sleep will go away if the Pokemon is hit. So nothing in the game will be based on turns but time. The battle system is what I really want to get done. I plan on this game being the way Pokemon should be.If its also possible, I want to release 2 versions of the game.

Do realize the online features will not take away for basic game play."
2012-11-28T18:55:18-0800,"Since you've mentioned you want to be a game designer, I'd like to highlight this statement you've made briefly, because it disturbs me as another hopeful game designer.""X is popular"" is not a good reason to do something. In fact, it is one of the worst possible reasons to do something, taken alone. In marketing it seems all too common for campaigns to be structured around an idea that is ""popular"" without really paying attention to why, and such campaigns fail. It's important to really examine what you gain from something before implementing it. Something being ""popular"" should only give you the idea. It doesn't mean you should do it.In this case, an online store for Pokemon makes so little sense to me. What would you sell there - or make to sell there - that would be better than what you can already get through the Pokemart? Game Freak seems to know exactly how much they want you to work to get their items: see the Battle Frontier. They could make some kind of an online store to make getting TMs, EV items, and the like, but I don't know what they would put there that would be unique and useful without somehow breaking the game for anyone that couldn't or didn't want to use the store.There is a big difference between downloadablelike regions, missions, Pokemon, and the like - and an online store that contains items that a player might want or need to proceed. Have you ever played a mock-free MMO like Grand Fantasia or Runescape or something like that? Technically the game is free to play, but it becomes so obnoxiously difficult to play without paying for membership or some other service that you feel like you aren't getting the 'real experience' without paying for it. Even if other players can just pay for nice outfits, cool cosmetic weapons, or other features, it can actually put off some other players that really like your game just as a free experience (with whatever ad revenue or hard cartridge sales you would get anyway). It was always frustrating to see people running around with awesome outfits/wings/pets/skins/etc that I couldn't get because I wasn't willing to pay for them, but know that I had no way to 'earn' them through gameplay.This is also kind of a faulty point of view. Technically speaking you're right - ADDING an online feature doesn't detract from what's already in the hard copy of the game. But especially in a competitive/community game like Pokemon, you really lose out if you miss the online features. If you don't have an opportunity to attend Nintendo giveaways or trade with people who do, you can't complete the Pokedex no matter how hard you try, for example. There will always be Pokemon that other people can get, but you can't. This is an obnoxious feeling for any player and will drive them away from the game.As a developer you have to decide how interested you are in the faction that can't use the content you're making. Maybe you don't care that much, and that's fine, but trying to say ""It won't take away from the basic game, so you shouldn't complain!"" strikes me as a failure to acknowledge the way an audience actually reacts to game content."
2012-11-28T19:01:56-0800,"I sort of like the idea of a game that is a ""team work "" stratagy based where you need to ""switch"" off to another Pokemon to get in the attack to take down the Boss Pokemon.Example:Party Pokemon:CharizardPidgeotScytherNidokingPikachuSandslashBoss:KyogreYou will travel around like a First person shooter game, carrying your 5 Pokemon while one stays out and follows you. You will need to travel to various areas of the game, go through tunnles, caves, hills- ect... visit towns- But the goal of the game would be to go capture all of the Legendary Pokemon.You will be restricted to the 6 Pokemon, and youll need to trade off Pokemon with people in the game in order to go into other areas of the game. Like, if you want to go into the hills, you will need to trade in a Pokemon for 1 of 10 choice Pokemon to take along to navigate an area. Pokemon will level up and battle as normal.You will not be able to catch wild Pokemon. Part of the stratagy is to plan ahead to make a team to go take on a legend Boss Pokemon.Youll fight say, Kyogre at a lake in the plains area, Groudon in a cave, ect.The battle mechanics will be way different, as you will need to utilize all 6 in the battle against a Boss.You will approach the Boss, and all of your Pokemon will come out. You will need to place the Pokemon in a strategic manner around the Boss, and co-op the attacks to get it to where only a specific attack will actually bring down the Boss Pokemon's health.Example battle:Said above team to take on KyogreUse Charizard to pick up Pikachu and land Pikachu up onto a ledge to be able to use Thunderbolt targeted at Kyogre to get in the hit needed to reduce the hit points on Kyogre.Meanwhile Kyogre is attacking all over the place, say with water gun, hitting your other Pokemon and reducing thier hit points to KO your team.Sandslash is digging holes to lower the water level, so Kyogre will move around alot less, making it easier for Pikachu to target in with the Thunder bolt. Kyogre's weak spot is on it's belly, so you will need Nidoking to aproach Kyogre to give it a Tail slam to get Kyogre to flip over to expose the week spot.The way to switch to a different Pokemon during the battle will be like a ""control teleport first person view"" from the ""eyes"" of the Pokemon you go to switch to in order to control and move the Pokemon to do the task, like actually fly Charizard to pick Up Pikachu, and then Switch to another Pokemon to do the task such as Draining the water down to immobilize Kyogre.Kyogre won't be a simple push over either. He will have like Surf, to flood an area and Rain dance to raise the water level back up. Ice beam to build up a wall of ice to block your attacks.This is just a game idea I have had for a loooooooooooonnnnnngggggg time. I do think that it would be awesome to have a battle style like this. And, after you KO the Boss, you do get to catch it and transfer it to your DS game.Anyways, I hope what I said made sence. It would take a good amount of stratagy, planning, choosing the right Pokemon, having them to need to level up a little to go fight the next tougher Boss-meh- only a dream game..................."
2012-11-28T19:18:22-0800,I'd be happy if they included a halfway decent story and finally ditched the 2x2 square grids. I'm a simple guy in that way.
2012-11-28T19:54:15-0800,"@ KayleWell I do care about everyone who plays the game but not every will have access to all the games features but they are there for those who can use them. They wont take away from the main story of the game. As for what items would be DLC, I dont know yet. Still working on details for that.@ BulladosThe story will be great. You'll be playing as a trainer that got accepted into the Pokemon Guardian Force. its a military force. Collecting Gym badges and the E4 are optional and you will not be restricted to square grids."
2012-11-27T17:13:34-0800,"Hey there, I got the idea for this thread after reading the recent editorial post on pokebeach. I've actually been thinking along the same lines for a while now. Well, perhaps pokemon has seemed to rush this generation out the door. To be honest, I'm not that sure I mind ... overly. There were very few cute pokemon in this last batch in my opinion. Yes, I do like the latest set of games - Black and White 2, in fact in my opinion they are the best pokemon games produced so far. However there are (again, in my opinion) some things missing which would really set these games off. Use of the new 3DS system would make some great changes to the brand, bringing the ability to streamline some online playability. That'll certainly help, but what kinds of changes would you like to see in the games themselves?In my copy of Black 2 I've already put in almost 200 hours (I remember playing over 900 hours on Sapphire), yet I'm certainly not done fooling around with it. I'm sure many of you have even put way more hours than I have. I've only went through the pokemon league once, and that's unusual for me, since in other games I've went through it at least 50 times per game. I've only got 1 pokemon to level 100, and 3 in their 90's when normally I have quite a few more. I've completed my Unova dex, though I haven't caught them all yet. However I'm not that far away - I think I only need about 70 or so (give or take) There's a lot more to do and see in this game,yet there's still something missing. I'd like the opportunity to see what cross species breeding would produce. Can you imagine some of the cool combos that could be produced? Currently there are (along with the 28 Unowns) a total of what ... 676 different pokemon, right? Sure, there are some species of pokemon that don't breed, but that would leave more than enough variety to a new generation of games - perhaps even more than current full size game consoles could handle. Even if they were to limit breeding to within egg groups the variety would be more than enough to satisfy anyone's interest in new pokemon. The new abilities, stats, and interesting and cool new looks, I'd certainly have a hard time putting it down. And hey if you consider Spinda, maybe even varieties of looks within varieties! Personally I think that would be cool.So do you agree? Would you like to see that type of game ... or what would you like to see in a new ""generation"" of pokemon games?"
2012-11-27T17:23:57-0800,"I like the idea of cross breeding but not for looks. When I get my degree in game design I do plan on making a Pokemon game. The breeding system for that is going to allow you to breed for abilities, attacks and stat rank as well as a bunch of other cool stuff. All legendaries are going to be breed-able as well. Articunos can learn Thunderbolt through breading generation with a Pokemon like Zapdos.It will be a lot of work but its more fun training them."
2012-11-27T18:12:41-0800,"Personaly, i'd like a storyline that makes sense for the main character to become part of the conflict. My biggest problems with these evil teams they create isn't the repition of it, or the increasingly crazy dedication of members, designs or motives (Team Aqua... just no). It's that they have to get more and more blatant that these are events happening around your character that NPCs force you into.Looking at Pokemon Gold and Silver for instance, can you imagine how much more sense it would make for you to play as Silver? Your dad is the rocket boss, and you wouldn't need anything more than a diary or a small speech about not wanting to live in your fathers shadow. The gym challenge would be as arbitrary as usual, but at least the interaction with Team Rocket would make more sense.Or for Pokemon Black and White 2, playing as N. You are determined to right the wrongs you brought about and defeat the new wave of Team Plasma who stand for their own selfish desires. He already shows up at the big boss fight anyway for crying out loud!I do feel B/W2 certainly introduced some welcome changes with starting in a big city, the new locations Pokedex feature and such. It feels like they are really perfecting the mechanics. I just want to see the story arch of the game work in a bit more with the main characters. I had a hard time forcing myself through the newest games at time because everything was grinding and fetch quests, which brings me tot he second thing i'd reaaaaally liek to see.Adventure game style mini games. They've tried gimmicky minor plot battle systems like PokeWood, Musicals, the Frontier, Battle Tower and Contests, and none have really stuck. I want to see areas you enter where you have to do things where you get a bit more control. Like for instance, a Bug Catching contest where you get a first person view and have to scramble to get to the best Pokemon, racing against the other contestants. Like a mix of the Pokeatholon and Bug Catching contest ideas, but with a perspective change to mix things up. Or make the use of HM moves more interactive, by actually letting you surf, fly or have to hack away at trees.Now obviously some of this may be a bit much to ask for on the DS, and even the 3DS. But (and here comes what would really be the thing to make this the title of all titles. I want a game a main series game that is available to be played on the WiiU, the WiiU pad AND the 3DS. Pokemon is one of the biggest sellers for Nintendo and its time they really pushed a new title on some of these systems. Mario has been horribely abused with its consol transitions, almost alwasy beign remakes (though Paper Mario 2 looks cool) and i think that the increased power of these system needs to be put to use. It may be too much to ask that one game can be accesed on different platforms, but if not that than a savings/bundle package that allows you to play a 3DS version and a WiiU version in the least.The WiiPad makes a lot of sense for the lower screen of DS Pokemon games, which will allow for them to keep some of the charm while increasing graphics and making the usability as something as simple as the Bag pretty cool. It also has a lot of potential for reshaping the way battles are preformed. They do still have to recognie thata full out WiiU version will alienate long time fans of the portable version, and takes away some of the convience, so in some way or another, you have to have the game on both if you want it ont he WiiU, but with all the work it would take, i think they could get away with maing a new story in exsisting regions.And ofcourse, i want a Pokemon Snap 2 for the WiiU. it makes so much sense, and the fact is they could include ti in the main series game and just give your character a Camera. It would be soooooo cool darnit!"
2012-11-27T18:31:51-0800,"Ah, good, then I'm not the only one who's thought of it. I'm sure for long time players like you and I, Vaporeon, that might even tide us over, especially if we play the game competitvely as well, but I'd like to go for the gusto and also breed for the new and odd looks of new cross breeds as well. I don't think I'd ever get tired of checking out new formes though ... if given the chance. Anyone else have some other ideas of what they'd like to see in future new generation games?Edit: Shino, you've got some great ideas too. Actually having to work at hacking away at trees. Racing against other contestants, pokemon snap, yeah, definitely! Maybe even show levels of attacks - like how much more powerful an attack is by a pokemon at level 50 than at level 10."
2012-11-27T21:28:48-0800,"The problem with crossbreeding is it gets way out of hand, fast. Take the Field egg group, for example. If I'm counting right there are 90 Pokemon lines in this group, and Ditto makes 91. If each line has an effect on the Pokemon (for instance, breeding with Spoink gives a pearl on the head), then there would be over 4,000 combinations of lines possible. EACH of these would have to have a custom front and back sprite, fully animated, for each member of the evolutionary line.And oh yeah, we can't forget about shininess. So each and every one of those 4000+ combinations has to have TWO sets of sprites, one normal and one shiny.But wait, what about gender differences? Those with gender variants would need FOUR sets of sprites, (Male normal, male shiny, female normal, female shiny.)And that's only one egg group.It's been a while since I took a Statistics class, so I won't go though the effort of calculating everything out. Suffice to say that the entire cartridge would be stuffed full of sprites, and there would be NO room for, y'know, the game. Not saying it wouldn't be fun to see, but logistically it's a nightmare. Maybe in Gen 1 it would have been possible, but with so many Pokemon there's just no way."
2012-11-28T05:01:07-0800,"Yes, I'm sure logistically it might be challenging, but from what I understand, the 3DS is still working from cartridges, right? What's to stop them from making a larger cartridge? What's the current memory storage of one of those carts anyway? I certainly don't have any idea, but maybe some of you do. Over time, the memory capabilities get better anyway, so cross breeding would showcase the best possible use for it in my opinion.If something like that was attempted, I think it could even be marketed as a pokemon breeder's game to dumb down the plot a bit, concentrating upon the cross breeding aspect. And if even more in the future games (as in the next generation after this one) don't have the memory to keep all those sprites if someone was to port over a pokemon that didn't currently have a sprite in it's memory, couldn't the game just receive the sprite data from when the pokemon was transferred into the new game? And for that matter, can't a game be made where the sprite data is made up on the occasion of the production of the pokemon based on the original raw data of the current 676? Or how about breaking it into sections - gen 1 pokemon only crossbreeding/ gen 2 on another game/ gen 3 on another etc. Breaking it up would bring even further money to pokemon creators since there are so many of us who wanna ketchum all. I'm sure there are ways you can get around any of those objections. A little ingenuity and an active imagination would be all it takes. Oh, and years worth of man-hours of programming as well, lol."
2012-11-28T05:32:38-0800,"@P_AMy idea iis to make this Pokemon game in a way I was raised or grew up on and that take your favorite monster, train them to the best they can be and push them past that limit and become a part of their lives. Have them put their trust in you and you place your trust back into them. A true partnership and their will be many events in the game that reflect that.I was planning on giving your attacks a 'level'. A level 10 surf is a lot better then a level 1 surf. Your pokemon would gain AP which you would spend on upgrading attacks and abilities. I also plain to do way with the level system as its far too restrictive. It its place I will have a system where Pokemon have no stat cap. This way players can train and use their favorite Pokemon. Every Pokemon will give off EVs and AP in place of experience points. You can get a lot of EV's, like 5000 in a battle but you spend them to increase your stats. You'll go into a menu to use those points. Once you put the required amount of EV into a stat, that stat will increase by 1 point or x+ depending on that Pokemons stat rank.As for the breeding side of things. Physical changes would be hard for the design team but I'm sure color changes could be put in, Like a Vaporeon with white ear fins over yellow ones. I plan to make every pokemon breed able and will give every pokemon gender differences. A male and female form of Zapdos. I do have a lot planned for this game."
2012-11-28T09:51:55-0800,"Yeah, that's another point I like. Currently the games are somewhat restrictive on what you can buy. Sure, there are shops in BW2 that allow you to buy ""attacks"" by bringing a number of blue/green/red/yellow shards, but it has no corelation to how good a player/breeder/collector you are. It has everything to do with how lucky you are to happen upon the right shard lying around. If there was an ability to show off how good you are by earning the right to receive certain attacks and abilities that would be cool. Good idea Vaporeon. I also like the unlimited stat idea. It would definitely showcase your talent.Another thing that was showcased in another game was berries. Maybe I'm a bit of a farmer at heart, I don't know, perhaps that's why the breeding thing seemed to hit me. I would like the idea of growing and producing berries as well. Not just the available ones, but showcase your talent with growing. If you have the right mulch and take care of the plants as well as (or better than) your pokemon, then you could get a better crop of berries, perhaps multiple berries at a time .... or maybe more potent berries with added effects. This could result in a better sim game with many more options than the current generation."
2012-11-28T10:05:51-0800,"Oh another thing is the game will offer in game services through other players or you can buy items online from a store (more then likely the nintendo e shop) but Players can make items, poke balls, ect and you can put them on your online store and if players need to buy a item, they can go to the games online store (like a GTS but with all items players put up to sell) and buy the items.

Have you ever played a mock-free MMO like Grand Fantasia or Runescape or something like that? Technically the game is free to play, but it becomes so obnoxiously difficult to play without paying for membership or some other service that you feel like you aren't getting the 'real experience' without paying for it. Even if other players can just pay for nice outfits, cool cosmetic weapons, or other features, it can actually put off some other players that really like your game just as a free experience (with whatever ad revenue or hard cartridge sales you would get anyway). It was always frustrating to see people running around with awesome outfits/wings/pets/skins/etc that I couldn't get because I wasn't willing to pay for them, but know that I had no way to 'earn' them through gameplay.This is also kind of a faulty point of view. Technically speaking you're right - ADDING an online feature doesn't detract from what's already in the hard copy of the game. But especially in a competitive/community game like Pokemon, you really lose out if you miss the online features. If you don't have an opportunity to attend Nintendo giveaways or trade with people who do, you can't complete the Pokedex no matter how hard you try, for example. There will always be Pokemon that other people can get, but you can't. This is an obnoxious feeling for any player and will drive them away from the game.As a developer you have to decide how interested you are in the faction that can't use the content you're making. Maybe you don't care that much, and that's fine, but trying to say ""It won't take away from the basic game, so you shouldn't complain!"" strikes me as a failure to acknowledge the way an audience actually reacts to game content."
2012-11-28T19:01:56-0800,"I sort of like the idea of a game that is a ""team work "" stratagy based where you need to ""switch"" off to another Pokemon to get in the attack to take down the Boss Pokemon.Example:Party Pokemon:CharizardPidgeotScytherNidokingPikachuSandslashBoss:KyogreYou will travel around like a First person shooter game, carrying your 5 Pokemon while one stays out and follows you. You will need to travel to various areas of the game, go through tunnles, caves, hills- ect... visit towns- But the goal of the game would be to go capture all of the Legendary Pokemon.You will be restricted to the 6 Pokemon, and youll need to trade off Pokemon with people in the game in order to go into other areas of the game. Like, if you want to go into the hills, you will need to trade in a Pokemon for 1 of 10 choice Pokemon to take along to navigate an area. Pokemon will level up and battle as normal.You will not be able to catch wild Pokemon. Part of the stratagy is to plan ahead to make a team to go take on a legend Boss Pokemon.Youll fight say, Kyogre at a lake in the plains area, Groudon in a cave, ect.The battle mechanics will be way different, as you will need to utilize all 6 in the battle against a Boss.You will approach the Boss, and all of your Pokemon will come out.

Kyogre's weak spot is on it's belly, so you will need Nidoking to aproach Kyogre to give it a Tail slam to get Kyogre to flip over to expose the week spot.The way to switch to a different Pokemon during the battle will be like a ""control teleport first person view"" from the ""eyes"" of the Pokemon you go to switch to in order to control and move the Pokemon to do the task, like actually fly Charizard to pick Up Pikachu, and then Switch to another Pokemon to do the task such as Draining the water down to immobilize Kyogre.Kyogre won't be a simple push over either.

2012-11-28T19:18:22-0800,I'd be happy if they included a halfway decent story and finally ditched the 2x2 square grids. I'm a simple guy in that way.

2012-11-27T17:13:34-0800,"Hey there, I got the idea for this thread after reading the recent editorial post on pokebeach. I've actually been thinking along the same lines for a while now. Well, perhaps pokemon has seemed to rush this generation out the door. To be honest, I'm not that sure I mind ... overly. There were very few cute pokemon in this last batch in my opinion. Yes, I do like the latest set of games - Black and White 2, in fact in my opinion they are the best pokemon games produced so far. However there are (again, in my opinion) some things missing which would really set these games off. Use of the new 3DS system would make some great changes to the brand, bringing the ability to streamline some online playability. That'll certainly help, but what kinds of changes would you like to see in the games themselves?In my copy of Black 2 I've already put in almost 200 hours (I remember playing over 900 hours on Sapphire), yet I'm certainly not done fooling around with it. I'm sure many of you have even put way more hours than I have. I've only went through the pokemon league once, and that's unusual for me, since in other games I've went through it at least 50 times per game. I've only got 1 pokemon to level 100, and 3 in their 90's when normally I have quite a few more. I've completed my Unova dex, though I haven't caught them all yet. However I'm not that far away - I think I only need about 70 or so (give or take) There's a lot more to do and see in this game,yet there's still something missing. I'd like the opportunity to see what cross species breeding would produce. Can you imagine some of the cool combos that could be produced? Currently there are (along with the 28 Unowns) a total of what ... 676 different pokemon, right? Sure, there are some species of pokemon that don't breed, but that would leave more than enough variety to a new generation of games - perhaps even more than current full size game consoles could handle. Even if they were to limit breeding to within egg groups the variety would be more than enough to satisfy anyone's interest in new pokemon. The new abilities, stats, and interesting and cool new looks, I'd certainly have a hard time putting it down. And hey if you consider Spinda, maybe even varieties of looks within varieties! Personally I think that would be cool.So do you agree? Would you like to see that type of game ... or what would you like to see in a new ""generation"" of pokemon games?"
2012-11-27T17:23:57-0800,"I like the idea of cross breeding but not for looks. When I get my degree in game design I do plan on making a Pokemon game. The breeding system for that is going to allow you to breed for abilities, attacks and stat rank as well as a bunch of other cool stuff. All legendaries are going to be breed-able as well. Articunos can learn Thunderbolt through breading generation with a Pokemon like Zapdos.It will be a lot of work but its more fun training them."
2012-11-27T18:12:41-0800,"Personaly, i'd like a storyline that makes sense for the main character to become part of the conflict. My biggest problems with these evil teams they create isn't the repition of it, or the increasingly crazy dedication of members, designs or motives (Team Aqua... just no). It's that they have to get more and more blatant that these are events happening around your character that NPCs force you into.Looking at Pokemon Gold and Silver for instance, can you imagine how much more sense it would make for you to play as Silver? Your dad is the rocket boss, and you wouldn't need anything more than a diary or a small speech about not wanting to live in your fathers shadow. The gym challenge would be as arbitrary as usual, but at least the interaction with Team Rocket would make more sense.Or for Pokemon Black and White 2, playing as N. You are determined to right the wrongs you brought about and defeat the new wave of Team Plasma who stand for their own selfish desires. He already shows up at the big boss fight anyway for crying out loud!I do feel B/W2 certainly introduced some welcome changes with starting in a big city, the new locations Pokedex feature and such. It feels like they are really perfecting the mechanics. I just want to see the story arch of the game work in a bit more with the main characters. I had a hard time forcing myself through the newest games at time because everything was grinding and fetch quests, which brings me tot he second thing i'd reaaaaally liek to see.Adventure game style mini games. They've tried gimmicky minor plot battle systems like PokeWood, Musicals, the Frontier, Battle Tower and Contests, and none have really stuck. I want to see areas you enter where you have to do things where you get a bit more control. Like for instance, a Bug Catching contest where you get a first person view and have to scramble to get to the best Pokemon, racing against the other contestants. Like a mix of the Pokeatholon and Bug Catching contest ideas, but with a perspective change to mix things up. Or make the use of HM moves more interactive, by actually letting you surf, fly or have to hack away at trees.Now obviously some of this may be a bit much to ask for on the DS, and even the 3DS. But (and here comes what would really be the thing to make this the title of all titles. I want a game a main series game that is available to be played on the WiiU, the WiiU pad AND the 3DS. Pokemon is one of the biggest sellers for Nintendo and its time they really pushed a new title on some of these systems. Mario has been horribely abused with its consol transitions, almost alwasy beign remakes (though Paper Mario 2 looks cool) and i think that the increased power of these system needs to be put to use. It may be too much to ask that one game can be accesed on different platforms, but if not that than a savings/bundle package that allows you to play a 3DS version and a WiiU version in the least.The WiiPad makes a lot of sense for the lower screen of DS Pokemon games, which will allow for them to keep some of the charm while increasing graphics and making the usability as something as simple as the Bag pretty cool. It also has a lot of potential for reshaping the way battles are preformed. They do still have to recognie thata full out WiiU version will alienate long time fans of the portable version, and takes away some of the convience, so in some way or another, you have to have the game on both if you want it ont he WiiU, but with all the work it would take, i think they could get away with maing a new story in exsisting regions.And ofcourse, i want a Pokemon Snap 2 for the WiiU. it makes so much sense, and the fact is they could include ti in the main series game and just give your character a Camera. It would be soooooo cool darnit!"
2012-11-27T18:31:51-0800,"Ah, good, then I'm not the only one who's thought of it. I'm sure for long time players like you and I, Vaporeon, that might even tide us over, especially if we play the game competitvely as well, but I'd like to go for the gusto and also breed for the new and odd looks of new cross breeds as well. I don't think I'd ever get tired of checking out new formes though ... if given the chance. Anyone else have some other ideas of what they'd like to see in future new generation games?Edit: Shino, you've got some great ideas too. Actually having to work at hacking away at trees. Racing against other contestants, pokemon snap, yeah, definitely! Maybe even show levels of attacks - like how much more powerful an attack is by a pokemon at level 50 than at level 10."
2012-11-27T21:28:48-0800,"The problem with crossbreeding is it gets way out of hand, fast. Take the Field egg group, for example. If I'm counting right there are 90 Pokemon lines in this group, and Ditto makes 91. If each line has an effect on the Pokemon (for instance, breeding with Spoink gives a pearl on the head), then there would be over 4,000 combinations of lines possible. EACH of these would have to have a custom front and back sprite, fully animated, for each member of the evolutionary line.And oh yeah, we can't forget about shininess. So each and every one of those 4000+ combinations has to have TWO sets of sprites, one normal and one shiny.But wait, what about gender differences? Those with gender variants would need FOUR sets of sprites, (Male normal, male shiny, female normal, female shiny.)And that's only one egg group.It's been a while since I took a Statistics class, so I won't go though the effort of calculating everything out. Suffice to say that the entire cartridge would be stuffed full of sprites, and there would be NO room for, y'know, the game. Not saying it wouldn't be fun to see, but logistically it's a nightmare. Maybe in Gen 1 it would have been possible, but with so many Pokemon there's just no way."
2012-11-28T05:01:07-0800,"Yes, I'm sure logistically it might be challenging, but from what I understand, the 3DS is still working from cartridges, right? What's to stop them from making a larger cartridge? What's the current memory storage of one of those carts anyway? I certainly don't have any idea, but maybe some of you do. Over time, the memory capabilities get better anyway, so cross breeding would showcase the best possible use for it in my opinion.If something like that was attempted, I think it could even be marketed as a pokemon breeder's game to dumb down the plot a bit, concentrating upon the cross breeding aspect. And if even more in the future games (as in the next generation after this one) don't have the memory to keep all those sprites if someone was to port over a pokemon that didn't currently have a sprite in it's memory, couldn't the game just receive the sprite data from when the pokemon was transferred into the new game? And for that matter, can't a game be made where the sprite data is made up on the occasion of the production of the pokemon based on the original raw data of the current 676? Or how about breaking it into sections - gen 1 pokemon only crossbreeding/ gen 2 on another game/ gen 3 on another etc. Breaking it up would bring even further money to pokemon creators since there are so many of us who wanna ketchum all. I'm sure there are ways you can get around any of those objections. A little ingenuity and an active imagination would be all it takes. Oh, and years worth of man-hours of programming as well, lol."
2012-11-28T05:32:38-0800,"@P_AMy idea iis to make this Pokemon game in a way I was raised or grew up on and that take your favorite monster, train them to the best they can be and push them past that limit and become a part of their lives. Have them put their trust in you and you place your trust back into them. A true partnership and their will be many events in the game that reflect that.I was planning on giving your attacks a 'level'. A level 10 surf is a lot better then a level 1 surf. Your pokemon would gain AP which you would spend on upgrading attacks and abilities. I also plain to do way with the level system as its far too restrictive. It its place I will have a system where Pokemon have no stat cap. This way players can train and use their favorite Pokemon. Every Pokemon will give off EVs and AP in place of experience points. You can get a lot of EV's, like 5000 in a battle but you spend them to increase your stats. You'll go into a menu to use those points. Once you put the required amount of EV into a stat, that stat will increase by 1 point or x+ depending on that Pokemons stat rank.As for the breeding side of things. Physical changes would be hard for the design team but I'm sure color changes could be put in, Like a Vaporeon with white ear fins over yellow ones. I plan to make every pokemon breed able and will give every pokemon gender differences. A male and female form of Zapdos. I do have a lot planned for this game."
2012-11-28T09:51:55-0800,"Yeah, that's another point I like. Currently the games are somewhat restrictive on what you can buy. Sure, there are shops in BW2 that allow you to buy ""attacks"" by bringing a number of blue/green/red/yellow shards, but it has no corelation to how good a player/breeder/collector you are. It has everything to do with how lucky you are to happen upon the right shard lying around. If there was an ability to show off how good you are by earning the right to receive certain attacks and abilities that would be cool. Good idea Vaporeon. I also like the unlimited stat idea. It would definitely showcase your talent.Another thing that was showcased in another game was berries. Maybe I'm a bit of a farmer at heart, I don't know, perhaps that's why the breeding thing seemed to hit me. I would like the idea of growing and producing berries as well. Not just the available ones, but showcase your talent with growing. If you have the right mulch and take care of the plants as well as (or better than) your pokemon, then you could get a better crop of berries, perhaps multiple berries at a time .... or maybe more potent berries with added effects. This could result in a better sim game with many more options than the current generation."
2012-11-28T10:05:51-0800,"Oh another thing is the game will offer in game services through other players or you can buy items online from a store (more then likely the nintendo e shop) but Players can make items, poke balls, ect and you can put them on your online store and if players need to buy a item, they can go to the games online store (like a GTS but with all items players put up to sell) and buy the items. That will also be very unique because I'm going to make it to when you finish making a item, they will get a rank on how good they are. The better the rank, the more effective the item or the longer it will last through use (like battle items will break but the higher the rank, the longer it will last)The same thing will also apply to berries. You can breed custom effect into them during the growing process and when they are done, you can sell them to other players or use them yourself."
2012-11-28T11:40:58-0800,"OOOooo great ideas! Right on, I like it. Gives more reason to utilize online content, and showcases abilities as well.Hey, how about this: The ability to import your own music! The 3DS has a slot for a micro SD card, right? How about being able to access music you put on the card while you're using the game? I think that would be sooo cool. Rockin on to your own tunes would be much more preferred than boring pokemon music. Hey don't get me wrong, pokemon music is cool IN SMALL DOSES, but it kinda wears on ya after a while. Everyone has their own style, and it may not coincide with the supplied music. Personally I shut my speakers off while playing pokemon currently.Edit: One more suggestion. You could also make the game a bit more realistic by showing how long it takes to make a particular attack. Like Quick Attack or Extreme Speed would be almost instantaneous, whereas maybe it takes 5 seconds to do surf (the time it takes to build a big wave), and make the attacks land when they land, instead of being turn based. Then if you have enough time to get in another shot at an opponent's pokemon (before they faint yours), then you can take a shot at a second attack. Sometimes you may even get in 3 or 4 shots before a pokemon is able to get one attack off. An option to turn off turn based attacking would be great. Sometimes you'd like to crush a pokemon fast, and sometimes the speed of your own pokemon might be slower so you might want to reinstate turn based play. Just a thought."
2012-11-28T12:59:40-0800,"Well, this game would be maid for the Wii U or other future system with online option to play and do missions with friends. I'm sure allowing the use of your own music in game should not be too hard because most xbox 360 games allow it.As for the battle system, I was taking away the turn base system and replacing it with a free roam system so players can control their Pokemon in battle. They can jump, run, walk, dash, block, fly if they can fly, etc. I want to do it this way so the game does not focus much on speed. While the game will focus on stats, it wont be as dependent on them like the DS games now and will force players to play using their favorite Pokemon... like how the game should be and not just use what wins or has the highest stats.I was also going to change how stat buffers work as well. You can only boost a stat once but the effect will only stay in play for about 20 or so seconds they it will go away. Status effects like sleep will go away if the Pokemon is hit. So nothing in the game will be based on turns but time. The battle system is what I really want to get done. I plan on this game being the way Pokemon should be.If its also possible, I want to release 2 versions of the game. A E rated version and a T rated version so players in our age group can appreciate it."
2012-11-28T13:58:25-0800,"I wish I knew how to program games so I could help with this type of project!Yeah considering that pokemon is geared primarily towards young people, perhaps a teen version would be cool, but I have difficulty envisioning that coming to pass. I doubt pokemon would ever allow that franchise to get a teen rating. However my opinion is of little consequence. I'm sure they will sell whatever sells well. If the demand is high then times and pokemon will change."
2012-11-28T18:04:32-0800,"I love the ideas that you guys are putting out, I would definitively play this game.But I'm not sure that I like the idea of the online store. There are players(Like myself and my siblings) who are not allowed to use the online options, such as Dream World and GTS.With the Dream World and the GTS, they are easy to ignore because they do not have a big impact on the game. The item online store that you are suggesting would make it a lot harder to ignore the online features.Just a thought."
2012-11-28T18:43:16-0800,"Well, I would have to have a online store. DLC is becoming a very popular options for games. This will allow me to add new regions, missions and other cool stuff plus it would allow players to sell the in game items they make to other players players who dont or cant make them.I understand not everyone can use the internet but I cant remove it because a few people cant use it. Do realize the online features will not take away for basic game play."
2012-11-28T18:55:18-0800,"Since you've mentioned you want to be a game designer, I'd like to highlight this statement you've made briefly, because it disturbs me as another hopeful game designer.""X is popular"" is not a good reason to do something. In fact, it is one of the worst possible reasons to do something, taken alone. In marketing it seems all too common for campaigns to be structured around an idea that is ""popular"" without really paying attention to why, and such campaigns fail. It's important to really examine what you gain from something before implementing it. Something being ""popular"" should only give you the idea. It doesn't mean you should do it.In this case, an online store for Pokemon makes so little sense to me. What would you sell there - or make to sell there - that would be better than what you can already get through the Pokemart? Game Freak seems to know exactly how much they want you to work to get their items: see the Battle Frontier. They could make some kind of an online store to make getting TMs, EV items, and the like, but I don't know what they would put there that would be unique and useful without somehow breaking the game for anyone that couldn't or didn't want to use the store.There is a big difference between downloadablelike regions, missions, Pokemon, and the like - and an online store that contains items that a player might want or need to proceed.

Even if other players can just pay for nice outfits, cool cosmetic weapons, or other features, it can actually put off some other players that really like your game just as a free experience (with whatever ad revenue or hard cartridge sales you would get anyway). It was always frustrating to see people running around with awesome outfits/wings/pets/skins/etc that I couldn't get because I wasn't willing to pay for them, but know that I had no way to 'earn' them through gameplay.This is also kind of a faulty point of view. Technically speaking you're right - ADDING an online feature doesn't detract from what's already in the hard copy of the game. But especially in a competitive/community game like Pokemon, you really lose out if you miss the online features.

2012-11-24T13:15:22-0800,Awesome! Been slowly building up my Dream World home. These Dream World abilities are really fun to collect!
2012-11-24T14:25:52-0800,They are pretty cool although Truant Durrant was a step in the wrong direction :tongue:
2012-11-24T16:02:06-0800,Truant? Isn't that what Slaking has? Truant anything seems pretty awful.
2012-11-24T16:28:22-0800,"Actually Truant Durant has 1 significant niche, it can use Entrainment to force Truant on the opponent, which you can then switch out to a Shadow Tag Pokemon like Gothitelle (Chandelure being superior if it were out) to then CM up for a sweep. Granted in this day and age of team preview it's kinda obvious, but it could have worked back in the day IMO. Otherwise yeah, Truant is about as bad as an Ability can be (Slow Start being the other).Still hunting for Female Intimidate Scraggy and Iron Fist Gurdurr, though I dunno if Iron Fist is really comparable to what Guts offers. Still, it's a nice option."
2012-11-24T19:57:43-0800,"That's pretty brilliant! I've faced a few Entrainments from wild Audinos. It can really rip a great strength like Levitate or Flash Fire away from a strong challenger.If a Pokemon uses Entrainment and then switches out, does the opposing Pokemon regain it's original ability, or is it changed until that Pokemon switches out? (or does it stay all game?)"
2012-11-24T20:22:24-0800,"A simple way of getting Truant off a Pokemon and any hindering ability which makes Regigigas and Slaking dominant forces in Double battles is Skill Swap. Skill Swap allows you to move the ability from the original Pokemon to the Pokemon using the attack and vice versa.Ex. If a Telepathy Musharna were to use Skill Swap on a Traunt Slaking, Slaking will get Telepathy and Musharna will get Truant. Musharna will not care about getting Truant as its more of a wall and Slaking getting Telepathy is great just in case you have something which uses moves like Surf and Earthquake that would originally hurt Slaking.I wonder why that's never used in VGC."
2012-11-24T20:42:18-0800,The effect is on the defending pokemon.Player A uses entrainment on player B's Cresselia.Player A switches.Player B still has the entrained ability.
2012-11-25T00:11:14-0800,"Mostly because both Regigigas and Slaking have big Fighting weaknesses, which really kinda limits their usefulness if common Pokemon like Terrakion or Hitmontop can OHKO them. That and in addition you're messing up one of your Pokemon and burning turns they could be attacking instead to Skill Swap, wait out a turn with Truant, then another just to Skill Swap it onto an opposing Pokemon (assuming the use hasn't been KOed by now).Skill Swap did see some use with the 2nd place team at Worlds last year, though it was to put Levitate onto Heatran."
2012-11-25T00:38:29-0800,from what I have seen That Scraggy with Intimidate is going to be very playable for VGC. I for-sure will probally use it
2012-11-25T16:50:49-0800,"I guess it's more useful than Moxie, huh? I guess with switching, Moxie's effect doesn't last long. Shed Skin, I guess is helpful, very much in-game, but I'm not sure how much in competitive battles. Aren't status condition skills frowned upon in competitive battles?"
2012-11-25T17:13:28-0800,Status inflictions are a great way to cripple opposing teams to ruin their strategy. It will assist in getting your team in setting up or to cover things like speed- thunder wave will slow down a Pokemon and give a 50 percent chance of not being able to attack. This will give an option to risk calm mind with a higher chance to go first to pull it off.Thunder wave and Spore are the most common seen status inflictions in the competitive scene.
2012-11-25T17:14:38-0800,"Status conditions happen all the time in competitive battles with Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp being quite common. The thing is that Shed Skin only takes effect 30% of the time and it is completely useless if you don't even get a condition in the first place.Double Team/Evasion are the ones most looked down upon, but they are rarely used anyway in vgc.Moxie I am sure will still have its niche, but Intimidate will be a whole lot more common now."
2012-11-25T22:37:55-0800,@primewell the reason why I am saying it is more useful is that with so many attackers (t-tar/chomp/Top and others) and it would very well in TR teams
2012-11-28T12:03:59-0800,"Took five tries, but I found a female Scraggy. I ran across a ton of stupid ability male Pokemon, but this was pretty much the only gem out of the group."

It is the most frustrating thing for me when I play the game. You can always call too when the disconnect is going to happen, I have three pokemon left and you have one that is asleep, here it comes!My question is have they ever addressed this or tried to fix the issue! I would completely be o.k. with taking a game loss if I lost connection, whether on purpose or for reasons out of my control.Does anyone have any idea on what could be done?My random match up record is 45 and 45 but if I had received a win for when my opponent disconnected after I had the game won I would be at least 100-45 if not better! That is frustrating!"

I am realizing more and more than I am completely horrible at this game... or I don't know how to RNG so my pokemon are not the greatest but knowing where and when I make mistakes when I play would be very helpful ....
2012-10-23T12:50:38-0700,"^Believe me- you do not need to know how to RNG to be the best player, let alone have a team that has some super advantage over non-RNG'd Pokies.Having ""flawless"" Pokemon does not effect things such as crit hits, status inflictions, and other factors. Sure, a ""flawless"" Pokemon has top IV base stats and does contribute a little into the game- but stratagy and skill determins the outcome of most battles while some luck can really play a factor as well."

2012-10-15T15:52:52-0700,"Oh ,dang ... nice"
2012-10-18T14:10:12-0700,Thanks :biggrin:I tried looking gor more and i guess im just luckyI'll prolly never find another one in the game except for hatching lol
2012-10-19T17:00:55-0700,Extremely lucky if you ask me. I have obtained the Shiny Charm and have yet to encounter or hatch a new Shiny Pokemon on my B2 game.~Cyber~
2012-10-19T22:59:12-0700,I only hope you got all the Pokemon legitimately. I'm still trying to fill the Unova Dex so I can go to the Nature Preserve. It's only been a couple of weeks and you already have all 649? Hmm
2012-10-21T00:22:51-0700,"Well I have black 1 all complete, so if I really tried, I could take about 10 hours and trade them ALL over lol, im just not ready to do that yet, but slowly its coming along, i really want that shiny charm"
2012-10-21T02:08:47-0700,I have all Gen IV and V games. So I spent literally all day trading and poketransferring to complete my National Dex except for Meloetta. Juniper doesn't count event legendary Pokemon when she gives you the Permit and Charms for completing the two Pokedexes.~Cyber~
2012-10-15T01:08:31-0700,"So in white 2 I got to the nature preserve today with the shiny hax.......I caught him a few times and reset until i got a nature a wantedI got a decent nature but the characteristic I didn't kno aboutSo I turned around to leave because u can't fly away from thereAnd in the first patch of grass I stumbled into a shiny nuzleaf!So I was pretty surprised that I even found a shiny in the first place, so I caught it and saved itPretty much said ""if that's the hax im getting so be it"" lolBut then it got wierd.......I stayed to see what else is there and to my surprise i found a shiny dunsparseLiterally like 2 battles after the nuzleafNow to me that seemed a little strange, I thought maybe the area of the nature preserve had a better shiny encounter rateI looked online and came up with nothingAm i just really lucky? Or is there something there that helps with shiny cuz the place is so special?Ps. Idk if this is the right place to b posting this, ive never posted on the video game part b4 lol"

2012-10-08T21:02:21-0700,"I didn't plan on buying Black 2 or White 2, but after a small trade-in, I had enough store credit to pick it up, and boy am I happy I picked it up. I am having so much more fun playing it than I did playing Black and White.I think the big thing for me is the abundance of pre-BW pokemon found easily and early in the world. Before I even got to the first gym, I was encountering Riolus, Mareeps, and many others from Gold Silver, Ruby Sapphire and Diamond and Pearl. It was very refreshing to not have to rely only on the Black and White Pokemon.Also, I really like two new features in the games: pokedex upgrade area tool, and the medal system.I think it's really cool to be able to keep track of if I've caught all the Pokemon in a certain area. I used to always go to serebii to see if I missed any Pokemon, but now I don't have to do that, and honestly, it's more fun this way for it all to not be spoiled for me.I think the medal system is ingenious. I'm always on the lookout to see if I earned a new medal from the guy at the Pokemon Center. I have stickied the medal case as my left button quickslot so I can quickly pull it up and see which medals I am missing. It keeps my attention and pushes me to do stuff I normally wouldn't do. It's a great addition to the game.So far, I've beaten two gyms and am loving it. I wish you could breed pokemon earlier in the game, but that isn't a huge loss compared to the huge gains the game has brought along with it.I'm not sure if I can play Black and White again after playing Black 2."
2012-10-08T22:30:12-0700,"I enjoy the option for different difficulty settings and don't wish to play the game until I can play in the ""hard mode""."
2012-10-08T23:17:20-0700,"Can you get Pidgey in the first area, like before the first gym?"
2012-10-09T04:29:05-0700,"I haven't seen Pidgey. I've seen lots and lotsa Pidove, tho."
2012-10-09T05:15:12-0700,I'm sad faced now. I can always trade one over.
2012-10-09T08:17:17-0700,"Yup, only way to get Pidgey in B2W2 is through Dream World, which requires the C-Gear.I have to say I'm really liking Black 2 myself. These games really show off what a late-console-life game can do. I wouldn't be impressed with this game if it had come out on the 3DS, but as a DS game it's top notch. I splurged a little and bought the Dream Radar, too, and it's super fun. The only bad thing is I have to be careful where I play that, because I'm constantly getting people coming up and asking ""Did you just take a picture of me?!"". No, Ma'am, just shooting clouds."
2012-10-09T10:30:23-0700,Anyway to control what nature and IV's we get from the pokemon we can catch on the dream radar?
2012-10-09T12:14:33-0700,"I absolutely agree. BW2 has been a massive improvement in pretty much every way. I'm in love with the world, I adore the medal system, I feel attached to and excited about my team... Everything about this is glorious. I'm about to take on Roxie myself."
2012-10-09T21:05:04-0700,Medals = achievements
2012-10-09T21:35:12-0700,"I just got home, and I saw my package in the mail, best sight all week."
2012-10-10T11:21:37-0700,I love White 2. I've recently beaten Skyla. The jumps between each gyms Pokemon levels provides some challenge and demands a little more training. I'm surprised that you can find Riolu so early in the game (it was my first catch in the game :biggrinThe PWT is a nice addition. And the story has a lot of depth and continuity from the previous game(s).This is my team so far:SamurottGrowlitheLeavannyElectabuzzLucarioVibravaAll in the lv40'sI'm sadface that you can't catch Vulpix or Ninetales until way late in the game. But oh well. Growlithe/Arcanine will have to do for now. And i can always put in Zoroark for some foxinessAll in all its a great game. It's less grindable but i guess that's a good thing.
2012-10-10T11:56:15-0700,"I LOVE this game also!!! and the Dream Radar (I already caught the therian forme tornadus)I bet that if this came out on te 3ds it would have been better because think of all the possibilities they can do on their instead of on the other ds, like the gyroscope, 3d visuals, circle pad, 2 cameras..."
2012-10-13T01:15:06-0700,Can u actually setup difficulty? Thx
2012-10-13T05:53:20-0700,"Nope. But, even if you had max difficulty, almost all RPGs can be beaten with the same strategy. GRINDGRINDGRIND.It would be nice if opponent levels scaled to yours. But that's a pipe dream with this franchise..."
2012-10-13T13:53:12-0700,"You can unlock Easy Mode, and Hard Mode, some way, but I'm unsure of it. May be called Challenge Mode or something. One unlock in each version, which can be transferred to the other version. I think Black has easy mode, or whatever it is called.When in doubt, serebii it."
2012-10-13T15:25:22-0700,"You get a 'key' for beating the E4. White 2 is Easy key, Black 2 is Challenge key. You can then transfer them by IR to any other game, where they will be active from that point forward."
2012-10-15T04:59:51-0700,"Yep, I gotta agree. Black 2 is really hitting a home run in my books. More challenging, more inviting, more un-put-downable - even with some walkthroughs that are available. I'm finding out more new stuff about the games that I never knew before, and having a great time with it. I'm even porting over some favorite pokemon from earlier games - got a great Charizard that I raised in Black 2 from a Charmander from an earlier game. I'd rather play this game over all the other ones I've played so far (and I've played them all since R/S)."
2012-10-15T15:58:54-0700,"I'm just enjoying how awesomely bad the Pokestar Studios is. I mean, it's absolutely incredible in how terrible these television episodes are. But I can't walk away from them. They're just too engrossing. It's like, how bad can this possibly get? Then let's make it even worse!I'm stuck with 2 badges b/c of Pokestar Studios. And I'm enjoying every second of it ^_^"
2012-10-15T16:26:14-0700,"It's because you like battle puzzles. It's like those ""Win the last prize this turn"" puzzles that we had back a few christmases ago. ^_^"
2012-10-15T16:33:58-0700,"The problem is that they give away the solutions. The hardest part is choosing the correct line, and most of the time that isn't even that difficult. The only reason I failed one of them was b/c my Vanillite kept hurting itself instead of Swoobats."
2012-10-15T18:04:41-0700,"Gotta agree withbulladoson this one. I honestly thought PokeStar Studios would be much better. I don't like how they force you to make a movie the first time around. I was like ""never again"". I was just as disappointed as Roxie's dad. lolOther than THAT, the game is top notch. I beat the champion, caught most of the catchable legendaries (save for Registeel and Regigigas), now I need to see all the Unova Pokemon so I can get my shiny Haxorus. :biggrin: Also I'm gonna do the Pokemon World Tournament. I hear you get to face a certain Trainer in the Champion block :wink:Little side note: Legendaries are pretty easy to catch in my White 2. I caught some of them within the first ten throws, mainly Ultra Balls. Except for Cresselia ; she was insanely hard to catch cuz she kept healing herself with Moonlight. I ended up using my Master Ball. So I don't know if it's just me or what, but I assure I'm not running Easy Mode."
2012-10-15T18:17:05-0700,"Well my 1st goal was to get Dream radar completed ASAP for the therian forms and other legendary pokemon. Now I have finished my Black 2 and going through White 2. Still need to decided what one is going to be my ""Main"" game and what will be for resetting.PokeStar studios is like a watching a viral video. You know it is going to be horrible, but you do it anyway."
2012-10-15T18:34:48-0700,I was actually going to equate it with the Star Wars Holiday Special. Though a viral video is pretty good as well ^_^
2012-10-19T17:13:14-0700,"Any one else tempted to try the Masuda Method with a Shiny Charm in their bag? I sure am. ^_^How come no one has mentioned Memory Link yet? I think that feature is one of the best new things that came to Pokemon. I hope if there's another Pokemon Game coming out Memory Link returns to get some nice bonus features from Gen V games. Hurray for not having to earn all those Musical Props again and seeing the older Pokedex diplomas in Nuvema Town brought a smile to my face. Also, it's funny since I used the same name for the player character in both Black and Black2 and NPC's like Cheren mention me. Also, Elesa making a reference to the movie ""Airplane"" in one of the flashback made my day.Join Avenue = the 3DS's Mii Plaza except MUCH BETTER! Still trying to get someone I tagged to open up a Nursery. Guess I have to wait a little longer. I was very surprised when I found out that people who visit my home in the Dream World also come to Join Avenue. The Global Link is even more usable now! Yeah!Black 2 is a fantastic upgrade from the first game(s). I don't think I'll ever switch back to any of the older games... except HeartGold since I still love the ""walking Pokemon"" feature.~Cyber~"

I think that feature is one of the best new things that came to Pokemon. I hope if there's another Pokemon Game coming out Memory Link returns to get some nice bonus features from Gen V games. Hurray for not having to earn all those Musical Props again and seeing the older Pokedex diplomas in Nuvema Town brought a smile to my face. Also, it's funny since I used the same name for the player character in both Black and Black2 and NPC's like Cheren mention me. Also, Elesa making a reference to the movie ""Airplane"" in one of the flashback made my day.Join Avenue = the 3DS's Mii Plaza except MUCH BETTER! Still trying to get someone I tagged to open up a Nursery. Guess I have to wait a little longer. I was very surprised when I found out that people who visit my home in the Dream World also come to Join Avenue. The Global Link is even more usable now! Yeah!Black 2 is a fantastic upgrade from the first game(s). I don't think I'll ever switch back to any of the older games... except HeartGold since I still love the ""walking Pokemon"" feature.~Cyber~"
2012-10-15T18:04:41-0700,"Gotta agree withbulladoson this one. I honestly thought PokeStar Studios would be much better. I don't like how they force you to make a movie the first time around. I was like ""never again"". I was just as disappointed as Roxie's dad. lolOther than THAT, the game is top notch. I beat the champion, caught most of the catchable legendaries (save for Registeel and Regigigas), now I need to see all the Unova Pokemon so I can get my shiny Haxorus. :biggrin: Also I'm gonna do the Pokemon World Tournament. I hear you get to face a certain Trainer in the Champion block :wink:Little side note: Legendaries are pretty easy to catch in my White 2. I caught some of them within the first ten throws, mainly Ultra Balls. Except for Cresselia ; she was insanely hard to catch cuz she kept healing herself with Moonlight. I ended up using my Master Ball. So I don't know if it's just me or what, but I assure I'm not running Easy Mode."
2012-10-15T18:17:05-0700,"Well my 1st goal was to get Dream radar completed ASAP for the therian forms and other legendary pokemon. Now I have finished my Black 2 and going through White 2. Still need to decided what one is going to be my ""Main"" game and what will be for resetting.PokeStar studios is like a watching a viral video. You know it is going to be horrible, but you do it anyway."

2012-10-14T00:52:35-0700,"Hey , I was wondering if I should Soft reset for a Jolly Shiny Gible the Alder's grandson gives ? Should I ?"
2012-10-14T01:15:37-0700,I'm sure there's a way you can RNG abuse it to make it easier and take less time. Just straight soft resetting is a pain.
2012-10-14T01:51:07-0700,RNG ? What is that ?
2012-10-14T02:15:23-0700,"RNG stands for Random Number Generator. Computers can't create purely random results - they have to use some sort of pattern, and people like to study Pokemon's coding to figure out what the pattern is for things like Pokemon generation. It has to do with the timing of starting up your game, and the time setting in your DS.If you do a little research, you can find some ways to help control what the stats and nature of the Pokemon, and it'll take only a few tries instead of several hundreds or thousands of soft resets.Hopefully some other forum members have some resources to help you get started!"
2012-10-14T19:08:49-0700,"I think you can reset for a different nature. Not 100% sure, but I think so.When it comes to the grottos in the game, the Pokemon cannot be changed, but according to Serebii, you can reset to change the nature, so I would think perhaps natures are the only thing that can always be affected by a reset."
2012-10-14T19:56:55-0700,according to Serebii I looked it is any Nature so yeah you can RNG it to the Nature you want.
2012-10-14T20:57:38-0700,Awesome ! I'm battling Benja right now XD
2012-10-17T09:40:43-0700,"This was true in BW1. In BW2, the RNG is a lot harder to hit, so it's not unusual for it to take 20+ tries. If the only thing you're going for is nature (as opposed to IVs/ability/etc) it's probably easier and faster just to reset for it."

2012-10-03T18:10:08-0700,"Most likely, you are going to need Black/White 2 to play in Regionals in the Winter and Spring.

2012-10-04T08:28:00-0700,"Another question is about which pokemon are going to be good. Like are my pokemon from black and white going to still be good in black and white 2? are there new mechanics, attacks or abilities I should be worrying about?"
2012-10-04T08:51:44-0700,depends on the format after the release i think it might be kinda like vgc 11 considering the Japanese had there 1st B2W2 offical pokemon tourny and it was Unova Dex only. however thats what I think. TPCi might have something different though
2012-10-04T10:19:42-0700,"I'm pretty sure very little will change to the casually-competitive player. You are sure to be able to play between BW and BW2 cartridges, and the Pokemon are going to be largely the same - it's unlikely that there will be any dramatically weakened Pokemon, and more likely that there will be several stronger Pokemon. But you can just keep the teams you're currently using and play your BW2 friends."
2012-10-09T08:12:40-0700,"Competitively, I think the biggest differences between B2W2 and BW are the availability of the Move Tutors, and the Join Avenue Fitness Shop. Move Tutors open a bunch of new combinations up, like Hydreigon getting Roost and Superpower, or Blaziken with Dual Chop.

You're looking for the one that says something along the lines of ""a shop that trains Pokemon"". That person will open up a Fitness Shop. (It's random what shop a person will open, but I think it's linked to TID/SID.)After the shop is open, you'll need to level it up. They start off selling really simple stuff, in this case 4 EVs in a stat. But if you talk to the people that walk around Join Avenue, some of them will be looking for a shop.

2012-10-04T08:51:44-0700,depends on the format after the release i think it might be kinda like vgc 11 considering the Japanese had there 1st B2W2 offical pokemon tourny and it was Unova Dex only. however thats what I think. TPCi might have something different though
2012-10-04T10:19:42-0700,"I'm pretty sure very little will change to the casually-competitive player. You are sure to be able to play between BW and BW2 cartridges, and the Pokemon are going to be largely the same - it's unlikely that there will be any dramatically weakened Pokemon, and more likely that there will be several stronger Pokemon. But you can just keep the teams you're currently using and play your BW2 friends."
2012-10-09T08:12:40-0700,"Competitively, I think the biggest differences between B2W2 and BW are the availability of the Move Tutors, and the Join Avenue Fitness Shop. Move Tutors open a bunch of new combinations up, like Hydreigon getting Roost and Superpower, or Blaziken with Dual Chop. The Fitness Shop means that if you've got money to burn you can EV train SUPER fast. (For those who don't know, they sell items that increase EVs of one stat by up to 64. Wow!)"
2012-10-10T14:01:21-0700,And how do you get the fitness shop?
2012-10-10T14:22:42-0700,"Ummm... let's see. Join Avenue is the path between Rt. 4 and Nimbasa. It starts off empty, but if you connect to people using the C-Gear, Infrared, or Wifi their avatar will show up there. When you talk to them in Join Avenue, they should say something like ""I'm looking to open a shop that..."" and then a clue as to what shop they'd open. You're looking for the one that says something along the lines of ""a shop that trains Pokemon"". That person will open up a Fitness Shop. (It's random what shop a person will open, but I think it's linked to TID/SID.)After the shop is open, you'll need to level it up. They start off selling really simple stuff, in this case 4 EVs in a stat. But if you talk to the people that walk around Join Avenue, some of them will be looking for a shop. They'll say things like ""I'm looking for a shop that is exciting!"" or something. Direct them to the right shop, and the shop will level up. There are 10 levels for each shop. The 64 EV options are on levels 9 and 10 of the Fitness shop."

Yes, it does ignore the fact that some people will try playing with bad wifi and thus might inadvertently disconnect, but that really is the risk they take when they play imo with a bad connection.I think another option is to just have losses hidden for wifi; I think one of the psychological factors is that no one likes seeing losses on their screen, whether deserved or not.

It's like the two DSes are tied together by a string; if that string gets cut, you can't tell ""whose connection"" was cut, because there's only one connection and it represents both of them.Of course, from our human subjective point of view, we can clearly tell when we are still connected to the internet, and when we aren't still connected to the internet, but from a systems point of view there's no way to differentiate from what I know about networking/computing."

2012-09-19T15:36:43-0700,"As a comminty for all things Pokemon, we strive to provide various levels of what we can provide for the members on this site. As a whole, this site is a great community that is based around the TCG. This site has one of the best reputations for providing the TCG Community with the most complete information and discussions around, revolving around the TCG and and related topics that card gamers support and participate in.One of the slow but growing aspects of Pokemon in general is the Video Game competition being incorporated into TCPI events around the nation. The community of players with in the TCG has a small group inside the TCG members that do activly play the video game(s). Either for fun or competition- being a VG'r is still an enjoyable activity along with the TCG or individualy, or both.This is not all about change, this is about addition. A way to branch out and look into ways to imprwhat we can offer to the community. Looking into the Video game side of things, there is potentual to spark interest in new players from those who do play in the Video game to become TCG players. And the same can be said on the other end of the spectrum.How does a site like this branch out to find possible interest in growing the player base for the TCG? Is it impossible to see what and why the Video Game players might bring into the TCG scene?Why does this site even provide anything for the Video Game community?First of all, I will porvide a small amount of personal information to show what my take on this subject is.I have children. I am an active parent who take interest in what my children do. Pokemon became one of those interests. I have played in the TCG since the days of Base set. I am a true RPG Video Gamer, and Pokemon feeds into my gaming hobby. I have been to so many events, I do not even know when about the first time my son and I walked into our local Toys R Us to play the TCG.Physical issues have kept me from being able to be as active as I would like, and sitting down to play a card game at times is brutal on me. The Video Game is not as demanding on me physically, and I can stop at any time, unlike a full day of tournament play for the card game. Thus, my desire to expand a little bit further over the years into what more can I get out of playing the Video Game, and how can I orginize this to have more fun. It started out simple, at an event when I was asked ""Hay, will you battle me?"".From that day onward, it has grown into where we all are at today. Tournaments all around, everywhere, online via Wi-Fi. Even Nintendo has pumped out tournaments. League play, teams, you name- we Video Gamers have something to bring into the community.I am not asking that this site provide more then what is being provided already, nor asking that the staff go out of their way to apply even more focus onto the Video Game side of things. I was asked to assist and bring in what I have to offer for this site based on my history and knowledge of the Video Game. I see potentuel, the unity that can be brought in to include the player base to share a common interest- Pokemon. I do not think that the Video Gamers are asking for too much, but enough recognition that we are all active gamers, and a good amount of us Video Gamers are not just Video Gamers: they are TCG'rs as well. I support both the VGC and the TCG- I just happen to know a greater amount of information I can pass on to those who in the future come onto this site have a resource for all things Pokemon.I know that the title of this thread is what it is: The E4 Project: purpose and Design.I will now discuss that, from the inside view from myself who is in charge of the direction the project is going. I will say that the project is not just all on me, but an awesome group of staff are behind this as well. I will not speak on behalf of those staff members, but the project would not be where it is with out them.In order to combine this site to include the Video Game side of things, we need first consider what there is to offer. Well, the TCG has a lot to offer:How to improve a deckHow to stratagise.Rules, and rule changes.I would include more points, but if your a member of at least two months you can see what there is to offer for the TCG.When you go to a TCG event, you have a lot in your favor to back you up. You have out-side resources, you have family, friends, PTO's, Judges- they are all there to make sure your having a great time. I have been to many events, and i will say that these people put a huge amount of effort into putting a smile on your face, and to know they have a site like this to provide even more for you.So what does all of this have to do with the E4 Project?Interest. A player base. And adding this new field of fun is not easy. it is not a transition, but an inclusion. As a VG mod- my interest is looking into what can be offered on this site to help the two communities merge together, and provide the most I can into supporting this side of things with almost completely same information as the TCG'rs recieve on this site.The main purpose of the E4 is to provide an activity to the Video Gamers who visit or are members here. This site includes on-line TCG options to play, which is a competative alternative to not have to allways leave home to play. This is the idea behind the E4 Project. Have no one to battle? GO-WI-FI!Structure. Orginized. Leadership. Direction. Goals. Objective. Representing. Participation. Rewards. Recognition. All included into this by consideration. We ask no more then what we present, and the intentions behind this project is to mimic the TCG environment as close as possible that integrates the Video game.Design.This was the most discussed portion of the project. Limitations, restrictions, game boundries. Rules. Fairness. Tiers. Structure. Whom should run it, how it should be run. This was the hardest to consider since the games themselves offer so much. It is complicated to look through the eyes of every gamer.It is hard to accomidate to appeas to every gamer to make certain we have a bases for foundation to optimise the best format to use. It was not easy to exclude useable Pokemon.The end result we concluded with did not come easy. But we needed something to try out, to test run a project that we are looking to expand on into a larger system. But trial and error is the only method we have to see what will work with the gamer community. This is not a simple tournament, that is for sure. I did not want to run a simple tournament. I saw potentual in a system that sort of replicates the Video Games. I also wanted to include the members of this site. Participation is one thing, but being active in the actual process of representing could be rewarding on it's own for a good number of people.A challenge.The games themselves have a set out story line, that we wanted to include in our Project. The games have pre-set gyms. That we incorporated into this design. But keeping it a challenge is the hard part. If we allow to much freedom for both the challengers and the E4 representatives, it come across as a tournament but only looking to defeat 4 players over all. It seemed to simple, and not much of a challenge.One of the things us VG mods are doing is to provide skill and stratgies into this site for those who are new (and old) to build upon thier gaming skills. The E4 Project includes that aspect: work with what you have. If you go register a deck at Regionals, are you allowed to switch up your decks? No, thus a part of the mechanics we included to keep it a challenge. We do Pokemon of the Week- a provision to assist gamers at looking to improve their play as well. Now that the VGC is a part of TCG events, we should include equiping those VG'rs with something, and not just left out.The E4 project is an activity that apparently is: (by responce and IMO to it so far)Too soon. This site is not ready.Not enough VG'rs to support this idea.Not structured in favor by the majority of player base.Too confusing.No one knows for sure what is going on.Just something not warrenting enough to even be on this site.Really great idea, just not what was/is expected.No prizes announced as of yet, why bother. (still in the works, since the beginning of all of this)(As a gamer myself, sometimes a prize is just knowing I stomped xxxxx amount of players with my team :thumbWhat ever the reasons, We are not sure of. I thought I would come in here, spill out the beans a bit, and to let you Video Gamers know your not alone, and being supported and offered something to the best we can. I am here to listen, to support, and to assist in growing the TCG scene just the same as all of the TCG staff is in the interest of doing. The TCG staff have taken a big step out to try new things, and I will not let them fail or fall flat on their backs for trying. They listened to us gamers, we need to step it up to show we can provide this community with the tools we have to provide. Another purpose of the E4 project.Over all, I am satisfied with the results so far with the E4 project. I am proud of the site staff whom have work hard on getting this idea as well- with out them, this would not even be at the point it is as right now. Props to them, they deserve recognition for their efforts. Even if it completely flops- it never hurts to try, and it is something to build upon for the future. As long as the games are around- so will I.I encourage anyone to speak their mind on this subject. As a community, we should grow and expand together. I welcome critisizm as well as suggestions as to what more can be done to provide the gaming community with something. Anything.I also tried to bring to the table something a bit out of the norm, trying something I have not seen anywhere else on the web/net. (that I am aware of) Maybe I am a bit way to far out there of the norm to create a project like this. It is still to me a learning experiance, and a way to reach out to the gaming group.Thank you all for your time in reading this, again I ask for your thoughts, your questions, suggestions- you name it- how else can the E4 Project be something (or nothing) that can be an activity on this site?What should change? What should not change? Should this be something on a site such as this? Is the video game community to small right now for this project?"
2012-09-19T16:10:53-0700,"As a part of the staff involved in constructing this event, let me repeat something that was mentioned above; a ton of discussion and planning went into developing this idea.14 pages of discussion went into developing this idea. Each page had an average of 25 posts.That's over 350 posts, from May till now, 4 months... an average of 3 posts per day for 120 consecutive days.This project and the projects connected to it are very much loved creations of the staff working on them. We want to see them grow, evolve, and ultimately provide a fun experience for you, the members of the PokeGym community.I'm not a VG person. I own practically every video game, but I don't play them competitively. I haven't even beat Black/White and will likely buy Black2/White2.Even though I'm not well-educated in the VG environment, I agreed completely when it was suggested to add a VG area to this site. Like Benzo mentioned, the VGC has become as much a part of the entire Pokemon event package as the TCG events. It was time for the PokeGym to catch up with the times.Benzo has been the solid force behind these events, and much kudos should go to him for trying to motivate the creation of more VG elements on this forum. He only thinks of you, the community.I guess the last thing I want to say is that the last thing I, nor any of the staff want to do is exclude certain types of VG players from the events we are trying to run. Just because we may run VG events doesn't mean they will operate like high-end VGC events. Our number one goal is to create a fun environment for the members of the community. Don't let fear of not having adequate Pokemon hold you back from taking part in an event we're trying to run. You never know how you'll do until you try. And you never know if you'll truly enjoy the experience until you try it."
2012-09-19T19:03:37-0700,So what you're saying is...it's postponed?
2012-09-19T23:36:05-0700,"Nope- not postponed at all. It is still in full effect, I am looking to get some early feedback is all.I am the type of person, that the only way this would get postponed is if somehow, the Pokegym just stopped existing..."
2012-09-19T23:51:23-0700,"Ah. I was mislead by this section.I thought you were listing reasons for postponing it =pEither way, Its nice to see some support heading towards the pokegym battles. Its unfortunate they've been a bit of a flop. I'd like to see some motivation to play pokegym battles on the tcg side of things, but that's a different topic.I look for forward to participating!"
2012-09-20T10:59:55-0700,"Dear members of the Pokegym VGC Community - Staff and Players alike.Two years ago or so, I was playing Pokemon TCG with many friends here. I came to watch for strategies, discuss new decks and cards, and participate in the community events and discussion. It was something of a home for me. But it wasn't quite what I wanted.Rogue_Archetype either created or joined (can't remember which) a discussion about community. It's only slightly related, so I'll try to be quick, but to summarize - I completely didn't understand his point of view, which in turn represented the mentality of the Pokegym. I believed that the Gym needed to evolve to suit the players and members that were participating there. And R_A didn't disagree - but he felt that there was an inner vision that needed to be preserved.I don't know what really changed, but between now and then, I came to understand what that inner vision represented. Now I really appreciate it, and this site, much more than I once did.When it comes to the video game community, we have one massive rival. The name is censored here, but I don't think I need to spell it out; the ones who know, know. I will call them the Experts - because that's really what they are. With unrivaled community, loyalty, and understanding of the metagame, theydefineSingles gameplay. They determine thetiers. They determine therules. Andfollows those tiers and rules. If you hop on Wifi to play someone in a Singles match, the odds are, they're playing by the Experts' rules and tiers, and often, using sets defined in the Experts' analyses, as well.But the Experts don't have something that we do:The Experts have been offered some truly amazing opportunities to host official events for other companies, to join forces with big names and really become an integral part of the video game world. But they haven't. They exclude themselves, confident and comfortable in what they have built. But it has weaknesses, and one of those weaknesses is the reason we don't allow reference to their site, no matter how incredible of a resource it is to any VG player: they are lax and vulgar. I've lurked their forums many times. It's a nice enough place, honestly, but... well, I mean, I just looked now, and there's a thread OPENLY DISCUSSING DRUGS.don't mind, but clearly, that kind of thing can't be allowed in a space where children are allowed to view, post, discuss, and learn.That is the strength we have, that the Experts do not, and likely never will.We are allies to the parents, the children, that drive Pokemon onwards. We can offer something to a community that the Experts can never touch.This is the inner vision that R_A was going for, I think:we represent a higher standard of professionalism and openness. By being stricter about our content and its suitability for children, we reach a larger audience of Pokemon players, rather than a more specific one.This is what we need to use to our advantage.The Experts are a place for those who already understand Pokemon tosharpen their understanding.With quality analyses of Pokemon-by-Pokemon statistics, movesets, and comparisons, as well as pages and pages of full-team ratings and critiques, the sheer amount of high-level discussion is unmatched.They define competitive and casual play.That's their niche - they provide a place to play and to practice. But they don't really provide a place to learn.We can,and should, strive to provide a family-friendly playing environment.That's something we can offer that the Experts cannot.We can,and should,provide resources for players that are not interested in hacking, cheating, or otherwise illegitimately obtaining their Pokemon.That's something else that we can offer - and even be excited about - that the Experts cannot.But most importantly,we should focus on providing a place for the absolute beginner to get their start.The Elite 4 does not provide for this goal. It accomplishes some other very important things, and I feel that the Elite 4 is definitely a strong move. Maybe even the best one the Gym could take right now. But if you were to ask me what it lacked, this is definitely what I would tell you:Competitive Pokemon is an overwhelming cascade of information, matchups, and options. It's what makes it so daunting for me to switch to VGC,Imagine someone with little knowledge of either! (That's mostly for my benefit, as I understand it there are many people who are in that position, or know others who are. ^ ^"")This leaves several important questions that need to be answered before we can really continue.I don't know what has been discussed already, but from where I stand watching the Elite 4 program get its start, I have many questions and few answers.I've only learned as much as I have because I've had the chance to practice on simulators. The problem, of course, is that these simulators - much like the Experts' site - cannot be trusted to be PG. But it isn't out of the question for the Pokegym to create a Pokemon Online, Shoddy, or maybe even a Showdown server - once that actually starts being a thing - where we can practice without having to go to the effort of meticulously raising our Pokemon first, only to find that they are flops.We've already discussed a lot of Singles RMTs - I've tried to bring some high-level discussion to the Gym, and the data I've collected have been useful - but I see very little Doubles discussion, even though that's what the Gym seems to be more interested in, and what I sincerely would like to learn more about.How can we promote this format?For those who might not know, 'the Experts' balance competitive Singles play very,verycarefully. They have a long, drawn-out process for testing the power levels of individual Pokemon that seem too strong for 'standard' play, and they use statistics from simulators to determine what belongs at what level - from standard, to sub-standard, to sub-sub-standard... and so forth. This allows a player to use whatever Pokemon he likes in their home environment where they have a chance to shine.Will the Pokegym try to replicate this system? Do they have something else in mind? Will they do something similar to tiering for Doubles (which I think would be amazing)?This is our opportunity to open the doors to younger players who don't know how to raise their Pokemon like the pros - what about a no-EVs format? A no-TMs format? A no-breeding format? Okay, maybe that last one is a bit much... but really! This is where we really open the doors to players that are too intimidated by the Experts. Play at your level of comfort. Play, even!One last thing.Benzo stated this list in his post.It's a list of things the TCG 'offers' its players, in terms of discussion and interest.How doesn't the VG provide every one of these things?These are thingsWEcan make. We can cater them to our needs, desires, and most importantly, our users.The VG community on the Gym, right now, is very small. Our greatest weakness is really that there isn't much interest or discussion, and it's hard to know where to go with such a small beginning. But we know what kind of people weto attract. And between Benzo, Vaporeon, and - if I may be so bold- myself, you have a lot of very knowledgeable and motivated people to draw ideas and energy from, and will do what they can to make this project the best it can be....I'm going to go build a doubles team now."
2012-09-20T11:39:15-0700,"As a player very inexperienced with the video games competitively, I agree with these sentiments. I was considering entering this E4 thing, but seeing how I had no idea how hard it would be (Where it would fit in a scale where easy is the in game story and hard being actual competitive event), I thought against it."
2012-09-20T14:50:41-0700,"You bring alot of good points, Kayle. Thank you for speaking up. That is what is needed in this department.I will address some of your points in a bit later- (you know, read, re-read to make sure I get spot on read of all your post contains to reply proporly is all)I will say this- reaching out to test the waters without a solid level of where to begin to meet the majority is tough. Too easy, and people turn away. Too complicated, same result. Thus, finding that happy medium is the goal. Without knowing exactly where the community stands, why they stand, and how they want to stand is trial and error on my part to give a foot hold to make a standing zone where all is welcome is tough. Thus, my desire to build upon. And accomplishable, with group effort.One other thing: We are looking to build up to a larger scale system. That system will be easier to accomidate everyone better. This project is a total test run, we needed a start, we need feed back, and we need to see how large of a crowd we have right now. Making this project a perminent activity on here is an option, but this idea has been scaled down at least 60% from my original idea.Yes, the VG area is on the quite side of things on here, but I am glad to see more voices speaking up. The voice will get louder, it will take time is all. My intent is to draw out those voices to be heard, and to build up as a group to put more into the community."
2012-09-21T20:54:30-0700,"Tons of good points Kayle.I will speak for myself and only myself.If I were to develop a system for the PokeGym, I would base it on the official VG format, and leave it at that. No tiers, no special rules, whatever other toppings that other people put on their pizza aren't put on the traditional VG pizza. I feel, anything that creates a different playing experience than what would be experienced at a VG event isn't worth investing time into. What use does it come in if all you do singles play but all the VGC events are double battles?Also, I would frown upon any artificial system to ""play"" the game. Yes, it's lame to invest all the time to get a Pokemon to whatever level with whatever ability, skills, item attached, etc, and then find out he's not amazing, but on the opposite side of that, it requires very little time and effort to change a few drop down menu options and have a level 50 charizard with the perfect skills, ability, item attached, etc. In the end, at least with the first option, you have a probably semi-decent Pokemon that can still be modified (attacks and item) some, while with the other system, you eventually have to go out and do the massive breeding/EV training/IV egg hatching dance to get that ""perfect"" Pokemon.And, this forum is so connected to the official game, that any promoting of software used to provide a similar service as the actual video games should be frowned upon. Yes, the forum has a section for online tcg programs, so perhaps this point is moot, but I still feel a little dirty promoting people to use an outside software to learn about the game instead of actually playing the game.I think you're absolutely right Kayle that the PokeGym needs to figure out a way to appeal to those who are interested but don't know where to start. I think Trainer's Choice article series helps some with that, but it's still probably a little over the head of brand new players.I'm definitely a VG noob, if there ever could be one. So, I can understand where people are coming from. The whole ordeal seems really daunting to me. Perhaps I can use my lack of experience to better understand how to appeal to this crowd.Again speaking for myself, but I'm really impressed with your post, and I think it'd be great if we could get you on our staff team. I think your passion would definitely improve the quality of VG products providing on this forum."
2012-09-21T23:55:31-0700,"As a new comer the competitive vgc this year, i found pokemon online to be critical to my extremely fast learning curve.Its a downloadable client and the team making process is every user friendly....I'd say its probably easier to use than playtcg.I think it'd be a shame to exclude the program from ""official pokegym events"""
2012-09-22T00:36:56-0700,"ahhhh- the days of starting out, and look where we are today.From what I see, from when I became a member (sheesh, I would be a longer timer member on here if I was aware that this site existed back in the day)- we have a growth, an expansion, and a small VG community that is in a time of acceptance and merging.It is one thing to go onto a site and use a Program to pre test a team and the what not-But a true gamer will always triumph with a win that was worked for. Regardless.That is what other sites are for, that sort of stuff. I am not against people doing it, for it is out there. I do not promote it, nor do I look down upon it. But, like I said- this gamer is true to the spirit, and my work has paid off and is truelly satisfying. Without a real challenge, it is not something to improve upon, nor a way to have to look around to find the easy route.Adding onto this site to include the VGC is not as easy as it looks, but at least there is a staff community that is willing to work togather with us VG'rs. They have given the chance, we stepped up. Now we are on the task of looking into what can and what can not be, and what should and what shouldn't change.I encourage the VG community to keep speaking, we are listening. We may not agree with every aspect or point of view- but we are tossing out what we think is hopefully an interest to the VG'rs in a fun way.Work with us, we work with you. We may have limits, but limits with reason. The VG members are free to choose to participate or not, we offer what we have is all. And so far, I believe we are off to a sweet start with everything up to this point. Us gamers need to toss around the discussions is all, and we will see what we can do (and what we can not do)-"
2012-09-22T06:03:09-0700,"If it's gaining new participation from members who don't regularly play the vgc, limiting them to using their physical team against people who have a completely ev / iv developed team would be a good way to get them discouraged pretty quickly.How long does it take to EV train and IV bread a team? 20-30 hours? If you are maybe thinking of joining this tournament that twenty hour barrier is a huge motivation block."
2012-09-22T07:09:36-0700,"Physical team means their actual Pokemon in the video game, is that correct?Who is assuming that the Elite 4 members have completely ev/iv developed Pokemon? We were letting members of the community become one of the elite 4, so it's not like we've specifically picked the best four players in the nation to compete again; these people are just like you and me, and they will have Pokemon like you and me. Good pokemon, I would bet, but I wouldn't assume the ""best"" pokemon.I think it is important to compete in the physical (cartridge) game. Learn about the game wherever you want, try out ideas in 'simulators', but ultimately come back to the actual game and implement and battle. What is the point of playing the video game if you're not actually playing on the cartridge? That would be like letting TCG players compete at Cities/Regionals/Worlds over Apprentice or Redshark.Shouldn't it be fun to try, just so you can say you tried? When did it become the standard policy to not try something that doesn't look easily accomplished?I understand we may be talking about young teens - adults, and that the Elite 4 event may not be the best event for the newer player, but even newer players have to get their feet wet sometime and there will be losses along the way."
2012-09-22T23:09:16-0700,"Prime, I'm a little rushed and tired at the moment, but I'll respond to what I can/what I feel is most important.Let's agree to disagree about simulators. If the Staff and the Gym overall want to restrict gameplay to hard cartridges, I totally understand and respect that. All I can say is that I would know only a fraction of what I know about competitive Pokemon - and would possess a proportionately reduced drive to teach others to play - if I had not been introduced to Pokemon Showdown. It's an invaluable resource to people without the time or the investment to really try to build a serious team, but who are curious enough to be roped in gently. I understand that people really love building teams and breeding/training their own Pokemon (heck, my gf only played for that - she had no desire to actually BATTLE them, she just liked HAVING them), and I don't mind that aspect myself, but it's frustrating to try to actually build something serious, and just hope it 'works' without prior testing.Imagine breeding hours and hours for a hidden power, only to realize that you should've gotten a DIFFERENT hidden power, because the one you have isn't relevant. (Or maybe you make a change in your team that makes it irrelevant.) Really, hidden power in general is just a joke in the games itself, but hopefully it gets my point across.To be fair, regarding the Elite 4, I automatically assumed that the Elite 4 - while they'd be rotated around some - would be skilled players. In fact, I'd be disappointed to bring my basic Singles knowledge, build a Doubles team, and find that my elite 4 opponent knows about as much about doubles as I do (if not less, even). Perhaps I'm in the minority, or not the target audience. All I can tell you is what I personally see and experience.Promoting a Wifi league is definitely the best way to introduce players IMO. I got kind of excited about the idea of ""building blocks"" formats, where players can bring teams to their comfort level of training/testing/experience and expect to be paired against opponents of similar nature, but I'm not so clear on the implementation or enforcement of that."
2012-09-23T06:40:59-0700,"I don't see a problem with learning new pokemon combinations in a simulator, but it should all find its way back to the cartridge.Someone can be the best online simulator player in the world, but when a VGC comes around, they'll have to bow out because they won't have the actual Pokemon on their cartridges.Yes, it does take a whole lot of the time out of testing new ideas, and I guess that is a huge appeal, but we can't promote using the simulators for everyday use, idea crafting, testing, and battling. That eliminates that actual game from the equation. Pretty much the simulators steal money from Nintendo because players don't have to play the actual game to actually play the game.Like I said earlier, I'm fine with TCG players learning how to play competitively over Redshark, but ultimately they have to buy the actual cards and build the actual deck to take to the tournament. That is how it should work in the VG, too, in my opinion, where ultimately each player should have to get those Pokemon in the actual game."
2012-09-23T09:20:53-0700,"I think you're taking this metaphor a little to far. I'm not suggesting at all that sanctioned tournaments allow players to use simulators.The point I was trying to make is: if you're running this tournament as a means of attracting new interest, it'd be best done by opening it to the biggest market. Limiting players to catridges will lower overall participation from those who don't already participate."
2012-09-23T12:58:31-0700,"Methinks maybe you're missing the point. If you're the best simulator player in the world, you are the best Pokemon player in the world. There is no difference (the simulators replicate every part of the game, including evasion/critical hits that many hardcore Singles players hate) except that you don't necessarily have to spend the hours to build your own team. If the player in question wished to participate in a VGC, of course, they should need to spend all of the time and energy to create their actual team on a cartridge, but they will have the benefit of knowing what they want to create before they actually create it. That may not be an unfair advantage, but it's certainly nice!Other than this I pretty much completely agree with you, so there we go.@Backwards (didn't feel like trying to spell it...), I have some ideas already for how to circumvent the difficulty of playing/building on cartridges. What if you could have some PokeGymmers who just liked building/training Pokemon make bits of your team for you? You could earn better/more complex/rarer Pokemon through playing in the league. Juts a singular idea, but one I like."
2012-09-23T15:36:39-0700,"When TCPI has an event that sports the VGC, there are no simulators that are provided at the event for people to use. Now, it could be countered to say that online and sites- yes, an advantage for the possible use of a simulator.The main factor in using actual physical cartridges is that you can not transfer the Pokemon onto a cartridge without a lot of gimmicks to get your game cartridge to be as legit as legit can be. Sure, you can program away, and do what ever to your game- but if it does not come in as legit by any means, your not looked at as a person who did the real hard actual work that is involved to reward your efforts.I can see the design behind simulators, and it is something to look into. We can look into it all we want, discuss it until we have some sort of idea, then put some action behind the idea- make a proposal. But it will not hold much of an ounce of consideration right away.Look at the nice incline of interest and support for the VG has right now. Is it super huge, and we are the #1 site for VGC? No. Could we be #1 someday? Possible. It is a goal to aim for. I do not think that a simulator style option is something that is going to be a quick and simple ""yes"", but it is not going to be brushed aside discussion wise.We need to take steps, small ones. It takes time, planning, and a great deal of things are simply out of our hands as it is. Personally, most of the staff on here I know are all good willed people who are reasonable. But with in the reason, there is a point the ""No"" is for well thought out reasons as to why a ""No"" is given. I can not and will not speak on behalf of them, but it is a unity of effort to find what can be offered on this site with heavy consideration.As the VG scene grows and advances on this site, we need more then just staff and a community of members. We need to have resources to assist in providing things in order for ideas to work.Having the easy access of game cartridges is so far the best and most open option to work with. Seriously, in this day and age with electronics and what it can do and how often it changes, we should first look into what is consistant and reliable the most.I am not for or against simulators being on here. I do not know enough about them for 1, 2: I do not know this site and the programming at all as to what works and what does not, 3: I am a mod with the simple desire to be a midway point to keep the site busy and clean while up-holding the best interest of everyone to have a happy medium.Using cartridges is IMO the best open option to start things out with. People show up at TCPI events with their cartridges, at least from my point of view it demonstrates that they put effort into bringing their ""work"" with them, and to show they have the skill to win with what they have to work with.I believe a good number of players are to bent on ""flawless"" Pokemon, regardless of how obtained. Trust me- I have wins under my belt through pure skill. Regardless of ""flawless"" Pokemon. If the game was in so much favor of ""flawless"" Pokemon, there really is no reason for hidden/random mechanics built in like critical hits, or, ""This team is flawless, so ignore sandstorm damage"" type of factors. Even the best mis-play and lose, and they had RNG'd Pokemon.The amount of hype that ""flawless"" Pokemon has IMO is fine for the people who do it, but it does not weigh in much as far as skill, or the ability to know how to run a team. It is cool and all to be proud to have a ""flawless"" Pokemon, it does show your intellect level and skill to know and understand programming, sure it ""save's time"" and all- but really it boils down to skill, some luck, and you can not prpare for everything in battles.Keep in mind that nothing discussed is a garuntee, or that it is an absolute ""No/Yes"" deal. Who knows what the future has in store."
2012-09-23T17:57:38-0700,"If someone who only uses simulators declares themselves the best Pokemon player in the world, I will show up on their doorstep with my DSiXL and ask them to prove it. Because, ultimately, that's the only way to do it.Yes, it simulates everything from the video games, but it isn't a replacement for the video games. I feel too many people think it is a replacement, and that they never need to purchase the physical cartridges. This is a slap in the face of Nintendo, the creators of the game that the simulators copy, and in my honest opinion, lazy of them.They don't want to put the time into breeding, etc, to get the best Pokemon. They want to use some drop down menus, input a few numbers, and presto the perfect Blaziken. How can someone feel proud of themselves doing this?I understand there are great learning tools out there on the internet, but in my opinion, nothing will take the place of sitting across from another player, with your DS out, and battling over the cartridges.And for someone to suggest I support an event, that is taking place solely over simulators, disgusts me. I will never support that. I can't speak for the other staff on this site."
2012-09-23T18:22:38-0700,"Not allownig people to use simulators for the videogame, is like saying from now on, all TCG competitions in the PokeGym have to be done with actual cards througb Skype and no proxies allowed.Yes Prime, being the best at a simulator IS being the best in the actual videogame, and if you show up at his doorstep for him to prove it, he'll enter a DNS address, download the .pkm files he needs of perfectly LEGIT and RNG'd Pokemon, use vitamins and feather to EV his Pokemon to have the perfect stats, and beat your imperfect IV'd team.Based on these posts, I don't think you guys (Prime/Benzo) have researched enough or are knowledgeable enough of the current VGC state and how people get their Pokemon.RNG manipulation is extremely easy once you learn it, but that initial step, of going through calibration, learning new terms like seeding and having to use Chatter from Chatot a lot WILL confuse people and THAT is the entry barrier here.playtcg.me disgusts you then? You don't think people should boast about their deck being pretty good because how can they be proud they're winning on a simulator?At the end of the day, it's not about 'being proud' or taking 'your work' to an official VGC event and going 0-5. You want the best odds of winning and thus you get perfect IV'd Pokemon, you EV them perfectly, and then use your moves and strategy. IV's and EV's are just boring paperwork, but necessary nonetheless."
2012-09-23T18:57:47-0700,"And they pretty much violate the rules from TCPI by essentially using hacked Pokemon when people download them like that...don't take it the wrong way, we're not blind to how some people get their Pokemon for use (of which discussion is against the rules here), but it's fairly blatant cheating when you're downloading Pokemon like that and you show up to a VGC tournament where they can't detect it unless you're pretty lazy and go over 510 EVs. But that's another issue regardless of battling skills.Anyways, as for simulators themselves, just my thoughts on it I personally don't have issues with them, they're great for practicing and such. However, to me anyways, they fall into a pretty gray area as far as legality is concerned, I mean even if the makers aren't making money or asking for donations, they're still using copyright sprites and such. It's like how the one other TCG sim got shut down for using card images in their program, though the name of that one escapes me. So until that issue gets decided, I'd rather lean on the safe than sorry side and opt for physical carts for now for the purpose of tournaments and such here."
2012-09-23T19:06:43-0700,"These sections of your post are utterly unrelated, and I hope you see how that is the case. From a purely competitive standpoint, playing the simulator is playing Pokemon. But I'd never say that you should play an event with simulators, that you shouldn't care about raising your Pokemon legitimately, that we shouldn't be expected to support Nintendo, or that simulator play is in any way superior or preferable. Thanks, Pablo, for hitting a number of key points in perfection.I actually will take a possibly surprising stance and point out that IVs don't matter THAT much in the long run, especially in the VGC format where they only make half as much a difference. You should check the IVs of the things you breed (my first Scizor had an Attack IV of 2... no good.) but you don'tto go for perfect. I like to. It's fun. I don't want to say that everyone should, however, and I'd like to promote an environment where people don't feel pressured to.This is where I will step away from Pablo. We aren't the mainstream audience of competitive Pokemon players, and that's what makes us different, and gives us some different rules. The Experts play on simulators and hack their Pokemon together (legitimate or not) because raising the Pokemon is something of a waste of time to them. It's not a waste of time to us - it's part of the point.My point would only be that we should be open to players using a simulator to learn to play, and then bring their team to their official cart for official gameplay. I'm really kind of sad/worried to see that Prime misunderstood me so badly as to think I outright disagreed with him, because I don't. I would like to allow and promote discussion of simulators as learning tools... but I wouldn't push to use them as a competitive medium.I hope I'm making more sense. =\"
2012-09-23T20:08:44-0700,"I just view playing sims as the same thing as playing on PlayTCG, Apprentice, or Redshark. They're used for testing purposes. They're used for organizing online tournaments (at least, until TCGO can do that). What's really the difference? Pokegym already uses the three above for their ""official"" online tournaments, why can't they use the sims for their online VG tournaments?"
2012-09-23T20:26:30-0700,"@Pablo- You under estimate the knowladge I have about the games, and the mechanics. My research is extensive, not 100% thurough to the point that I can do the stuff second hand nature- but I know quite a bit more then you would think. I see your stand point, and your entitled to it. Your welcomed to discuss further, but please keep in mind that it does not mean that since a point of view is in disagreement on something that it does not validate the knowledge of a person on a subject.I have no problems with battling a person with a perfect team- I still win 80% of all of my battles. And I have stomped flawless teams, left and right, and I could do it all day with a 80% consistancy rate. It is in my opinion that a person can not win 100% of the time consistantly with a flawless team. I know the RNG mechanics, I know the process, I know of the programs out there- and believe me- every single one of those programs/simulaters is even 100% garunteed win success rate for the player.Hmmmmm- example- a 100% flawless rain dance Politoad and Kindra team, along with Starmie and Cressalia- 100% loss to my one Shedinja. Yup. Simulate that predictable outcome, sure- but in real life the win was worth a compliment from an opponant who knows you can not prepair for everything, and knows that my Shedinja was not flawless, just ev'd in speed and attack.I may not know every aspect of the simulator scene as a whole, but the design and uses behind them are something of consideration. All I ask is that you bring a legit team to the battle, and have the skills to show that you did not take the lazy route to present your game."
2012-09-23T21:23:30-0700,"Kayle I think your knowledge is a little outdated. Benzo, I think your aims are a little lofty right now. Here's my thoughts on what I've read so far:1. The site you're all referring to stopped being the goto site for VGC and is fairly irrelevant in the VG Modified format now. The staff who used to do that part of the work decided to start up a new site for many of the reasons you mentioned. It's focused on creating an artificial metagame and filled with content we really don't want to have to explain to parents or children who we actually have to face and talk to at events.2. Simulators are a perfectly fine way of testing a team just like PlayTCG, Pokemon TCG Online, or Redshark. Opening a pack has no effect on your playing skill and neither does breeding (although some of our best breeders are in fact our best battlers!).3. You need to accept the Gym for what it is. You will not be the #1 website. There is already a giant VGC community that has been growing for the past many years. What your goal should be, is the same as it is for TCG on Nugget Bridge. You can see ourforum layout here. Use your Video Game forum to introduce TCG players to the video game in an environment they're comfortable with and players they know. Point them to these other resources they have available.For example, Nugget Bridge does not publish TCG articles. It's not because we don't like the TCG. It's because we understand our focus. We discuss the TCG because we like it and we want to talk to others in the community about it, but we have accounts on sites like PokeGym, SixPrizes, TheTopCut, and another site I think might be censored here as well. We point to these places for resources. The Gym is the best site for competitive TCG news. SixPrizes has the most in-depth articles (regardless of what you think about the site). TheTopCut features the best media coverage you'll get.I think the Gym can provide a valuable service to TCG players trying to get into the video game, but not the way it's currently laid out."
2012-09-23T22:00:42-0700,"That is 100% NOT true. These downloaded .pkm files are simply the data you generated in the game, transferred into another format.I would give you link examples, but the site is not allowed on here. There are several dedicated members to providing Pokemon to whomever is attending a Regionals. Flawless, 100% LEGIT bred Pokemon, no meddling with Action Replay or anything of the sort. These dedicated players are making their Pokemon available either by trading them to you, or uploading the .pkm data files to make the process go by far faster. All you do by choosing the .pkm files route is skipping the part where you BOTH have to be online at the same time for a trade. Seems pretty efficient and logical to me.No one is generating Pokemon out of the blue and taking them to the VGC. Everyone is manipulating the RNG (which is quite easy in BW version for both breeding and catching exactly whatever you want) and getting their nice Level 1 Pokemon from eggs, feeding them vitamins and then attaching items and giving them PokeRus to get them to where they want them to be. EVERYTHING completely LEGAL, no cheating whatsoever. I've done it myself PLENTY of times, getting me a flawless Terrakion and Victini, but once I saw people's generosity in providing participants free Pokemon to use, I stopped doing that and started trading, purely out of laziness.I don't understand the sentence I bolded.Regarding your example: Not only is ONE battle not good enough to prove anything, the current rules allow for teams to be previewed. So if your opponent did not bring a Pokemon or two to counter Shedinja just means he's bad, regardless if he was using a perfect team or his starter Pokemon that he chose.Secondly, the 'design and uses' behind the simulators are exactly the same as those of playtcg, PTCGO, apprentice, redshark, etc. Are you going to tell me you've NEVER used those or you don't approve using those, and the only way you'll test is using real cards because otherwise you can't prepare for everything?"
2012-09-23T22:20:17-0700,"Guys, I really don't think this discussion about simulators or downloaded Pokemon is going anywhere. There's a lot of merit to both sides of the downloading discussion, but the simple fact right now is that the Gym has to take an anti-cheating and anti-flash-cart stance because of its connections and political position. We're not in a position to debate it. Simulators can be discussed later."
2012-09-23T22:25:12-0700,"I doubt going to a faux GTS (if this is the one I'm thinking of) and downloading Pokemon really counts as not cheating...and last I checked, I'm fairly certain that TCPI would probably frown big time on people uploading and downloading Pokemon files into their game for use or others to use. Obviously RNG is another issue, but something like downloading .pkm files into your game is probably crossing a line somewhere, even if the people running this stuff have no way of catching it. I mean, at face value it's probably just a more efficient way of cloning, but still.So anyways, nothing more about that topic like Kayle said :thumb:"
2012-09-23T22:40:18-0700,"It's exactly the same as trading. I can't even see how it is an issue or it is frowned upon and cannot be talked about, and I believe this exact stance on things is why VGC will not take off in this forums. NuggetBridge is to the 21st century what Pokegym is to the medieval ages with this stance on VGC IMO. And since the 3x World Champion RNG's his Pokemon along with every single other Worlds competitor at least, receiving a .pkm file over going to the WiFi center to trade with another person is neither cheating nor should it be frowned upon.Just MO."
2012-09-23T23:03:22-0700,"I do think the simulator conversation is needing to halt. I can lock this thread- I do not want to do so. Having a discussion is one thing, debating is another even if valid points are in favor on both sides of the deal. I will leave it at this:If an offical program is created to allow us VG'rs a simulator program to use, I will promote it. Until then, Pablo and Kayle- good points, let's wait until some time in the future to see what becomes available to us VG'rs and go from there.Again- good points, yet we need to see what other options are open for us VG'rs on here and work with what we have to use.Cool?So, the E4-What about tournaments? any sort of tournament would be good. Single, or doubles. The design behind the E4 is to mimic the actual games, but with some web/net interaction with out having to be physically at a location or event.With what the games offer, there are plenty of things that can be brought up to create some sort of battle activity that everyone can gain something from.These are the ideas I am looking for, ideas that can become a possibility then into action with an end result that is involving the on-line/wi-fi community.So, suggestions on changes to the E4 is welcome, or any other ideas that could be generated into just adding more into this area of the site.Last little note: With simple respect, Kayle and Pablo, the heat is off for the simulator subject for the time being. It has been recognized, and with the respect it is something that may some day see the light on here. Until then, let's look for other options for what can become something that adds into the VG side of things."
2012-09-24T05:43:58-0700,"Perhaps instead of allowing applications to be an Elite 4 member, there could be a competition, with the top 4 becoming Elite 4 members. This way, people know who each member is, probably even faced one or two of them previously. They don't seem so scary, so intimidating; they are just another fellow member, but a skilled trainer none-the-less."
2012-09-27T14:27:10-0700,"I think we should proceed as planned, since as of right now there is not much time to formulate and prep for a tournament. I have faith that we have a decent start- and we could possibly look into the options of having a tournament to decide who should represent. It is the plan to gather input, responce, and inter action with the members on here.This thread will stay open for now, to allow more input to roll in to see if and what could change for the E4 project. But it is important that we follow through with the design at this time, and see how things go.I still welcome input and ideas, so please feel free to chip in suggestions everyone."
2012-10-02T16:58:50-0700,Thats what I was thinking but decided against it because we want it to be more of a causal thing and not turn into a elitist things where other players lose interest because they can't win. We don't want perfect player but players who play well enough and know what they are doing.
2012-10-02T20:02:31-0700,"^Exactly- It is important to have members who are active on here, but do not need to be a ""pro"", just need to be able to give a good challenge- not undeaftable. Skilled enough to make a team that is built well with a level of stratgy that is not to competitive, but a challenge if you do not know right off what the team they have is before accepting the challenge. The ""challenge"" part is that you need to work with what you bring, and win with what you have. On both ends of the challenger/E4- work with what is in front of you and with what you have."
2012-10-05T23:46:21-0700,"So... applications for teams and E4 members have closed; I assume there will be a processing period, but any idea when this will all get started?"
2012-10-05T23:52:50-0700,Can't wait to challenge the Elite 4 with probably one of the weirdest teams you would ever see in VGC.
2012-10-06T13:36:28-0700,"This is still a go, just needing replies from those who applied is all. Sorry for a delay, but it is still on track and hopefully soon we'll be good to go."
2012-10-06T17:16:06-0700,Am ready whenever this is a go
2012-09-19T15:36:43-0700,"As a comminty for all things Pokemon, we strive to provide various levels of what we can provide for the members on this site. As a whole, this site is a great community that is based around the TCG. This site has one of the best reputations for providing the TCG Community with the most complete information and discussions around, revolving around the TCG and and related topics that card gamers support and participate in.One of the slow but growing aspects of Pokemon in general is the Video Game competition being incorporated into TCPI events around the nation. The community of players with in the TCG has a small group inside the TCG members that do activly play the video game(s). Either for fun or competition- being a VG'r is still an enjoyable activity along with the TCG or individualy, or both.This is not all about change, this is about addition. A way to branch out and look into ways to imprwhat we can offer to the community. Looking into the Video game side of things, there is potentual to spark interest in new players from those who do play in the Video game to become TCG players. And the same can be said on the other end of the spectrum.How does a site like this branch out to find possible interest in growing the player base for the TCG? Is it impossible to see what and why the Video Game players might bring into the TCG scene?Why does this site even provide anything for the Video Game community?First of all, I will porvide a small amount of personal information to show what my take on this subject is.I have children. I am an active parent who take interest in what my children do. Pokemon became one of those interests. I have played in the TCG since the days of Base set. I am a true RPG Video Gamer, and Pokemon feeds into my gaming hobby. I have been to so many events, I do not even know when about the first time my son and I walked into our local Toys R Us to play the TCG.Physical issues have kept me from being able to be as active as I would like, and sitting down to play a card game at times is brutal on me. The Video Game is not as demanding on me physically, and I can stop at any time, unlike a full day of tournament play for the card game. Thus, my desire to expand a little bit further over the years into what more can I get out of playing the Video Game, and how can I orginize this to have more fun. It started out simple, at an event when I was asked ""Hay, will you battle me?"".From that day onward, it has grown into where we all are at today. Tournaments all around, everywhere, online via Wi-Fi. Even Nintendo has pumped out tournaments. League play, teams, you name- we Video Gamers have something to bring into the community.I am not asking that this site provide more then what is being provided already, nor asking that the staff go out of their way to apply even more focus onto the Video Game side of things. I was asked to assist and bring in what I have to offer for this site based on my history and knowledge of the Video Game. I see potentuel, the unity that can be brought in to include the player base to share a common interest- Pokemon. I do not think that the Video Gamers are asking for too much, but enough recognition that we are all active gamers, and a good amount of us Video Gamers are not just Video Gamers: they are TCG'rs as well. I support both the VGC and the TCG- I just happen to know a greater amount of information I can pass on to those who in the future come onto this site have a resource for all things Pokemon.I know that the title of this thread is what it is: The E4 Project: purpose and Design.I will now discuss that, from the inside view from myself who is in charge of the direction the project is going. I will say that the project is not just all on me, but an awesome group of staff are behind this as well. I will not speak on behalf of those staff members, but the project would not be where it is with out them.In order to combine this site to include the Video Game side of things, we need first consider what there is to offer. Well, the TCG has a lot to offer:How to improve a deckHow to stratagise.Rules, and rule changes.I would include more points, but if your a member of at least two months you can see what there is to offer for the TCG.When you go to a TCG event, you have a lot in your favor to back you up. You have out-side resources, you have family, friends, PTO's, Judges- they are all there to make sure your having a great time. I have been to many events, and i will say that these people put a huge amount of effort into putting a smile on your face, and to know they have a site like this to provide even more for you.So what does all of this have to do with the E4 Project?Interest. A player base. And adding this new field of fun is not easy. it is not a transition, but an inclusion. As a VG mod- my interest is looking into what can be offered on this site to help the two communities merge together, and provide the most I can into supporting this side of things with almost completely same information as the TCG'rs recieve on this site.The main purpose of the E4 is to provide an activity to the Video Gamers who visit or are members here. This site includes on-line TCG options to play, which is a competative alternative to not have to allways leave home to play. This is the idea behind the E4 Project. Have no one to battle? GO-WI-FI!Structure. Orginized. Leadership. Direction. Goals. Objective. Representing. Participation. Rewards. Recognition. All included into this by consideration. We ask no more then what we present, and the intentions behind this project is to mimic the TCG environment as close as possible that integrates the Video game.Design.This was the most discussed portion of the project. Limitations, restrictions, game boundries. Rules. Fairness. Tiers. Structure. Whom should run it, how it should be run. This was the hardest to consider since the games themselves offer so much. It is complicated to look through the eyes of every gamer.It is hard to accomidate to appeas to every gamer to make certain we have a bases for foundation to optimise the best format to use. It was not easy to exclude useable Pokemon.The end result we concluded with did not come easy. But we needed something to try out, to test run a project that we are looking to expand on into a larger system. But trial and error is the only method we have to see what will work with the gamer community. This is not a simple tournament, that is for sure. I did not want to run a simple tournament. I saw potentual in a system that sort of replicates the Video Games. I also wanted to include the members of this site. Participation is one thing, but being active in the actual process of representing could be rewarding on it's own for a good number of people.A challenge.The games themselves have a set out story line, that we wanted to include in our Project. The games have pre-set gyms. That we incorporated into this design. But keeping it a challenge is the hard part. If we allow to much freedom for both the challengers and the E4 representatives, it come across as a tournament but only looking to defeat 4 players over all. It seemed to simple, and not much of a challenge.One of the things us VG mods are doing is to provide skill and stratgies into this site for those who are new (and old) to build upon thier gaming skills. The E4 Project includes that aspect: work with what you have. If you go register a deck at Regionals, are you allowed to switch up your decks? No, thus a part of the mechanics we included to keep it a challenge. We do Pokemon of the Week- a provision to assist gamers at looking to improve their play as well. Now that the VGC is a part of TCG events, we should include equiping those VG'rs with something, and not just left out.The E4 project is an activity that apparently is: (by responce and IMO to it so far)Too soon. This site is not ready.Not enough VG'rs to support this idea.Not structured in favor by the majority of player base.Too confusing.No one knows for sure what is going on.Just something not warrenting enough to even be on this site.Really great idea, just not what was/is expected.No prizes announced as of yet, why bother. (still in the works, since the beginning of all of this)(As a gamer myself, sometimes a prize is just knowing I stomped xxxxx amount of players with my team :thumbWhat ever the reasons, We are not sure of. I thought I would come in here, spill out the beans a bit, and to let you Video Gamers know your not alone, and being supported and offered something to the best we can. I am here to listen, to support, and to assist in growing the TCG scene just the same as all of the TCG staff is in the interest of doing. The TCG staff have taken a big step out to try new things, and I will not let them fail or fall flat on their backs for trying. They listened to us gamers, we need to step it up to show we can provide this community with the tools we have to provide. Another purpose of the E4 project.Over all, I am satisfied with the results so far with the E4 project. I am proud of the site staff whom have work hard on getting this idea as well- with out them, this would not even be at the point it is as right now. Props to them, they deserve recognition for their efforts. Even if it completely flops- it never hurts to try, and it is something to build upon for the future. As long as the games are around- so will I.I encourage anyone to speak their mind on this subject. As a community, we should grow and expand together. I welcome critisizm as well as suggestions as to what more can be done to provide the gaming community with something. Anything.I also tried to bring to the table something a bit out of the norm, trying something I have not seen anywhere else on the web/net. (that I am aware of) Maybe I am a bit way to far out there of the norm to create a project like this. It is still to me a learning experiance, and a way to reach out to the gaming group.Thank you all for your time in reading this, again I ask for your thoughts, your questions, suggestions- you name it- how else can the E4 Project be something (or nothing) that can be an activity on this site?What should change? What should not change? Should this be something on a site such as this? Is the video game community to small right now for this project?"
2012-09-19T16:10:53-0700,"As a part of the staff involved in constructing this event, let me repeat something that was mentioned above; a ton of discussion and planning went into developing this idea.14 pages of discussion went into developing this idea. Each page had an average of 25 posts.That's over 350 posts, from May till now, 4 months... an average of 3 posts per day for 120 consecutive days.This project and the projects connected to it are very much loved creations of the staff working on them. We want to see them grow, evolve, and ultimately provide a fun experience for you, the members of the PokeGym community.I'm not a VG person. I own practically every video game, but I don't play them competitively. I haven't even beat Black/White and will likely buy Black2/White2.Even though I'm not well-educated in the VG environment, I agreed completely when it was suggested to add a VG area to this site. Like Benzo mentioned, the VGC has become as much a part of the entire Pokemon event package as the TCG events. It was time for the PokeGym to catch up with the times.Benzo has been the solid force behind these events, and much kudos should go to him for trying to motivate the creation of more VG elements on this forum. He only thinks of you, the community.I guess the last thing I want to say is that the last thing I, nor any of the staff want to do is exclude certain types of VG players from the events we are trying to run. Just because we may run VG events doesn't mean they will operate like high-end VGC events. Our number one goal is to create a fun environment for the members of the community. Don't let fear of not having adequate Pokemon hold you back from taking part in an event we're trying to run. You never know how you'll do until you try. And you never know if you'll truly enjoy the experience until you try it."
2012-09-19T19:03:37-0700,So what you're saying is...it's postponed?
2012-09-19T23:36:05-0700,"Nope- not postponed at all. It is still in full effect, I am looking to get some early feedback is all.I am the type of person, that the only way this would get postponed is if somehow, the Pokegym just stopped existing..."
2012-09-19T23:51:23-0700,"Ah. I was mislead by this section.I thought you were listing reasons for postponing it =pEither way, Its nice to see some support heading towards the pokegym battles. Its unfortunate they've been a bit of a flop. I'd like to see some motivation to play pokegym battles on the tcg side of things, but that's a different topic.I look for forward to participating!"
2012-09-20T10:59:55-0700,"Dear members of the Pokegym VGC Community - Staff and Players alike.Two years ago or so, I was playing Pokemon TCG with many friends here. I came to watch for strategies, discuss new decks and cards, and participate in the community events and discussion. It was something of a home for me. But it wasn't quite what I wanted.Rogue_Archetype either created or joined (can't remember which) a discussion about community. It's only slightly related, so I'll try to be quick, but to summarize - I completely didn't understand his point of view, which in turn represented the mentality of the Pokegym. I believed that the Gym needed to evolve to suit the players and members that were participating there. And R_A didn't disagree - but he felt that there was an inner vision that needed to be preserved.I don't know what really changed, but between now and then, I came to understand what that inner vision represented. Now I really appreciate it, and this site, much more than I once did.When it comes to the video game community, we have one massive rival. The name is censored here, but I don't think I need to spell it out; the ones who know, know. I will call them the Experts - because that's really what they are. With unrivaled community, loyalty, and understanding of the metagame, theydefineSingles gameplay. They determine thetiers. They determine therules. Andfollows those tiers and rules. If you hop on Wifi to play someone in a Singles match, the odds are, they're playing by the Experts' rules and tiers, and often, using sets defined in the Experts' analyses, as well.But the Experts don't have something that we do:The Experts have been offered some truly amazing opportunities to host official events for other companies, to join forces with big names and really become an integral part of the video game world. But they haven't. They exclude themselves, confident and comfortable in what they have built. But it has weaknesses, and one of those weaknesses is the reason we don't allow reference to their site, no matter how incredible of a resource it is to any VG player: they are lax and vulgar. I've lurked their forums many times. It's a nice enough place, honestly, but... well, I mean, I just looked now, and there's a thread OPENLY DISCUSSING DRUGS.don't mind, but clearly, that kind of thing can't be allowed in a space where children are allowed to view, post, discuss, and learn.That is the strength we have, that the Experts do not, and likely never will.We are allies to the parents, the children, that drive Pokemon onwards. We can offer something to a community that the Experts can never touch.This is the inner vision that R_A was going for, I think:we represent a higher standard of professionalism and openness. By being stricter about our content and its suitability for children, we reach a larger audience of Pokemon players, rather than a more specific one.This is what we need to use to our advantage.The Experts are a place for those who already understand Pokemon tosharpen their understanding.With quality analyses of Pokemon-by-Pokemon statistics, movesets, and comparisons, as well as pages and pages of full-team ratings and critiques, the sheer amount of high-level discussion is unmatched.They define competitive and casual play.That's their niche - they provide a place to play and to practice. But they don't really provide a place to learn.We can,and should, strive to provide a family-friendly playing environment.That's something we can offer that the Experts cannot.We can,and should,provide resources for players that are not interested in hacking, cheating, or otherwise illegitimately obtaining their Pokemon.That's something else that we can offer - and even be excited about - that the Experts cannot.But most importantly,we should focus on providing a place for the absolute beginner to get their start.The Elite 4 does not provide for this goal. It accomplishes some other very important things, and I feel that the Elite 4 is definitely a strong move. Maybe even the best one the Gym could take right now. But if you were to ask me what it lacked, this is definitely what I would tell you:Competitive Pokemon is an overwhelming cascade of information, matchups, and options. It's what makes it so daunting for me to switch to VGC,Imagine someone with little knowledge of either! (That's mostly for my benefit, as I understand it there are many people who are in that position, or know others who are. ^ ^"")This leaves several important questions that need to be answered before we can really continue.I don't know what has been discussed already, but from where I stand watching the Elite 4 program get its start, I have many questions and few answers.I've only learned as much as I have because I've had the chance to practice on simulators. The problem, of course, is that these simulators - much like the Experts' site - cannot be trusted to be PG. But it isn't out of the question for the Pokegym to create a Pokemon Online, Shoddy, or maybe even a Showdown server - once that actually starts being a thing - where we can practice without having to go to the effort of meticulously raising our Pokemon first, only to find that they are flops.We've already discussed a lot of Singles RMTs - I've tried to bring some high-level discussion to the Gym, and the data I've collected have been useful - but I see very little Doubles discussion, even though that's what the Gym seems to be more interested in, and what I sincerely would like to learn more about.How can we promote this format?For those who might not know, 'the Experts' balance competitive Singles play very,verycarefully. They have a long, drawn-out process for testing the power levels of individual Pokemon that seem too strong for 'standard' play, and they use statistics from simulators to determine what belongs at what level - from standard, to sub-standard, to sub-sub-standard... and so forth. This allows a player to use whatever Pokemon he likes in their home environment where they have a chance to shine.Will the Pokegym try to replicate this system? Do they have something else in mind? Will they do something similar to tiering for Doubles (which I think would be amazing)?This is our opportunity to open the doors to younger players who don't know how to raise their Pokemon like the pros - what about a no-EVs format? A no-TMs format? A no-breeding format? Okay, maybe that last one is a bit much... but really! This is where we really open the doors to players that are too intimidated by the Experts. Play at your level of comfort. Play, even!One last thing.Benzo stated this list in his post.It's a list of things the TCG 'offers' its players, in terms of discussion and interest.How doesn't the VG provide every one of these things?These are thingsWEcan make. We can cater them to our needs, desires, and most importantly, our users.The VG community on the Gym, right now, is very small. Our greatest weakness is really that there isn't much interest or discussion, and it's hard to know where to go with such a small beginning. But we know what kind of people weto attract. And between Benzo, Vaporeon, and - if I may be so bold- myself, you have a lot of very knowledgeable and motivated people to draw ideas and energy from, and will do what they can to make this project the best it can be....I'm going to go build a doubles team now."
2012-09-20T11:39:15-0700,"As a player very inexperienced with the video games competitively, I agree with these sentiments. I was considering entering this E4 thing, but seeing how I had no idea how hard it would be (Where it would fit in a scale where easy is the in game story and hard being actual competitive event), I thought against it."
2012-09-20T14:50:41-0700,"You bring alot of good points, Kayle. Thank you for speaking up. That is what is needed in this department.I will address some of your points in a bit later- (you know, read, re-read to make sure I get spot on read of all your post contains to reply proporly is all)I will say this- reaching out to test the waters without a solid level of where to begin to meet the majority is tough. Too easy, and people turn away. Too complicated, same result. Thus, finding that happy medium is the goal. Without knowing exactly where the community stands, why they stand, and how they want to stand is trial and error on my part to give a foot hold to make a standing zone where all is welcome is tough. Thus, my desire to build upon. And accomplishable, with group effort.One other thing: We are looking to build up to a larger scale system. That system will be easier to accomidate everyone better. This project is a total test run, we needed a start, we need feed back, and we need to see how large of a crowd we have right now. Making this project a perminent activity on here is an option, but this idea has been scaled down at least 60% from my original idea.Yes, the VG area is on the quite side of things on here, but I am glad to see more voices speaking up. The voice will get louder, it will take time is all. My intent is to draw out those voices to be heard, and to build up as a group to put more into the community."
2012-09-21T20:54:30-0700,"Tons of good points Kayle.I will speak for myself and only myself.If I were to develop a system for the PokeGym, I would base it on the official VG format, and leave it at that. No tiers, no special rules, whatever other toppings that other people put on their pizza aren't put on the traditional VG pizza. I feel, anything that creates a different playing experience than what would be experienced at a VG event isn't worth investing time into. What use does it come in if all you do singles play but all the VGC events are double battles?Also, I would frown upon any artificial system to ""play"" the game. Yes, it's lame to invest all the time to get a Pokemon to whatever level with whatever ability, skills, item attached, etc, and then find out he's not amazing, but on the opposite side of that, it requires very little time and effort to change a few drop down menu options and have a level 50 charizard with the perfect skills, ability, item attached, etc. In the end, at least with the first option, you have a probably semi-decent Pokemon that can still be modified (attacks and item) some, while with the other system, you eventually have to go out and do the massive breeding/EV training/IV egg hatching dance to get that ""perfect"" Pokemon.And, this forum is so connected to the official game, that any promoting of software used to provide a similar service as the actual video games should be frowned upon. Yes, the forum has a section for online tcg programs, so perhaps this point is moot, but I still feel a little dirty promoting people to use an outside software to learn about the game instead of actually playing the game.I think you're absolutely right Kayle that the PokeGym needs to figure out a way to appeal to those who are interested but don't know where to start. I think Trainer's Choice article series helps some with that, but it's still probably a little over the head of brand new players.I'm definitely a VG noob, if there ever could be one. So, I can understand where people are coming from. The whole ordeal seems really daunting to me. Perhaps I can use my lack of experience to better understand how to appeal to this crowd.Again speaking for myself, but I'm really impressed with your post, and I think it'd be great if we could get you on our staff team. I think your passion would definitely improve the quality of VG products providing on this forum."
2012-09-21T23:55:31-0700,"As a new comer the competitive vgc this year, i found pokemon online to be critical to my extremely fast learning curve.Its a downloadable client and the team making process is every user friendly....I'd say its probably easier to use than playtcg.I think it'd be a shame to exclude the program from ""official pokegym events"""
2012-09-22T00:36:56-0700,"ahhhh- the days of starting out, and look where we are today.From what I see, from when I became a member (sheesh, I would be a longer timer member on here if I was aware that this site existed back in the day)- we have a growth, an expansion, and a small VG community that is in a time of acceptance and merging.It is one thing to go onto a site and use a Program to pre test a team and the what not-But a true gamer will always triumph with a win that was worked for. Regardless.That is what other sites are for, that sort of stuff. I am not against people doing it, for it is out there. I do not promote it, nor do I look down upon it. But, like I said- this gamer is true to the spirit, and my work has paid off and is truelly satisfying. Without a real challenge, it is not something to improve upon, nor a way to have to look around to find the easy route.Adding onto this site to include the VGC is not as easy as it looks, but at least there is a staff community that is willing to work togather with us VG'rs. They have given the chance, we stepped up. Now we are on the task of looking into what can and what can not be, and what should and what shouldn't change.I encourage the VG community to keep speaking, we are listening. We may not agree with every aspect or point of view- but we are tossing out what we think is hopefully an interest to the VG'rs in a fun way.Work with us, we work with you. We may have limits, but limits with reason. The VG members are free to choose to participate or not, we offer what we have is all. And so far, I believe we are off to a sweet start with everything up to this point. Us gamers need to toss around the discussions is all, and we will see what we can do (and what we can not do)-"
2012-09-22T06:03:09-0700,"If it's gaining new participation from members who don't regularly play the vgc, limiting them to using their physical team against people who have a completely ev / iv developed team would be a good way to get them discouraged pretty quickly.How long does it take to EV train and IV bread a team? 20-30 hours? If you are maybe thinking of joining this tournament that twenty hour barrier is a huge motivation block."
2012-09-22T07:09:36-0700,"Physical team means their actual Pokemon in the video game, is that correct?Who is assuming that the Elite 4 members have completely ev/iv developed Pokemon? We were letting members of the community become one of the elite 4, so it's not like we've specifically picked the best four players in the nation to compete again; these people are just like you and me, and they will have Pokemon like you and me. Good pokemon, I would bet, but I wouldn't assume the ""best"" pokemon.I think it is important to compete in the physical (cartridge) game. Learn about the game wherever you want, try out ideas in 'simulators', but ultimately come back to the actual game and implement and battle. What is the point of playing the video game if you're not actually playing on the cartridge? That would be like letting TCG players compete at Cities/Regionals/Worlds over Apprentice or Redshark.Shouldn't it be fun to try, just so you can say you tried? When did it become the standard policy to not try something that doesn't look easily accomplished?I understand we may be talking about young teens - adults, and that the Elite 4 event may not be the best event for the newer player, but even newer players have to get their feet wet sometime and there will be losses along the way."
2012-09-22T23:09:16-0700,"Prime, I'm a little rushed and tired at the moment, but I'll respond to what I can/what I feel is most important.Let's agree to disagree about simulators. If the Staff and the Gym overall want to restrict gameplay to hard cartridges, I totally understand and respect that. All I can say is that I would know only a fraction of what I know about competitive Pokemon - and would possess a proportionately reduced drive to teach others to play - if I had not been introduced to Pokemon Showdown. It's an invaluable resource to people without the time or the investment to really try to build a serious team, but who are curious enough to be roped in gently. I understand that people really love building teams and breeding/training their own Pokemon (heck, my gf only played for that - she had no desire to actually BATTLE them, she just liked HAVING them), and I don't mind that aspect myself, but it's frustrating to try to actually build something serious, and just hope it 'works' without prior testing.Imagine breeding hours and hours for a hidden power, only to realize that you should've gotten a DIFFERENT hidden power, because the one you have isn't relevant. (Or maybe you make a change in your team that makes it irrelevant.) Really, hidden power in general is just a joke in the games itself, but hopefully it gets my point across.To be fair, regarding the Elite 4, I automatically assumed that the Elite 4 - while they'd be rotated around some - would be skilled players. In fact, I'd be disappointed to bring my basic Singles knowledge, build a Doubles team, and find that my elite 4 opponent knows about as much about doubles as I do (if not less, even). Perhaps I'm in the minority, or not the target audience. All I can tell you is what I personally see and experience.Promoting a Wifi league is definitely the best way to introduce players IMO. I got kind of excited about the idea of ""building blocks"" formats, where players can bring teams to their comfort level of training/testing/experience and expect to be paired against opponents of similar nature, but I'm not so clear on the implementation or enforcement of that."
2012-09-23T06:40:59-0700,"I don't see a problem with learning new pokemon combinations in a simulator, but it should all find its way back to the cartridge.Someone can be the best online simulator player in the world, but when a VGC comes around, they'll have to bow out because they won't have the actual Pokemon on their cartridges.Yes, it does take a whole lot of the time out of testing new ideas, and I guess that is a huge appeal, but we can't promote using the simulators for everyday use, idea crafting, testing, and battling. That eliminates that actual game from the equation. Pretty much the simulators steal money from Nintendo because players don't have to play the actual game to actually play the game.Like I said earlier, I'm fine with TCG players learning how to play competitively over Redshark, but ultimately they have to buy the actual cards and build the actual deck to take to the tournament. That is how it should work in the VG, too, in my opinion, where ultimately each player should have to get those Pokemon in the actual game."
2012-09-23T09:20:53-0700,"I think you're taking this metaphor a little to far. I'm not suggesting at all that sanctioned tournaments allow players to use simulators.The point I was trying to make is: if you're running this tournament as a means of attracting new interest, it'd be best done by opening it to the biggest market. Limiting players to catridges will lower overall participation from those who don't already participate."
2012-09-23T12:58:31-0700,"Methinks maybe you're missing the point. If you're the best simulator player in the world, you are the best Pokemon player in the world. There is no difference (the simulators replicate every part of the game, including evasion/critical hits that many hardcore Singles players hate) except that you don't necessarily have to spend the hours to build your own team. If the player in question wished to participate in a VGC, of course, they should need to spend all of the time and energy to create their actual team on a cartridge, but they will have the benefit of knowing what they want to create before they actually create it. That may not be an unfair advantage, but it's certainly nice!Other than this I pretty much completely agree with you, so there we go.@Backwards (didn't feel like trying to spell it...), I have some ideas already for how to circumvent the difficulty of playing/building on cartridges. What if you could have some PokeGymmers who just liked building/training Pokemon make bits of your team for you? You could earn better/more complex/rarer Pokemon through playing in the league. Juts a singular idea, but one I like."
2012-09-23T15:36:39-0700,"When TCPI has an event that sports the VGC, there are no simulators that are provided at the event for people to use. Now, it could be countered to say that online and sites- yes, an advantage for the possible use of a simulator.The main factor in using actual physical cartridges is that you can not transfer the Pokemon onto a cartridge without a lot of gimmicks to get your game cartridge to be as legit as legit can be. Sure, you can program away, and do what ever to your game- but if it does not come in as legit by any means, your not looked at as a person who did the real hard actual work that is involved to reward your efforts.I can see the design behind simulators, and it is something to look into. We can look into it all we want, discuss it until we have some sort of idea, then put some action behind the idea- make a proposal. But it will not hold much of an ounce of consideration right away.Look at the nice incline of interest and support for the VG has right now. Is it super huge, and we are the #1 site for VGC? No. Could we be #1 someday? Possible. It is a goal to aim for. I do not think that a simulator style option is something that is going to be a quick and simple ""yes"", but it is not going to be brushed aside discussion wise.We need to take steps, small ones. It takes time, planning, and a great deal of things are simply out of our hands as it is. Personally, most of the staff on here I know are all good willed people who are reasonable. But with in the reason, there is a point the ""No"" is for well thought out reasons as to why a ""No"" is given. I can not and will not speak on behalf of them, but it is a unity of effort to find what can be offered on this site with heavy consideration.As the VG scene grows and advances on this site, we need more then just staff and a community of members. We need to have resources to assist in providing things in order for ideas to work.Having the easy access of game cartridges is so far the best and most open option to work with. Seriously, in this day and age with electronics and what it can do and how often it changes, we should first look into what is consistant and reliable the most.I am not for or against simulators being on here. I do not know enough about them for 1, 2: I do not know this site and the programming at all as to what works and what does not, 3: I am a mod with the simple desire to be a midway point to keep the site busy and clean while up-holding the best interest of everyone to have a happy medium.Using cartridges is IMO the best open option to start things out with. People show up at TCPI events with their cartridges, at least from my point of view it demonstrates that they put effort into bringing their ""work"" with them, and to show they have the skill to win with what they have to work with.I believe a good number of players are to bent on ""flawless"" Pokemon, regardless of how obtained. Trust me- I have wins under my belt through pure skill. Regardless of ""flawless"" Pokemon. If the game was in so much favor of ""flawless"" Pokemon, there really is no reason for hidden/random mechanics built in like critical hits, or, ""This team is flawless, so ignore sandstorm damage"" type of factors. Even the best mis-play and lose, and they had RNG'd Pokemon.The amount of hype that ""flawless"" Pokemon has IMO is fine for the people who do it, but it does not weigh in much as far as skill, or the ability to know how to run a team. It is cool and all to be proud to have a ""flawless"" Pokemon, it does show your intellect level and skill to know and understand programming, sure it ""save's time"" and all- but really it boils down to skill, some luck, and you can not prpare for everything in battles.Keep in mind that nothing discussed is a garuntee, or that it is an absolute ""No/Yes"" deal. Who knows what the future has in store."
2012-09-23T17:57:38-0700,"If someone who only uses simulators declares themselves the best Pokemon player in the world, I will show up on their doorstep with my DSiXL and ask them to prove it. Because, ultimately, that's the only way to do it.Yes, it simulates everything from the video games, but it isn't a replacement for the video games. I feel too many people think it is a replacement, and that they never need to purchase the physical cartridges. This is a slap in the face of Nintendo, the creators of the game that the simulators copy, and in my honest opinion, lazy of them.They don't want to put the time into breeding, etc, to get the best Pokemon. They want to use some drop down menus, input a few numbers, and presto the perfect Blaziken. How can someone feel proud of themselves doing this?I understand there are great learning tools out there on the internet, but in my opinion, nothing will take the place of sitting across from another player, with your DS out, and battling over the cartridges.And for someone to suggest I support an event, that is taking place solely over simulators, disgusts me. I will never support that. I can't speak for the other staff on this site."
2012-09-23T18:22:38-0700,"Not allownig people to use simulators for the videogame, is like saying from now on, all TCG competitions in the PokeGym have to be done with actual cards througb Skype and no proxies allowed.Yes Prime, being the best at a simulator IS being the best in the actual videogame, and if you show up at his doorstep for him to prove it, he'll enter a DNS address, download the .pkm files he needs of perfectly LEGIT and RNG'd Pokemon, use vitamins and feather to EV his Pokemon to have the perfect stats, and beat your imperfect IV'd team.Based on these posts, I don't think you guys (Prime/Benzo) have researched enough or are knowledgeable enough of the current VGC state and how people get their Pokemon.RNG manipulation is extremely easy once you learn it, but that initial step, of going through calibration, learning new terms like seeding and having to use Chatter from Chatot a lot WILL confuse people and THAT is the entry barrier here.playtcg.me disgusts you then? You don't think people should boast about their deck being pretty good because how can they be proud they're winning on a simulator?At the end of the day, it's not about 'being proud' or taking 'your work' to an official VGC event and going 0-5. You want the best odds of winning and thus you get perfect IV'd Pokemon, you EV them perfectly, and then use your moves and strategy. IV's and EV's are just boring paperwork, but necessary nonetheless."
2012-09-23T18:57:47-0700,"And they pretty much violate the rules from TCPI by essentially using hacked Pokemon when people download them like that...don't take it the wrong way, we're not blind to how some people get their Pokemon for use (of which discussion is against the rules here), but it's fairly blatant cheating when you're downloading Pokemon like that and you show up to a VGC tournament where they can't detect it unless you're pretty lazy and go over 510 EVs. But that's another issue regardless of battling skills.Anyways, as for simulators themselves, just my thoughts on it I personally don't have issues with them, they're great for practicing and such. However, to me anyways, they fall into a pretty gray area as far as legality is concerned, I mean even if the makers aren't making money or asking for donations, they're still using copyright sprites and such. It's like how the one other TCG sim got shut down for using card images in their program, though the name of that one escapes me. So until that issue gets decided, I'd rather lean on the safe than sorry side and opt for physical carts for now for the purpose of tournaments and such here."
2012-09-23T19:06:43-0700,"These sections of your post are utterly unrelated, and I hope you see how that is the case. From a purely competitive standpoint, playing the simulator is playing Pokemon. But I'd never say that you should play an event with simulators, that you shouldn't care about raising your Pokemon legitimately, that we shouldn't be expected to support Nintendo, or that simulator play is in any way superior or preferable. Thanks, Pablo, for hitting a number of key points in perfection.I actually will take a possibly surprising stance and point out that IVs don't matter THAT much in the long run, especially in the VGC format where they only make half as much a difference. You should check the IVs of the things you breed (my first Scizor had an Attack IV of 2... no good.) but you don'tto go for perfect. I like to. It's fun. I don't want to say that everyone should, however, and I'd like to promote an environment where people don't feel pressured to.This is where I will step away from Pablo. We aren't the mainstream audience of competitive Pokemon players, and that's what makes us different, and gives us some different rules. The Experts play on simulators and hack their Pokemon together (legitimate or not) because raising the Pokemon is something of a waste of time to them. It's not a waste of time to us - it's part of the point.My point would only be that we should be open to players using a simulator to learn to play, and then bring their team to their official cart for official gameplay. I'm really kind of sad/worried to see that Prime misunderstood me so badly as to think I outright disagreed with him, because I don't. I would like to allow and promote discussion of simulators as learning tools... but I wouldn't push to use them as a competitive medium.I hope I'm making more sense. =\"
2012-09-23T20:08:44-0700,"I just view playing sims as the same thing as playing on PlayTCG, Apprentice, or Redshark. They're used for testing purposes. They're used for organizing online tournaments (at least, until TCGO can do that). What's really the difference? Pokegym already uses the three above for their ""official"" online tournaments, why can't they use the sims for their online VG tournaments?"
2012-09-23T20:26:30-0700,"@Pablo- You under estimate the knowladge I have about the games, and the mechanics. My research is extensive, not 100% thurough to the point that I can do the stuff second hand nature- but I know quite a bit more then you would think. I see your stand point, and your entitled to it. Your welcomed to discuss further, but please keep in mind that it does not mean that since a point of view is in disagreement on something that it does not validate the knowledge of a person on a subject.I have no problems with battling a person with a perfect team- I still win 80% of all of my battles. And I have stomped flawless teams, left and right, and I could do it all day with a 80% consistancy rate. It is in my opinion that a person can not win 100% of the time consistantly with a flawless team. I know the RNG mechanics, I know the process, I know of the programs out there- and believe me- every single one of those programs/simulaters is even 100% garunteed win success rate for the player.Hmmmmm- example- a 100% flawless rain dance Politoad and Kindra team, along with Starmie and Cressalia- 100% loss to my one Shedinja. Yup. Simulate that predictable outcome, sure- but in real life the win was worth a compliment from an opponant who knows you can not prepair for everything, and knows that my Shedinja was not flawless, just ev'd in speed and attack.I may not know every aspect of the simulator scene as a whole, but the design and uses behind them are something of consideration. All I ask is that you bring a legit team to the battle, and have the skills to show that you did not take the lazy route to present your game."
2012-09-23T21:23:30-0700,"Kayle I think your knowledge is a little outdated. Benzo, I think your aims are a little lofty right now. Here's my thoughts on what I've read so far:1. The site you're all referring to stopped being the goto site for VGC and is fairly irrelevant in the VG Modified format now. The staff who used to do that part of the work decided to start up a new site for many of the reasons you mentioned. It's focused on creating an artificial metagame and filled with content we really don't want to have to explain to parents or children who we actually have to face and talk to at events.2. Simulators are a perfectly fine way of testing a team just like PlayTCG, Pokemon TCG Online, or Redshark. Opening a pack has no effect on your playing skill and neither does breeding (although some of our best breeders are in fact our best battlers!).3. You need to accept the Gym for what it is. You will not be the #1 website. There is already a giant VGC community that has been growing for the past many years. What your goal should be, is the same as it is for TCG on Nugget Bridge. You can see ourforum layout here. Use your Video Game forum to introduce TCG players to the video game in an environment they're comfortable with and players they know. Point them to these other resources they have available.For example, Nugget Bridge does not publish TCG articles. It's not because we don't like the TCG. It's because we understand our focus. We discuss the TCG because we like it and we want to talk to others in the community about it, but we have accounts on sites like PokeGym, SixPrizes, TheTopCut, and another site I think might be censored here as well. We point to these places for resources. The Gym is the best site for competitive TCG news. SixPrizes has the most in-depth articles (regardless of what you think about the site). TheTopCut features the best media coverage you'll get.I think the Gym can provide a valuable service to TCG players trying to get into the video game, but not the way it's currently laid out."
2012-09-23T22:00:42-0700,"That is 100% NOT true. These downloaded .pkm files are simply the data you generated in the game, transferred into another format.I would give you link examples, but the site is not allowed on here. There are several dedicated members to providing Pokemon to whomever is attending a Regionals. Flawless, 100% LEGIT bred Pokemon, no meddling with Action Replay or anything of the sort. These dedicated players are making their Pokemon available either by trading them to you, or uploading the .pkm data files to make the process go by far faster. All you do by choosing the .pkm files route is skipping the part where you BOTH have to be online at the same time for a trade. Seems pretty efficient and logical to me.No one is generating Pokemon out of the blue and taking them to the VGC. Everyone is manipulating the RNG (which is quite easy in BW version for both breeding and catching exactly whatever you want) and getting their nice Level 1 Pokemon from eggs, feeding them vitamins and then attaching items and giving them PokeRus to get them to where they want them to be. EVERYTHING completely LEGAL, no cheating whatsoever. I've done it myself PLENTY of times, getting me a flawless Terrakion and Victini, but once I saw people's generosity in providing participants free Pokemon to use, I stopped doing that and started trading, purely out of laziness.I don't understand the sentence I bolded.Regarding your example: Not only is ONE battle not good enough to prove anything, the current rules allow for teams to be previewed. So if your opponent did not bring a Pokemon or two to counter Shedinja just means he's bad, regardless if he was using a perfect team or his starter Pokemon that he chose.Secondly, the 'design and uses' behind the simulators are exactly the same as those of playtcg, PTCGO, apprentice, redshark, etc. Are you going to tell me you've NEVER used those or you don't approve using those, and the only way you'll test is using real cards because otherwise you can't prepare for everything?"
2012-09-23T22:20:17-0700,"Guys, I really don't think this discussion about simulators or downloaded Pokemon is going anywhere. There's a lot of merit to both sides of the downloading discussion, but the simple fact right now is that the Gym has to take an anti-cheating and anti-flash-cart stance because of its connections and political position. We're not in a position to debate it. Simulators can be discussed later."
2012-09-23T22:25:12-0700,"I doubt going to a faux GTS (if this is the one I'm thinking of) and downloading Pokemon really counts as not cheating...and last I checked, I'm fairly certain that TCPI would probably frown big time on people uploading and downloading Pokemon files into their game for use or others to use. Obviously RNG is another issue, but something like downloading .pkm files into your game is probably crossing a line somewhere, even if the people running this stuff have no way of catching it. I mean, at face value it's probably just a more efficient way of cloning, but still.So anyways, nothing more about that topic like Kayle said :thumb:"
2012-09-23T22:40:18-0700,"It's exactly the same as trading. I can't even see how it is an issue or it is frowned upon and cannot be talked about, and I believe this exact stance on things is why VGC will not take off in this forums. NuggetBridge is to the 21st century what Pokegym is to the medieval ages with this stance on VGC IMO. And since the 3x World Champion RNG's his Pokemon along with every single other Worlds competitor at least, receiving a .pkm file over going to the WiFi center to trade with another person is neither cheating nor should it be frowned upon.Just MO."
2012-09-23T23:03:22-0700,"I do think the simulator conversation is needing to halt. I can lock this thread- I do not want to do so. Having a discussion is one thing, debating is another even if valid points are in favor on both sides of the deal. I will leave it at this:If an offical program is created to allow us VG'rs a simulator program to use, I will promote it. Until then, Pablo and Kayle- good points, let's wait until some time in the future to see what becomes available to us VG'rs and go from there.Again- good points, yet we need to see what other options are open for us VG'rs on here and work with what we have to use.Cool?So, the E4-What about tournaments? any sort of tournament would be good. Single, or doubles. The design behind the E4 is to mimic the actual games, but with some web/net interaction with out having to be physically at a location or event.With what the games offer, there are plenty of things that can be brought up to create some sort of battle activity that everyone can gain something from.These are the ideas I am looking for, ideas that can become a possibility then into action with an end result that is involving the on-line/wi-fi community.So, suggestions on changes to the E4 is welcome, or any other ideas that could be generated into just adding more into this area of the site.Last little note: With simple respect, Kayle and Pablo, the heat is off for the simulator subject for the time being. It has been recognized, and with the respect it is something that may some day see the light on here. Until then, let's look for other options for what can become something that adds into the VG side of things."
2012-09-24T05:43:58-0700,"Perhaps instead of allowing applications to be an Elite 4 member, there could be a competition, with the top 4 becoming Elite 4 members. This way, people know who each member is, probably even faced one or two of them previously. They don't seem so scary, so intimidating; they are just another fellow member, but a skilled trainer none-the-less."
2012-09-27T14:27:10-0700,"I think we should proceed as planned, since as of right now there is not much time to formulate and prep for a tournament. I have faith that we have a decent start- and we could possibly look into the options of having a tournament to decide who should represent. It is the plan to gather input, responce, and inter action with the members on here.This thread will stay open for now, to allow more input to roll in to see if and what could change for the E4 project. But it is important that we follow through with the design at this time, and see how things go.I still welcome input and ideas, so please feel free to chip in suggestions everyone."
2012-10-02T16:58:50-0700,Thats what I was thinking but decided against it because we want it to be more of a causal thing and not turn into a elitist things where other players lose interest because they can't win. We don't want perfect player but players who play well enough and know what they are doing.
2012-10-02T20:02:31-0700,"^Exactly- It is important to have members who are active on here, but do not need to be a ""pro"", just need to be able to give a good challenge- not undeaftable. Skilled enough to make a team that is built well with a level of stratgy that is not to competitive, but a challenge if you do not know right off what the team they have is before accepting the challenge. The ""challenge"" part is that you need to work with what you bring, and win with what you have. On both ends of the challenger/E4- work with what is in front of you and with what you have."
2012-10-05T23:46:21-0700,"So... applications for teams and E4 members have closed; I assume there will be a processing period, but any idea when this will all get started?"

Thanks, Pablo, for hitting a number of key points in perfection.I actually will take a possibly surprising stance and point out that IVs don't matter THAT much in the long run, especially in the VGC format where they only make half as much a difference. You should check the IVs of the things you breed (my first Scizor had an Attack IV of 2... no good.) but you don'tto go for perfect. I like to. It's fun. I don't want to say that everyone should, however, and I'd like to promote an environment where people don't feel pressured to.This is where I will step away from Pablo. We aren't the mainstream audience of competitive Pokemon players, and that's what makes us different, and gives us some different rules. The Experts play on simulators and hack their Pokemon together (legitimate or not) because raising the Pokemon is something of a waste of time to them. It's not a waste of time to us - it's part of the point.My point would only be that we should be open to players using a simulator to learn to play, and then bring their team to their official cart for official gameplay. I'm really kind of sad/worried to see that Prime misunderstood me so badly as to think I outright disagreed with him, because I don't. I would like to allow and promote discussion of simulators as learning tools... but I wouldn't push to use them as a competitive medium.I hope I'm making more sense. =\"

Your welcomed to discuss further, but please keep in mind that it does not mean that since a point of view is in disagreement on something that it does not validate the knowledge of a person on a subject.I have no problems with battling a person with a perfect team- I still win 80% of all of my battles. And I have stomped flawless teams, left and right, and I could do it all day with a 80% consistancy rate. It is in my opinion that a person can not win 100% of the time consistantly with a flawless team.

Yup. Simulate that predictable outcome, sure- but in real life the win was worth a compliment from an opponant who knows you can not prepair for everything, and knows that my Shedinja was not flawless, just ev'd in speed and attack.I may not know every aspect of the simulator scene as a whole, but the design and uses behind them are something of consideration.

The site you're all referring to stopped being the goto site for VGC and is fairly irrelevant in the VG Modified format now. The staff who used to do that part of the work decided to start up a new site for many of the reasons you mentioned. It's focused on creating an artificial metagame and filled with content we really don't want to have to explain to parents or children who we actually have to face and talk to at events.2. Simulators are a perfectly fine way of testing a team just like PlayTCG, Pokemon TCG Online, or Redshark. Opening a pack has no effect on your playing skill and neither does breeding (although some of our best breeders are in fact our best battlers!).3. You need to accept the Gym for what it is. You will not be the #1 website. There is already a giant VGC community that has been growing for the past many years. What your goal should be, is the same as it is for TCG on Nugget Bridge. You can see ourforum layout here. Use your Video Game forum to introduce TCG players to the video game in an environment they're comfortable with and players they know. Point them to these other resources they have available.For example, Nugget Bridge does not publish TCG articles. It's not because we don't like the TCG. It's because we understand our focus. We discuss the TCG because we like it and we want to talk to others in the community about it, but we have accounts on sites like PokeGym, SixPrizes, TheTopCut, and another site I think might be censored here as well. We point to these places for resources. The Gym is the best site for competitive TCG news. SixPrizes has the most in-depth articles (regardless of what you think about the site). TheTopCut features the best media coverage you'll get.I think the Gym can provide a valuable service to TCG players trying to get into the video game, but not the way it's currently laid out."

There are several dedicated members to providing Pokemon to whomever is attending a Regionals. Flawless, 100% LEGIT bred Pokemon, no meddling with Action Replay or anything of the sort. These dedicated players are making their Pokemon available either by trading them to you, or uploading the .pkm data files to make the process go by far faster. All you do by choosing the .pkm files route is skipping the part where you BOTH have to be online at the same time for a trade. Seems pretty efficient and logical to me.No one is generating Pokemon out of the blue and taking them to the VGC. Everyone is manipulating the RNG (which is quite easy in BW version for both breeding and catching exactly whatever you want) and getting their nice Level 1 Pokemon from eggs, feeding them vitamins and then attaching items and giving them PokeRus to get them to where they want them to be. EVERYTHING completely LEGAL, no cheating whatsoever. I've done it myself PLENTY of times, getting me a flawless Terrakion and Victini, but once I saw people's generosity in providing participants free Pokemon to use, I stopped doing that and started trading, purely out of laziness.I don't understand the sentence I bolded.Regarding your example: Not only is ONE battle not good enough to prove anything, the current rules allow for teams to be previewed. So if your opponent did not bring a Pokemon or two to counter Shedinja just means he's bad, regardless if he was using a perfect team or his starter Pokemon that he chose.Secondly, the 'design and uses' behind the simulators are exactly the same as those of playtcg, PTCGO, apprentice, redshark, etc. Are you going to tell me you've NEVER used those or you don't approve using those, and the only way you'll test is using real cards because otherwise you can't prepare for everything?"
2012-09-23T22:20:17-0700,"Guys, I really don't think this discussion about simulators or downloaded Pokemon is going anywhere. There's a lot of merit to both sides of the downloading discussion, but the simple fact right now is that the Gym has to take an anti-cheating and anti-flash-cart stance because of its connections and political position. We're not in a position to debate it. Simulators can be discussed later."

Obviously RNG is another issue, but something like downloading .pkm files into your game is probably crossing a line somewhere, even if the people running this stuff have no way of catching it.

Skilled enough to make a team that is built well with a level of stratgy that is not to competitive, but a challenge if you do not know right off what the team they have is before accepting the challenge. The ""challenge"" part is that you need to work with what you bring, and win with what you have. On both ends of the challenger/E4- work with what is in front of you and with what you have."

But that's another issue regardless of battling skills.Anyways, as for simulators themselves, just my thoughts on it I personally don't have issues with them, they're great for practicing and such. However, to me anyways, they fall into a pretty gray area as far as legality is concerned, I mean even if the makers aren't making money or asking for donations, they're still using copyright sprites and such. It's like how the one other TCG sim got shut down for using card images in their program, though the name of that one escapes me.

2012-10-03T03:15:19-0700,"I was just thinking about it and other may have noticed it but did not connect the dots. I always though Missingno was a bird because of all the flying type moves it had. I believe it had Sky Attack twice, Water gun and Recover.The reason I say that is in the first or second episode of season 1 Pokemon, Ash did see a Ho-Oh fly above him over a rainbow. This was before any indication of a second generation of Pokemon. People have also said Missingno could have been one of the Legendary bird Pokemon of Gen 1 next to Articuno, Moltres and Zapdos but stronger but was later removed. I think it was done to prevent 2 Legendary Pokemon of the same typing from being in the game or to prevent favoritism over Moltres.Thats just my theory I though I'd share with everyone. I always wanted to know why that bird Ash saw was never in the game. That may be the case."
2012-10-03T04:26:14-0700,There's a Missingno in every game. It's just a bit of nonexistent data. That's about it.
2012-10-03T08:41:53-0700,"Well, yeah, if we want to get technical, Missingno (and all other glitchmon) are just assortments of unrelated data from the rest of the game, cramped into a Pokemon template and made to fight.I went through and read up on how the whole thing works at one point. It was pretty cool to see as a prospective game designer/programmer how the very first systems and games were programmed."

2012-10-04T18:05:32-0700,"I'm still convinced that the Mew glitch is not a glitch at all. I believe quite firmly that it was intentionally coded into the game, sort of a joke to the original coders. The reason for that? Basically every Pokemon in the game can be caught by the same method."
2012-10-04T18:38:37-0700,"The reason you can catch every Pokemon by that method (virtually) is because you can set it up to work for virtually every possible Special stat. The Special stat of the last Pokemon you encounter before actually using the glitch is used to look up the Pokemon table for which Pokemon you actually find; that one Slowpoke has the correct stat for Mew, but there are a couple others. This is how you catch most glitchmon, Trainermon, and other bizarre occurrences.I really doubt it was ""intentionally coded"" into the game. But it's a lot of fun either way. Maybe they left it in there even after they found it."

It's also worth noting a similar glitch can be used to get Celebi in GS, though in this case it's tied to index number (in this case, with the move Beat Up, which shares with Celebi #251) instead of Pokemon table."
2012-10-03T03:15:19-0700,"I was just thinking about it and other may have noticed it but did not connect the dots. I always though Missingno was a bird because of all the flying type moves it had. I believe it had Sky Attack twice, Water gun and Recover.The reason I say that is in the first or second episode of season 1 Pokemon, Ash did see a Ho-Oh fly above him over a rainbow. This was before any indication of a second generation of Pokemon. People have also said Missingno could have been one of the Legendary bird Pokemon of Gen 1 next to Articuno, Moltres and Zapdos but stronger but was later removed. I think it was done to prevent 2 Legendary Pokemon of the same typing from being in the game or to prevent favoritism over Moltres.Thats just my theory I though I'd share with everyone. I always wanted to know why that bird Ash saw was never in the game. That may be the case."
2012-10-03T04:26:14-0700,There's a Missingno in every game. It's just a bit of nonexistent data. That's about it.
2012-10-03T08:41:53-0700,"Well, yeah, if we want to get technical, Missingno (and all other glitchmon) are just assortments of unrelated data from the rest of the game, cramped into a Pokemon template and made to fight.I went through and read up on how the whole thing works at one point. It was pretty cool to see as a prospective game designer/programmer how the very first systems and games were programmed."

2012-09-01T16:31:49-0700,"Why do you want to be a part of the Elite 4?- I want to join the Elite 4 to further spread the influence of Pokemon VGC and the interesting formats that coexist in such a lively and competitive arena. I absolutely love playing in Pokemon VGC and I think the Elite 4 would be a way to not only better myself in the competitive video game format, but others as well.How long have you played the Pokemon video games?- I have played the Pokemon video games ever since Pokemon Yellow Version first appeared on the Game Boy.What is your (if any) experience in the competitive scene for the Pokemon video game?-I have been playing competitively in VGC for 3 years now. In 2010, I placed 9th at the Regionals in Arlington, 7th at Nationals in Indianapolis in the Senior Division, thus earning a full-expense trip to Kona, Hawaii for the Worlds Championships, where I placed 14th. Last year, I placed 3rd at the Arlington Regionals and 9th at Pokemon Nationals in the Masters division.How much time in a week, on average, can you devote to being available for challenges?I can probably devote a couple of hours every day for challenges, most likely more time on the weekends as I am a college student.Explain your attitude towards wining and losing a battle.- Well, you win some and you lose some. Winning a battle brings joy and pride, but there's no need to ever put the opponent down and speak slander. Same for losing matches. If you lose, there's no need to get mad at your opponent because it is all just a game. I just keep my head held up and take the loss, then wish my opponent good luck for his/her upcoming match and leave it at that.Careful Sableye @ Mental HerbAbility: PranksterFake OutWill-o-WispToxicRecoverSableye is meant to be the Pokemon that makes the scenario a little bit better so that your ally Pokemon can attack, since Sableye knows Fake Out. It also can't be Faked Out or hit by fighting moves, making it the prime counter for Hitmontop leads and such. Its' Will-o-Wisp also cripples physical attackers so that your team can take more hits and have an easier time KOing their mons. Toxic, Will-o-Wisp, and Confuse Ray all take priority due to Prankster, so Sableye is considered the disruption Pokemon on the team as well.Quiet Chandelure @ Focus SashAbility: Flash FireHeat WaveShadow BallTrick RoomImprisonChandelure can be used firstly as a sweeper or a Trick Room setup Pokemon. It boasts a huge SpAtk at 216 with max SpAtk EVs, so Heat Wave and Shadow Ball both deal heavy damage. Imprison is to counter opposing Chandelure's or Musharna or Jellicent, or any Trick Room setup mon. Also, it pairs up nicely with Sableye as Sableye can Will-o-Wisp Chandelure and give the already-high SpAtk a boost on Heat Wave.Brave Conkeldurr @ LeftoversAbility: GutsRock SlideDrain PunchPaybackProtectConkeldurr is a Trick Room physical sweeper that boasts a 200+ Atk with max Attack EVs. It deals heavy damage to an array of VGC-competitive standard Pokemon, such as Latios, Zapdos, Gastrodon, Thundurus, Tornadus, Metagross, etc. Payback is used to help counter Psychic Pokemon. Rock Slide is to help KO genies and Zapdos, while Drain Punch is used to do raw STAB damage to many Pokemon.Brave Gallade @ Lum BerryAbility: JustifiedClose CombatIce PunchPsycho CutProtectGallade is another raw physical sweeper in Trick Room and a threat to many teams. If switched in at the correct time, you can get Gallade hit by a Crunch or other Dark move to skyrocket its' Atk to 291, helping KO many things. It can also be taught Trick Room over Psycho Cut in order to have an extra Trick Room Pokemon on the team. Close Combat does heavy damage to Tyranitar, Hitmonotp, Terrakion, and other standard mons. Ice Punch is for Salamence, the genies, and Garchomp. Lum Berry is gven to couteract an opposing Confuse Ray, Swagger, Toxic, or Will-o-Wisp that threatens Gallade in battle.Quiet Gastrodon @ Rindo BerryAbility: Storm DrainMuddy WaterEarth PowerRecoverProtectGastrodon is amazing because it's Special Atk is above average and its' ability is amazing. It takes in Water-moves and gets a SpAtk boost, helping OHKO many Pokemon, especially Chandelure and Metagross and helps dealing with Scizor much more manageable. Its' speed is also very low, so it is a great mon to counter Rain Dance teams and does wonders against Sandstorm teams. Since it is 4x weak to Grass, Rindo Berry is given in order to survive a Giga Drain or Grass Knot.Quiet Politoed @ Water GemAbility: DrizzleIce BeamSurfHypnosisProtectPolitoed works very well in Trick Room because it goes hand-in-hand with Gastrodon, using an already-boosted Surf from Ran Dance along with a STAB AND Water Gem, and it gives Gastrodon a SpAtk boost. Hypnosis is used to help put your opponent's sweeper's to sleep. The accuracy makes it risky, but the move does wonders if it hits. Ice Beam is predominantly used to help fight against opposing Gastrodons and dragon-type Pokemon.That is my team of a standard Trick Room team I have used, it is pretty self-explanatory, using slow Pokemon in Trick Room to sweep the opponent by covering each others' typing. I really hope my experience and team-building expertise can get me into the Elite 4-PokemanMaster"

It can also be taught Trick Room over Psycho Cut in order to have an extra Trick Room Pokemon on the team. Close Combat does heavy damage to Tyranitar, Hitmonotp, Terrakion, and other standard mons. Ice Punch is for Salamence, the genies, and Garchomp. Lum Berry is gven to couteract an opposing Confuse Ray, Swagger, Toxic, or Will-o-Wisp that threatens Gallade in battle.Quiet Gastrodon @ Rindo BerryAbility: Storm DrainMuddy WaterEarth PowerRecoverProtectGastrodon is amazing because it's Special Atk is above average and its' ability is amazing. It takes in Water-moves and gets a SpAtk boost, helping OHKO many Pokemon, especially Chandelure and Metagross and helps dealing with Scizor much more manageable. Its' speed is also very low, so it is a great mon to counter Rain Dance teams and does wonders against Sandstorm teams. Since it is 4x weak to Grass, Rindo Berry is given in order to survive a Giga Drain or Grass Knot.Quiet Politoed @ Water GemAbility: DrizzleIce BeamSurfHypnosisProtectPolitoed works very well in Trick Room because it goes hand-in-hand with Gastrodon, using an already-boosted Surf from Ran Dance along with a STAB AND Water Gem, and it gives Gastrodon a SpAtk boost. Hypnosis is used to help put your opponent's sweeper's to sleep. The accuracy makes it risky, but the move does wonders if it hits. Ice Beam is predominantly used to help fight against opposing Gastrodons and dragon-type Pokemon.That is my team of a standard Trick Room team I have used, it is pretty self-explanatory, using slow Pokemon in Trick Room to sweep the opponent by covering each others' typing. I really hope my experience and team-building expertise can get me into the Elite 4-PokemanMaster"

2012-08-31T12:06:02-0700,"sweet I'm all ready! here's the application-Why do you want to be a part of the Elite 4? I want to be a part of the E4 because I'm in the senior division and most people think that the seniors don't have the skills or knowlage of the masters and i would like to show that a senior can beat masters constantly and still do well against higher age divisions.How long have you played the Pokemon video games? I can't remember when i started as i was so young. the first game i played was ruby when it had come out recently.What is your (if any) experience in the competitive scene for the Pokemon video game? I Have lots of experience for competitive play for the video games. i started playing competitively 3-4 years ago and i have made it to nationals twice and almost top cut this year but was stuck at 35th place.How much time in a week, on average, can you devote to being available for challenges? very often, as long as i don't have school in the way. I should be able to do maybe a hour or 2 a night.Explain your attitude towards wining and losing a battle. Winning a battle is great, but it's usually a close match so i congratulate the opponent and it's usually a crit or flinch hax that lead me to win and it's always a good game and even if the opponent is down from losing, i try to cheer them up. losing myself, i normally same good game and shake hands and comment about their team and how i didn't expect a move or pokemon that really threatened me the whole game.Please list an example team you would use for the VGC 2012 format. Explanation of choices is preferred. ok well here is my example team- (should i list ev's a such? just wondering but i won't for now.)breloomitem-choice scarfnature-adamantability-effect sporelow sweepseed bombsporerock slidethis breloom is made to either spore the opposing team or deal heavy damage with its stab moves. the last slot was for rock slide to counter the zapdos, thunderus, tornadus, and other pokemon that are rock weak. it also covers fire types that destroy breloom. the scarf makes it able to out speed many pokemon that aren't scarfed.infernapeitem-life orbnature- jollyability-blazefake outclose combatflare blitzu-turnthis infernape is a lead that is designed to fake out one of the opposing pokemon, while my other lead (breloom) would spore te=he non-flinched one. this is designed to hit hard, and u-turn out to attack later in the game. It isn't running a sash as i am also using t-tar and with sand storm it breaks the sash making it pointless. I normally like weavile more as it gets more coverage and has faster speed but leading breloom weavile is a bad idea as heat wave zapdos can destroy them.t-taritem-sashnature-modestability-sand streamdark pulsethunder boltfire blastice beamthis is a specially offensive t-tar and it is a monster. its weak to many pokemon so it carries a sash to live and it hits hard and for coverage. sand stream disrupts weather and this hits pretty much every pokemon in the metagame for weakness.garchompitem-bright powdernature-jollyability-sand veildragon rushEQrock slideprotectthis is the standard garchomp set but with dragon rush. i feel like dragon claw, while with perfect accuracy, doesn't do enough damage for me so i prefer dragon rush. this set it used to abuse the evasion boosts to the max by hitting hard and not getting hit very much.thunderusitem-electric gemnature-timidability-pranksterthunder wavethunder boltsubstitutedark pulsethunderus is a great pokemon to cripple the other team. with it getting priority with prankster, it can thunderwave before any pokemon has attacked or substitute and set up a wall. thunder bolt and dark pulse are the attacking moves and thunder bolt does massive damage with the electric gemrotom-cutitem-choice specsnature-timidability-levatateleaf stormvolt switchshadow balltrickrotom provides the grass type this team needs. it hits fast and hard and can trick its specs onto something that is terrible with them such as a physical attacker or some support pokemon. this counters rain teams and counters water pokemon that this team has trouble with.so that was my example team and hope i become a E4 member!~Jake"
2012-09-01T16:31:49-0700,"Why do you want to be a part of the Elite 4?- I want to join the Elite 4 to further spread the influence of Pokemon VGC and the interesting formats that coexist in such a lively and competitive arena. I absolutely love playing in Pokemon VGC and I think the Elite 4 would be a way to not only better myself in the competitive video game format, but others as well.How long have you played the Pokemon video games?- I have played the Pokemon video games ever since Pokemon Yellow Version first appeared on the Game Boy.What is your (if any) experience in the competitive scene for the Pokemon video game?-I have been playing competitively in VGC for 3 years now. In 2010, I placed 9th at the Regionals in Arlington, 7th at Nationals in Indianapolis in the Senior Division, thus earning a full-expense trip to Kona, Hawaii for the Worlds Championships, where I placed 14th. Last year, I placed 3rd at the Arlington Regionals and 9th at Pokemon Nationals in the Masters division.How much time in a week, on average, can you devote to being available for challenges?I can probably devote a couple of hours every day for challenges, most likely more time on the weekends as I am a college student.Explain your attitude towards wining and losing a battle.- Well, you win some and you lose some. Winning a battle brings joy and pride, but there's no need to ever put the opponent down and speak slander. Same for losing matches. If you lose, there's no need to get mad at your opponent because it is all just a game. I just keep my head held up and take the loss, then wish my opponent good luck for his/her upcoming match and leave it at that.Careful Sableye @ Mental HerbAbility: PranksterFake OutWill-o-WispToxicRecoverSableye is meant to be the Pokemon that makes the scenario a little bit better so that your ally Pokemon can attack, since Sableye knows Fake Out. It also can't be Faked Out or hit by fighting moves, making it the prime counter for Hitmontop leads and such. Its' Will-o-Wisp also cripples physical attackers so that your team can take more hits and have an easier time KOing their mons. Toxic, Will-o-Wisp, and Confuse Ray all take priority due to Prankster, so Sableye is considered the disruption Pokemon on the team as well.Quiet Chandelure @ Focus SashAbility: Flash FireHeat WaveShadow BallTrick RoomImprisonChandelure can be used firstly as a sweeper or a Trick Room setup Pokemon. It boasts a huge SpAtk at 216 with max SpAtk EVs, so Heat Wave and Shadow Ball both deal heavy damage. Imprison is to counter opposing Chandelure's or Musharna or Jellicent, or any Trick Room setup mon. Also, it pairs up nicely with Sableye as Sableye can Will-o-Wisp Chandelure and give the already-high SpAtk a boost on Heat Wave.Brave Conkeldurr @ LeftoversAbility: GutsRock SlideDrain PunchPaybackProtectConkeldurr is a Trick Room physical sweeper that boasts a 200+ Atk with max Attack EVs. It deals heavy damage to an array of VGC-competitive standard Pokemon, such as Latios, Zapdos, Gastrodon, Thundurus, Tornadus, Metagross, etc. Payback is used to help counter Psychic Pokemon. Rock Slide is to help KO genies and Zapdos, while Drain Punch is used to do raw STAB damage to many Pokemon.Brave Gallade @ Lum BerryAbility: JustifiedClose CombatIce PunchPsycho CutProtectGallade is another raw physical sweeper in Trick Room and a threat to many teams.

For a select few players who competed at the 2012 Pokémon World Championships in Hawaii, their hard work, dedication, and success earned them a place in the upcoming Pokémon Black Version 2 and Pokémon White Version 2 video games launching 12th October in the UK.The Pokémon Company International announced today that 12 video game finalists from this year’s Pokémon World Championships—including three-time World Champion Ray Rizzo—will be the basis for Pokémon Trainers in Pokémon Black Version 2 and Pokémon White Version 2 to challenge players as part of the in-game Pokémon World Tournament. Beginning on 22nd October, three distribution events via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service will unlock Pokémon World Tournament events featuring those finalists. Each distribution will feature four finalists from a Pokémon World Championships age division, and you can battle them after reaching the Pokémon World Tournament found in the Unova region’s Driftveil City.You will battle the Pokémon teams that these top Trainers used at the 2012 Pokémon World Championships, including their moves, held items, Abilities, and Natures. Ray Rizzo’s lineup of Tyranitar, Garchomp, Cresselia, Hydreigon, Metagross, and Rotom proved too strong for the competition as he battled his way to an unprecedented third Pokémon World Championships title. The Pokémon World Tournament gives players the chance to test their mettle against Gym Leaders and other popular Trainers from past Pokémon games, as well as these real-world Pokémon Trainers.To participate in the Pokémon World Tournament distributions, you will need to have a copy of Pokémon Black Version 2 or Pokémon White Version 2, a system in the Nintendo DS family or the Nintendo 3DS, and wireless broadband Internet access.

For a select few players who competed at the 2012 Pokémon World Championships in Hawaii, their hard work, dedication, and success earned them a place in the upcoming Pokémon Black Version 2 and Pokémon White Version 2 video games launching 12th October in the UK.The Pokémon Company International announced today that 12 video game finalists from this year’s Pokémon World Championships—including three-time World Champion Ray Rizzo—will be the basis for Pokémon Trainers in Pokémon Black Version 2 and Pokémon White Version 2 to challenge players as part of the in-game Pokémon World Tournament. Beginning on 22nd October, three distribution events via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service will unlock Pokémon World Tournament events featuring those finalists. Each distribution will feature four finalists from a Pokémon World Championships age division, and you can battle them after reaching the Pokémon World Tournament found in the Unova region’s Driftveil City.You will battle the Pokémon teams that these top Trainers used at the 2012 Pokémon World Championships, including their moves, held items, Abilities, and Natures. Ray Rizzo’s lineup of Tyranitar, Garchomp, Cresselia, Hydreigon, Metagross, and Rotom proved too strong for the competition as he battled his way to an unprecedented third Pokémon World Championships title. The Pokémon World Tournament gives players the chance to test their mettle against Gym Leaders and other popular Trainers from past Pokémon games, as well as these real-world Pokémon Trainers.To participate in the Pokémon World Tournament distributions, you will need to have a copy of Pokémon Black Version 2 or Pokémon White Version 2, a system in the Nintendo DS family or the Nintendo 3DS, and wireless broadband Internet access. More information, including dates for all three distributions, the complete list of finalists that will be included in the distributions, and further instructions on how to participate, will be announced 15th October.To learn more about the Pokémon Black Version 2 and Pokémon White Version 2 games, please go to Pokemon.co.uk/BlackWhite2.About PokémonThe Pokémon Company International, a subsidiary of The Pokémon Company in Japan, manages the property outside of Asia and is responsible for brand management, licensing, marketing, the Pokémon Trading Card Game, the animated TV series, home entertainment, and the official Pokémon website.

Consumers who purchase either of the new games early will have the opportunity to connect to Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection (broadband Internet access required) before Nov. 12 to receive the Mythical Pokémon Genesect for the first time ever through a free, limited-time distribution.

Modified by Team Plasma, this Pokémon has a signature move called Techno Blast. Genesect is the only known Pokémon with this move. Genesect is a Bug- and Steel-type Pokémon with the ability to adjust its power levels based on the foe it's battling.

2012-09-07T22:13:37-0700,No it comes out on 10/7 I believe. So you could probably get Genesect day 1 if you hustle on over to the Pokemon Center.
2012-09-07T22:26:46-0700,"Wow, WiFi event for BW2 on day 1. I wonder how many people, especially kids, will burn through the game with Genesect in their party. Makes me wonder if Meloetta will be released sometime soon as well.~Cyber~"
2012-09-08T03:53:12-0700,That's what I was thinking. A rep there did tell me there would be an event... She also said people line up from like 3 am too sooooo... Not worth it for me unless there's a promo card involved as well.

2012-09-10T13:08:06-0700,"Genesect event officially announcedPURCHASE POKÉMON BLACK VERSION 2 OR WHITE VERSION 2 EARLY TO TAKE PART IN DISTRIBUTION FOR GENESECTREDMOND, Wash., Sept. 10, 2012 – The release of the Pokémon Black Version 2 and Pokémon White Version 2 games for the Nintendo DS family of systems is quickly approaching, and Nintendo is giving fans yet another reason to be excited about their Oct. 7 launch. Consumers who purchase either of the new games early will have the opportunity to connect to Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection (broadband Internet access required) before Nov. 12 to receive the Mythical Pokémon Genesect for the first time ever through a free, limited-time distribution. In Pokémon Black Version 2 and Pokémon White Version 2 – which are also playable in 2D on Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo 3DS XL systems – players will return to the Unova region and embark on a new adventure set two years after the events of the Pokémon Black Version and Pokémon White Version games.Genesect, the newly discovered Mythical Pokémon, has been restored from a 300-million-year-old fossil. Modified by Team Plasma, this Pokémon has a signature move called Techno Blast. Genesect is the only known Pokémon with this move. Genesect is a Bug- and Steel-type Pokémon with the ability to adjust its power levels based on the foe it's battling. This powerful Pokémon will be available Oct. 7 through Nov. 12 in the United States.""Not only can players dive into a brand new adventure on Oct. 7 with Pokémon Black Version 2 and Pokémon White Version 2, they also can receive an incredible new Pokémon right off the bat,"" said Scott Moffitt, Nintendo of America's executive vice president of Sales & Marketing. ""This limited-time distribution will get players off to a great start with what is sure to be one of 2012's biggest games.""The Unova region of Pokémon Black Version 2 and Pokémon White Version 2 has undergone significant changes, and new additions can be found in both Black City and White Forest. Black Tower is now a part of the Black City found in Pokémon Black Version 2, while White Treehollow is found in the White Forest of Pokémon White Version 2. In Black Tower and White Treehollow, players can battle with high-level Pokémon to earn Exp. Points and items. The layouts of the Black Tower and White Treehollow are randomly generated, creating a unique experience that will challenge players to solve their maze-like construction and defeat the Trainers who stand in their way again and again.Pokémon Black Version 2 and Pokémon White Version 2 are now available for pre-order from major retailers throughout North America for a suggested retail price of $34.99 each.

2012-09-11T04:23:26-0700,"Any Pokemon game is almost guaranteed to sell 10 million copies over its lifetime. Every single main-series game has sold at least 14 million. Every single third game has sold at least 6 million. Both of the Remakes have sold at least 10 million.The only Pokemon games to sell less than a million copies are the really obscure titles. And Conquest, which IMO is a better game than the standard Pokemon RPG (but that's just me)."

2012-08-22T18:57:10-0700,VGC 2012? Heh........
2012-08-22T19:08:07-0700,"^VGC 2013 rules are the same as VGC 2012 rules. I am waiting on the source to update to post the info when it is ""confirmed"" on the official site."
2012-08-22T19:08:42-0700,"I know they are the same lol, good choice with the VGC metagame as whole though"
2012-08-22T19:30:54-0700,"^Ah, I see....... sorry to misunderstand the ""Heh"".......:thumb:"
2012-08-22T23:16:09-0700,As the only player with wins on pokegym battles....does that make me champion? =D
2012-08-23T04:25:05-0700,It is called modified - you don't see the TCG using 20XX rules do you? :tongue:
2012-08-23T21:15:05-0700,am i allowed to use BW2 pokemon? like pokies with Dw abilities that were released in bw2? just wondering
2012-08-24T00:27:12-0700,"Pokemon with DW abilities (that have become available legitimately) are usable in this event. BW2 cartridges can not be used at this time, as the games are not available in the USA."
2012-08-24T07:04:41-0700,Does that include DW abilities released through BW2 (i.e. Technician Breloom)?
2012-08-26T11:57:27-0700,"^Yes, all DW abilities that have been legaly released can be used. The use of the BW2 cartridges is not allowed at this time."
2012-08-26T17:40:03-0700,"Didn't see it on the 2012 rules, but will Keldeo be legal? I know trying to use GTS it says he is not usable, so just curios."
2012-08-26T19:37:02-0700,Keldeo will not be a legal Pokemon for this event. Genesect and Milotto will not be able to be used in the event as well.
2012-08-25T00:19:35-0700,"Well- Breeding has had a big addition added into BW2 as to the way Nature and Abilities go.I for one like the new additions/changes to the breeding scene, as breeding can be a timely but rewarding factor when building a battle worthy Pokemon.Gone are the slave-labor task of having to breed so many times to just get the right nature. And the change in the percentage of getting the ability you want are now an 80% chance of getting the correct ability!(I know what it is like to breed for a good amount of time, just to get the right nature with the right IV's, yet to only not get the ability I want)Egg hatching time is also now reduced, using the join feature.Time to breed like crazy!Check out this information located here:http://www.serebii.net/black2white2/breed.shtmlWhat do you guys think?

2012-08-25T10:57:31-0700,"Breeding is so tedious, but Game Freak seems to also know that such a complex process is the only way to really allow you to customize your Pokemon to the fullest.Love these changes. Getting the Incubator(s) seems like it'll be a pain, I haven't heard a whole lot about join - but if you were to get it, the ability to ""instantly"" hatch most eggs would be so worth it.It's too bad that using Ditto nullifies their Ability changes though."

2012-08-26T00:06:55-0700,"The incubating thing sounds the best, finally no more endless biking runs!"
2012-08-26T01:05:52-0700,"I am curious to know if we are still able to use Orbs to speed up hatch time and combine it with incubaters.I am glad for one thing about bike hatching is at least in BW, you can go onto the bridge and collect feathers. Sure, it does at a minute amount of aditional time, but when you have 4 eggs in your party (one high level ""fly"" Pokemon and Magby to cut the hatch time)- you end up with a great amount of feathers in no time. On average, I get 32 feathers in a minute's time, but you only get that many if you ride in a 1 square frame like down at the end next to the door and the boy (where the girl disapears)--but it comes in handy to not have to EV train when you could:hatchvitaminsuse feathersslap on the lucky eggand your good to go take your ev'd level 1 Pokemon and go level it up."
2012-08-26T02:52:40-0700,I read about these too and I'm really happy to hear it! I am definitely going to Masuda Method some competitive shinies when I get this. Though I'd also need the Shining Charm to help with it.

2012-06-04T18:33:12-0700,What do you guys think of the new Pokémon game coming out? Pokémon Conquest is a game where you'll be a Warlord!There is a site on Pokémon.com all about it found here:http://www.pokemonconquest.com/en-usIt seems interesting and a change from the normal Pokémon style. DO you think you'll get it?
2012-06-04T18:39:01-0700,"The moment I get that game, I will squee for about an hour. I've been waiting for a Pokemon strategy RPG for a long time. I just wish this one had more variety in terms of attacks."
2012-06-04T19:06:09-0700,"Personally I'm still a touch wary of it, but I'll be buying it regardless. I like Pokemon and tactical RPGs, but both together is a bit odd."
2012-06-04T19:50:16-0700,"I'm looking forward to it, hopefully it will be a good game."
2012-06-04T20:48:33-0700,"I am with Regi on this one. I am going to wait a little while before getting it. I would like to check it out from a friend or play it a bit. I am old school for RPG games like Final Fantasy. I have nothing negative to say about the game so far, and I will check it out in due time."
2012-06-04T21:44:56-0700,This game Looks a like that YUgioh Game that come on the game cubeanyways i might buy it but i might not sounds like another spin off of a spinoff
2012-06-05T04:13:37-0700,It's closer to a simplified Disgaea or Fire Emblem.
2012-06-05T04:42:40-0700,"He's probably think of the ""YuGiOh Duelist of the Roses"" game"
2012-06-05T10:04:59-0700,actually Yu-Gi-Oh! Falsebound Kingdomoh back on topic this game looks interesting
2012-06-05T10:19:02-0700,"I've been playing the Japanese version of them game and I'll say its ok at best. It was a good attempt at this style of RPG but it has some main issues.One of them is that the Pokemon on can do 1 attack. You can really setup in a way like you could in the FFT games. Another one is the lack of Pokemon. Articuno is in the game but not Zapdos or Moltres and I have a problem with that. A lot of my favorites are not in the game so when I found that out, I stopped playing.Can't tell you much about the story. It's just you stopping warlords from taking over the world with Pokemon."
2012-06-05T13:06:43-0700,Are Eevee and it's Evolutions in it?
2012-06-05T13:12:58-0700,"^Eevee is the Pokemon you start out with, I am not certain if the Eevee will evolve into a peticular one. If there are no stones in the game that you can obtain, I assume that Eseon and Umbreon are the most likely to happen if the game implements evolution in the mechanics for game play and traditional friendship evolution claus."
2012-06-05T13:22:18-0700,Yes. I evolved my Eevee into Vaporeon and a friend of mine evolved his into Glaceon. The problem was I did not know I had a water stone or even knew I obtained one.
2012-06-05T20:18:34-0700,"Awesome at the fact that you start with Eevee, one of my favorite Pokemon(if not my favorite). Not so awesome at the fact that you may have no influence on how it evolves. :/"
2012-06-05T20:38:10-0700,Actually I think serebii had linked the different ways to get Eevee or something like that...I believe it is controllable.Either that or I'll be doing my hardest to influence mine to turn into an Espeon.
2012-06-06T11:41:49-0700,"^Here is the link that list's the Pokemon in the game from Serebii:http://www.serebii.net/conquest/pokemon.shtmlIt gives details on the Pokemon in the game, and if anyone wants to dig around a little more they can click on what they want to gain more info on the Pokemon."
2012-06-06T22:20:25-0700,The thing I love about Pokemon Conquest is that I can always go...JIGGLYPUFF AWESOMENESS TIME!!!Get what I'm sayin'?
2012-06-08T17:32:14-0700,I hate this game... there is no salamence or porygonz???? Sux I thought it might be good but I'm rethinking it... Bu t it is the only time I've seen Ekans look cool.
2012-06-08T21:22:34-0700,I don't think Pokemon was allowed to do any of the art for the game. None of the designs look like it belongs to them.The one thing I hate seeing in Pokemon game is the fact that they don't put all of them in. It's really annoying when they do that.
2012-06-09T06:23:00-0700,"BTW, that art is incredible. I'm hoping there's a booklet that comes with the game for all that good stuff..."
2012-06-09T19:09:42-0700,"^I agree on the art work. It adds a more mature touch to the game. I would love to see this artwork switch over to the future Pokémon games. This type of artwork adds that ""serious"" hint to it while touching lightly to the mature side of the style the game is presented by way of the theme."
2012-06-09T19:28:50-0700,That's not really what I'm talking about. I'm kinda bored with the Sugimori art right now. The art for Conquest is amazing compared to how stale Sugimori has become. Like a breath of fresh air. I hope some of that gets put on TCGs...
2012-06-09T23:06:04-0700,'Tis is true. The last cool Sugimori card was that really cool Porygon.
2012-06-09T23:59:12-0700,"Sorry about that Bullados. I did not research the artist, I am not all that familiar in the “artist's” info for this sort of subject. I dig the artwork for the game is all."
2012-06-10T09:38:25-0700,"I feel the same way. I don't use Sugimori art as nothing more the concept art. it's good to use as a reference but should almost never be used in published media.I feel the use of his art on the cards make adds a sense of 'lazyness' to the production value. As an artist myself, I use the cards as a tool to make myself better as a artist. I look at how they draw, the styles used and how they use color and lighting (which is a big deal for me). When I see Sugimori's art on the cards, I see nothing more then stock art and a photo of a photoshop background. It's just lazy to me.It's fine in a Pokemon guide book or other pokemon related stuff but when you have other artist working on art for the card, using Sugimori's art should not be a option."
2012-06-12T16:34:52-0700,I love Final Fantasy Tactics for GBA but this seems so different than that.Pokemon only have one attack. You have to 'catch' all the generals in order to use each pokemon to their maximum level.It just doesn't seem like a game I'd enjoy.
2012-06-12T18:14:07-0700,"I'm down for a Final Fantasy style Pokemon mash-up game. Pokemon would level up as normal, learn attacks like normal- I think it would be great for the RPG branch off. I have not played Final Fantasy Tactics, but I am a player of most of the Final Fantasy games of the past. FF3 (USA release for the Super Nintendo) has a soft spot in my game days, it would be sweet to play a Pokemon game that had this aspect.Having a Pokemon restricted to one move is silly- takes alot away from the Pokemon's reputation to put up a good battle.meh, like I said, I'd try out the game before buying it. Still love the artwork for it, and the ""attempt"" to move Pokemon into a different way to play."
2012-06-12T20:34:30-0700,"I'm gonna get it as soon as I can. Even if it isn't such a good game, I'll probably enjoy it for the storyline if not for the game-play."
2012-06-13T08:55:46-0700,Eh... I'd rather stick to my Fire Emblem for these sort of games. I think it'll bore me.
2012-06-13T10:07:05-0700,"Final Fantasy Tactics was unlike other traditional FF games. It involved moving your characters around a battlefield, like in Pokemon Conquest, and attacks had a certain range. It had some starting classes for each character on your team, which they could swap between at any time (like from going from a Black Mage to a White Mage), and as they learn skills from the various classes, would be able to access newer classes like Blue Mage and Time Mage. It was a really fun game. So matches came down to placement on the battlefield and which classes you brought to the battle."
2012-06-19T07:41:18-0700,"I just got the game yesterday morning, It's actually alot of fun. Not quite like FF tactics, but certainly alot of fun. I think it involves a little more strategy than the normal game ( when your just playing not neccasarily competitive) because you have to manage your warriors in and out of battle. Its a fresh change to pokemon that I enjoy alot. Highly reccomend it."
2012-06-19T09:30:58-0700,I pre-ordered it and look forward to picking it up today. I watched a play through of the Japenese version but i look forward to being able to know what the tiems do and what the people say. Im pretty well a sucker for most Pokemon games (except Rumble-which has always interested me but i havent got yet- and the third round of Dungeon games).
2012-06-19T13:36:39-0700,"I got it today after pre-ordering it. Haven't go the chance to actually play it yet, though...."
2012-06-19T19:46:26-0700,"I have been playing this game for hours and I love it. However, I have been trying to figure out how to catch Pokemon for hours and I have no clue whatsoever. I read the manual, looked at forums, tried Google, and this link mechanic everyone is talking about doesn't seem to be in my game. I'm at the point where I am at a type disadvantage if I try to go conquer anyone, and I have four castles, but the mechanic is still not there. Am I doing something horribly wrong? Can someone explain this to me in small words or pictures or something? If it weren't for this, and not knowing whether or not I should be able to do it or not, I would really love this game, but at three hours in no Pokemon link tutorial is really frustrating"
2012-06-19T20:54:06-0700,"What I've read is you have to gain new war allies in the game by beating them quickly. Check out serebii, they have the best information I've found."
2012-06-19T21:35:53-0700,"I had checked there --- gaining allies and gaining Pokemon for your allies are different, but it turns out the tutorial just didn't happen for another castle. Which is surprising and confusing because dialogue about how great it would be to use Pokemon of types you can't get yet happens, but I am now off to the races. The Link mechanic just takes forever to show up. Thanks for the suggestion, though!"
2012-06-20T14:13:23-0700,"Finally had time to play it, and it is lots of fun! I am so happy to have Eevee as my starter."
2012-06-20T21:19:55-0700,I'm sure you are JewelQuest. I might try to get it myself and hope that I can get Jigglypuff early game.
2012-06-21T04:10:47-0700,Early game? You get it on the first battle automatically.
2012-06-21T12:49:30-0700,What he said. lol.
2012-06-23T15:40:51-0700,"JIGGLYPUFF AWESOMENESS TIME!!!!Thank you Pokemon Conquest, I love you."
2012-07-08T16:24:57-0700,"Ok...has anyone else been having problems even finding Pokemon Conquest in stores? I figured I'd go ahead and get it this week to enjoy with the holiday in the middle and all, but I couldn't find the bloody game in any store. Walmart, Gamestop, ToysRUs, Best Buy, all of them were sold out. I mean, did they just underproduce Conquest? Because this is the first time in many years I've ever had problems finding any videogame in stock, and Pokemon spinoff games have never been this popular..."
2012-07-08T16:30:42-0700,"Must be underproduced or just did unexpectedly well, because apparently even Amazon is starting to run low."
2012-07-08T18:32:16-0700,"Yep, I had the same problem. I had to call about 6 different Gamestops, 3 different Best Buys, 2 different Targets, and 2 TRUs before I found a copy. Thankfully, it was a Used copy. At Gamestop. $27 Conquest is amazing.Maybe we should start putting in Support tickets? Maybe then they'll see that they have a potential Platinum game on their hands, and they should make more of them?"
2012-07-08T19:25:24-0700,i Agree with the amazing part i Totally misjudged it great spin offanyone catch the region land is an a shape of a pokemon?
2012-07-09T13:04:11-0700,"Yeah, my sister pointed that out. I was like: Really? *Looks*I am loving my game. I finished the main story, but I can't seem to get any where in the others. It's rather irritating."
2012-07-09T13:12:04-0700,"Try evolving a warlord's Pokemon in one story to make it easier in another. For example, in the main story, I evolved Motochika's Oshawott all the way to Samurott and registered it in the gallery. Therefore, I started Motochika's story with a Samurott. Also, Guardian Charms are very powerful. One of my favorite tactics is to attack a full nation with a single strong Pokemon that has good matchuos and a Guardian Charm. It gives large amounts of link. I beat Mitsuhide's level before 2 years passed using that strategy."
2012-07-09T13:26:43-0700,Do i have to register the pokemon or something? what do you mean registering them?
2012-07-09T13:29:11-0700,"Use the warrior in a battle. The game then registers them into your warrior gallery.I know if you evolve a warlord, you have to register again. Not sure about new linked Pokemon or when Pokemon evolve."
2012-07-10T12:40:49-0700,"I am doing the Lightning gal's storyline....Ginchyo or something like that. I used her a lot in my main storyline so she does have a Luxray, as well as a Prinplup that that grabbed when I needed a Water type at one point. But I like Joltik(had Oichi play through with that instead of Jigglypuff), and she had one, so I had her use it instead. It might have been easier if I used Luxray....Lol.I prefer to get as many warriors as possible and beat them up with those. I love battling in Puglis, though, it's battlefield rocks.But I finally beat up Ranmaru and got four kingdoms of my own.Now, if I can beat up No...."
2012-07-10T12:44:42-0700,"Pugillis and Avia are awesome. I fended off Kenshin's Gallade in Pugillis with only a Magikarp, and in Avia, used Gracia and her Gothita against Nobunaga's Hydreigon and won."
2012-07-10T12:49:07-0700,"I lol'd at the Magikarp. That must have been...interesting.I usually have my Emolga in Pugillis(Or at least a couple flying types) because then I get knocked off, I get right back up.At the moment I can't remember which kingdom Avia is.........I had to restart the Lightning girl's storyline once because Ranmaru's army got too strong for me to defeat...At least I would be able to defeat it if they would give me five minutes peace. ;/"
2012-07-10T12:53:28-0700,Flying type. Avia is flying type.Magikarp and Gallade both have 3 range and the A.I. can be tricked. I had the Magikarp running from banner to banner clockwise with Gallade a banner behind until time ran out.
2012-07-10T12:56:20-0700,Do you guys know how to unlock nabunagas story?
2012-07-10T12:57:23-0700,"Beat 9 other stories, I think."
2012-07-10T21:17:39-0700,"That works.When protecting Crystellia, I usually have Elmoga fly into the water corner and wait their until time runs out...provided that the attackers don't have a flying type that I'm weak to and that none of their moves can hit be from where I am."
2012-07-12T18:57:25-0700,"Protip: If you want one of the Warlords, you have to beat them with one of your own Warlords, under the same restrictions that you get one of your soldiers. Early game, that's damn near impossible. And it doesn't really get any easier until you get some Warlords under your wing. There might be some that you just get through the story, but I don't know about those guys yet."
2012-07-12T19:56:41-0700,"^I think you get Mister Rhyperrior and Gallade in the story, and that's it. They are the ones who get a cut scene. Additionally, i don't believe you can get any Warlords who fight you with Nobunaga at the end (Mr. Infernape, Mismagius, Lapras, Aggron as i recall, maybe more) until post story."
2012-07-12T21:57:51-0700,While you can't get anyone after Kenshin and Shingen (the two you mentioned) all the warlords from before that wander around after you beat them if they didn't join you.
2012-07-13T04:26:25-0700,The WiFi event where you get Motonari and Motochika automatically helps a lot with getting other Warlords.
2012-07-13T05:56:35-0700,I beat 9 other stories but i still dont have him
2012-07-13T18:07:40-0700,"Quick random question: How do you start one of those downloaded episodes? Specifically, the Motonari & Motochika episode. No, I haven't beaten the game yet. I'm just trying to get a couple of actual Warlords, rather than the ton of Grunts I've picked up thus far..."
2012-07-13T19:31:44-0700,"Motonari and Motochika automatically join your team, but only in the main story. As for the additional episodes they automatically unlock once you beat the game and will be found on the last page.Also most of the warlords (as well as some rank ups) aren't available until you start playing the extra stories."
2012-07-13T21:01:01-0700,"Well I finally managed to hold a copy at ToysRUs, couldn't buy it since their system was down and for whatever reason they couldn't ring it up since it has the $10 giftcard you have to have rang up at the same time...so yeah, tomorrow thoughProbably spend the giftcard on cards or something."
2012-07-14T02:23:06-0700,"Except that they, y'know, haven't. Yes, I've downloaded the episode. I kinda need them so that I even have half a shot at recruiting the Shinx chick, who randomly showed up on my radar this month."
2012-07-14T08:41:43-0700,"Not to downplay the regular games, but I'm enjoying this way more than B/W, HG/SS, etc.I hope they make a 2nd one with more Pokemon..."
2012-07-14T13:43:02-0700,"I got Ginchyo pretty easily....She is one of the earliest ones you can get, so she isn't all that tough."
2012-07-14T14:13:14-0700,"The tough part is really positioning. It's rather difficult to recruit properly when you've only got two guys that can potentially recruit her (Eevee and Jiggly). Plus, trying to recruit the 2 guys with her as well. It's rather annoying..."
2012-07-14T15:05:07-0700,":/ Good point. Though I sort of gave up on both Eevee and Jigglypuff half way through, as they didn't do enough damage and I didn't want Eevee to evolve...That was before I knew that I could stop them from evolving."
2012-07-14T15:23:23-0700,"Don't know why they haven't. My best advice is to double check that you downloaded it. Beyond that I don't know why they haven't, since they joined automatically.In any case if you're having a hard time with Ginchyo you could wait until after you get Shingen and Kenshin since they automatically come with Rhyperior and Gallade."
2012-07-14T17:27:07-0700,"Ok so I just got the game, guess I have one question...I see all these things about recruiting and such...is everything basically repeatable until you can recruit everything? For example, I've never been a fan of having to restart or anything just because I miss something near the start or midway through the game that I can't get later on."
2012-07-14T17:36:50-0700,"Thus far, I've fought the Shinx warlord twice. My biggest problem is that I'm out of space to store my plebs. And I think that might be the reason why I'm having problems recruiting the Shinx warlord.It looks like there's a spire in the Electric Kingdom that lets you summon random Pokemon and Warriors based on a set Wisdom stat. I'm not certain how often you can use it, but it's there, and it's most certainly usable to pick up some guys you might have missed early on.I'm actually quite enjoying that there's no good FAQ out there for this game yet. It's something I haven't experienced in a long, long time. I'm hoping I finish before the complete FAQs can be released. That would be spectacular.Does the download take a month to work? Like, do I have to wait a month before those two decide to join me or something like that?"
2012-07-14T19:46:26-0700,"Once you've beaten the main story you're given several episodes to choose from that focus on a specific warlord. During these you're able to re-recruit any warriors/warlords you got previously and they'll have their old Pokemon. (their link % won't carry over) You can also go out and recruit Pokemon that were previously inaccessible by upgrading facilities via the bank.So a lot of stuff is repeatable, except the main story. (Don't worry you can get your main character back)Hope that helps.If you've run out of room you can select a full kingdom and kick someone out, or wait until you have more kingdoms under your command.As for the warlords, they probably activate a month later, the passwords work like that as well."
2012-07-14T19:58:08-0700,"Yep, they activated the next month. Actually, they're going to be a HUGE boon to my army, especially this month when I take their Chingling and Ralts into the Fighting kingdom. It's not a perfect army, and it's not as powerful as the one I'm facing, but I've now got type advantage with 3 Psychics, a Flying, and 2 Fires to counter their 4 pure Fightings and a pure Grass. This one will be GOOD."
2012-07-14T22:05:57-0700,"I guess another question...all these downloadable events, are they like repeatable or what? I'm not too clear on how they work..."
2012-07-14T23:31:44-0700,"Other than Motochika and Motonari (as they get added to your team in the main story), all the downloadable episodes are repeatable as are all the bonus episodes. You'll find them on the last page once you beat the game."
2012-07-15T18:18:26-0700,"I just got Pokemon Conquest a few hours ago and I'm liking it. In fact, I'm about to try and take over the Kingdom of Fontaine. I hope Jigglypuff survives."
2012-07-15T18:36:44-0700,"Water? Not too terrible. It gets worse. Much, much worse. And, also, strangely better. Right now, my biggest problem is that I'm out of room to collect new Warlords. And that's annoying me no end, as I've got to recruit the clown mime guy right now, and I've got no space left to grab him..."
2012-07-15T20:00:45-0700,You can run out of room to recruit people? Better make a note of that...is there a way to ditch warriors you've already recruited then?
2012-07-15T20:50:34-0700,"Sadly, I don't think there is a way to ditch warriors after you recruit them, But you can reject recruits."
2012-07-16T01:20:47-0700,"Yes you can. Once you've recruited the warrior, select a full kingdom and it will ask you to dismiss a warrior."
2012-07-16T04:33:20-0700,That annoyed me beyond anything. Why is there a limit to my recruiting?!? That's by far and away the most interesting part of the game (to me at least)! Why can't I just stash guys in something similar to a PC box or something? Why can't I get every Grunt that I come across? I had to ditch one of my earliest recruits because I needed a Warlord and this guy was weak.
2012-07-16T05:33:12-0700,Is this game worth buying? I've read reviews about how little gameplay / replay value there is.
2012-07-16T12:26:44-0700,It is the game I have played the most out of all of my games.
2012-07-16T14:20:13-0700,Who cares about replay value when there's about 30 hours of post-game material in addition to the 20+ hours of regular game material?There's always a good bit of RNG manipulation. Each battle is nearly randomly-generated as far as initial position. So no two battles are ever exactly alike.
2012-07-16T15:58:45-0700,"You've read some pretty inaccurate reviews... There are few games with more replay than this - especially if you take time to work on perfect links, evolving, and get into the multiplayer.I'd like to see a Risk-style multiplayer version of this game, though, where you and your opponents fight to control the Ransei region."
2012-07-17T08:10:43-0700,Heck I'd like to see tournament support for this more than the actual VG lol
2012-07-17T17:07:46-0700,"If there were more moves for each Pokemon, then I'd agree with you. But, as it currently stands, the game is all about type advantage and positioning. I'd like to see more variety in what you can do with your teams, especially given that the entire metagame would devolve to the same 20-ish Warlords and 40-ish Pokemon. There is so much that you could potentially do with this game, both on a casual and competitive level, that it would be a fantastic OP opportunity. But the current iteration? Not quite there yet...BTW, I'm now using Excel spreadsheets and Word to better organize my stuff and get my Perfect Links all taken care of. Bidoof sucks."
2012-07-17T19:40:38-0700,I think it would come down to personal preferences on Warlords. Even with only one attack type you're limited to six war lords and six Pokemon. I could see trying to make the best of what you have.
2012-07-17T19:45:27-0700,"I for one agree with Bullados. There are certain warlords that simply tower over others (Kenshin's Inspiration anyone), and many Pokemon are easily better than others (specifically legendaries). Which is all the more reason why we should have a sequel IMO."
2012-07-18T11:47:25-0700,Still waiting for it over here
2012-06-04T18:33:12-0700,What do you guys think of the new Pokémon game coming out? Pokémon Conquest is a game where you'll be a Warlord!There is a site on Pokémon.com all about it found here:http://www.pokemonconquest.com/en-usIt seems interesting and a change from the normal Pokémon style. DO you think you'll get it?
2012-06-04T18:39:01-0700,"The moment I get that game, I will squee for about an hour. I've been waiting for a Pokemon strategy RPG for a long time. I just wish this one had more variety in terms of attacks."
2012-06-04T19:06:09-0700,"Personally I'm still a touch wary of it, but I'll be buying it regardless. I like Pokemon and tactical RPGs, but both together is a bit odd."
2012-06-04T19:50:16-0700,"I'm looking forward to it, hopefully it will be a good game."
2012-06-04T20:48:33-0700,"I am with Regi on this one. I am going to wait a little while before getting it. I would like to check it out from a friend or play it a bit. I am old school for RPG games like Final Fantasy. I have nothing negative to say about the game so far, and I will check it out in due time."
2012-06-04T21:44:56-0700,This game Looks a like that YUgioh Game that come on the game cubeanyways i might buy it but i might not sounds like another spin off of a spinoff
2012-06-05T04:13:37-0700,It's closer to a simplified Disgaea or Fire Emblem.
2012-06-05T04:42:40-0700,"He's probably think of the ""YuGiOh Duelist of the Roses"" game"
2012-06-05T10:04:59-0700,actually Yu-Gi-Oh! Falsebound Kingdomoh back on topic this game looks interesting
2012-06-05T10:19:02-0700,"I've been playing the Japanese version of them game and I'll say its ok at best. It was a good attempt at this style of RPG but it has some main issues.One of them is that the Pokemon on can do 1 attack. You can really setup in a way like you could in the FFT games. Another one is the lack of Pokemon. Articuno is in the game but not Zapdos or Moltres and I have a problem with that. A lot of my favorites are not in the game so when I found that out, I stopped playing.Can't tell you much about the story. It's just you stopping warlords from taking over the world with Pokemon."
2012-06-05T13:06:43-0700,Are Eevee and it's Evolutions in it?
2012-06-05T13:12:58-0700,"^Eevee is the Pokemon you start out with, I am not certain if the Eevee will evolve into a peticular one. If there are no stones in the game that you can obtain, I assume that Eseon and Umbreon are the most likely to happen if the game implements evolution in the mechanics for game play and traditional friendship evolution claus."
2012-06-05T13:22:18-0700,Yes. I evolved my Eevee into Vaporeon and a friend of mine evolved his into Glaceon. The problem was I did not know I had a water stone or even knew I obtained one.
2012-06-05T20:18:34-0700,"Awesome at the fact that you start with Eevee, one of my favorite Pokemon(if not my favorite). Not so awesome at the fact that you may have no influence on how it evolves. :/"
2012-06-05T20:38:10-0700,Actually I think serebii had linked the different ways to get Eevee or something like that...I believe it is controllable.Either that or I'll be doing my hardest to influence mine to turn into an Espeon.
2012-06-06T11:41:49-0700,"^Here is the link that list's the Pokemon in the game from Serebii:http://www.serebii.net/conquest/pokemon.shtmlIt gives details on the Pokemon in the game, and if anyone wants to dig around a little more they can click on what they want to gain more info on the Pokemon."
2012-06-06T22:20:25-0700,The thing I love about Pokemon Conquest is that I can always go...JIGGLYPUFF AWESOMENESS TIME!!!Get what I'm sayin'?
2012-06-08T17:32:14-0700,I hate this game... there is no salamence or porygonz???? Sux I thought it might be good but I'm rethinking it... Bu t it is the only time I've seen Ekans look cool.
2012-06-08T21:22:34-0700,I don't think Pokemon was allowed to do any of the art for the game. None of the designs look like it belongs to them.The one thing I hate seeing in Pokemon game is the fact that they don't put all of them in. It's really annoying when they do that.
2012-06-09T06:23:00-0700,"BTW, that art is incredible. I'm hoping there's a booklet that comes with the game for all that good stuff..."
2012-06-09T19:09:42-0700,"^I agree on the art work. It adds a more mature touch to the game. I would love to see this artwork switch over to the future Pokémon games. This type of artwork adds that ""serious"" hint to it while touching lightly to the mature side of the style the game is presented by way of the theme."
2012-06-09T19:28:50-0700,That's not really what I'm talking about. I'm kinda bored with the Sugimori art right now. The art for Conquest is amazing compared to how stale Sugimori has become. Like a breath of fresh air. I hope some of that gets put on TCGs...
2012-06-09T23:06:04-0700,'Tis is true. The last cool Sugimori card was that really cool Porygon.
2012-06-09T23:59:12-0700,"Sorry about that Bullados. I did not research the artist, I am not all that familiar in the “artist's” info for this sort of subject. I dig the artwork for the game is all."
2012-06-10T09:38:25-0700,"I feel the same way. I don't use Sugimori art as nothing more the concept art. it's good to use as a reference but should almost never be used in published media.I feel the use of his art on the cards make adds a sense of 'lazyness' to the production value. As an artist myself, I use the cards as a tool to make myself better as a artist. I look at how they draw, the styles used and how they use color and lighting (which is a big deal for me). When I see Sugimori's art on the cards, I see nothing more then stock art and a photo of a photoshop background. It's just lazy to me.It's fine in a Pokemon guide book or other pokemon related stuff but when you have other artist working on art for the card, using Sugimori's art should not be a option."
2012-06-12T16:34:52-0700,I love Final Fantasy Tactics for GBA but this seems so different than that.Pokemon only have one attack. You have to 'catch' all the generals in order to use each pokemon to their maximum level.It just doesn't seem like a game I'd enjoy.
2012-06-12T18:14:07-0700,"I'm down for a Final Fantasy style Pokemon mash-up game. Pokemon would level up as normal, learn attacks like normal- I think it would be great for the RPG branch off. I have not played Final Fantasy Tactics, but I am a player of most of the Final Fantasy games of the past. FF3 (USA release for the Super Nintendo) has a soft spot in my game days, it would be sweet to play a Pokemon game that had this aspect.Having a Pokemon restricted to one move is silly- takes alot away from the Pokemon's reputation to put up a good battle.meh, like I said, I'd try out the game before buying it. Still love the artwork for it, and the ""attempt"" to move Pokemon into a different way to play."
2012-06-12T20:34:30-0700,"I'm gonna get it as soon as I can. Even if it isn't such a good game, I'll probably enjoy it for the storyline if not for the game-play."
2012-06-13T08:55:46-0700,Eh... I'd rather stick to my Fire Emblem for these sort of games. I think it'll bore me.
2012-06-13T10:07:05-0700,"Final Fantasy Tactics was unlike other traditional FF games. It involved moving your characters around a battlefield, like in Pokemon Conquest, and attacks had a certain range. It had some starting classes for each character on your team, which they could swap between at any time (like from going from a Black Mage to a White Mage), and as they learn skills from the various classes, would be able to access newer classes like Blue Mage and Time Mage. It was a really fun game. So matches came down to placement on the battlefield and which classes you brought to the battle."
2012-06-19T07:41:18-0700,"I just got the game yesterday morning, It's actually alot of fun. Not quite like FF tactics, but certainly alot of fun. I think it involves a little more strategy than the normal game ( when your just playing not neccasarily competitive) because you have to manage your warriors in and out of battle. Its a fresh change to pokemon that I enjoy alot. Highly reccomend it."
2012-06-19T09:30:58-0700,I pre-ordered it and look forward to picking it up today. I watched a play through of the Japenese version but i look forward to being able to know what the tiems do and what the people say. Im pretty well a sucker for most Pokemon games (except Rumble-which has always interested me but i havent got yet- and the third round of Dungeon games).
2012-06-19T13:36:39-0700,"I got it today after pre-ordering it. Haven't go the chance to actually play it yet, though...."
2012-06-19T19:46:26-0700,"I have been playing this game for hours and I love it. However, I have been trying to figure out how to catch Pokemon for hours and I have no clue whatsoever. I read the manual, looked at forums, tried Google, and this link mechanic everyone is talking about doesn't seem to be in my game. I'm at the point where I am at a type disadvantage if I try to go conquer anyone, and I have four castles, but the mechanic is still not there. Am I doing something horribly wrong? Can someone explain this to me in small words or pictures or something? If it weren't for this, and not knowing whether or not I should be able to do it or not, I would really love this game, but at three hours in no Pokemon link tutorial is really frustrating"
2012-06-19T20:54:06-0700,"What I've read is you have to gain new war allies in the game by beating them quickly. Check out serebii, they have the best information I've found."
2012-06-19T21:35:53-0700,"I had checked there --- gaining allies and gaining Pokemon for your allies are different, but it turns out the tutorial just didn't happen for another castle. Which is surprising and confusing because dialogue about how great it would be to use Pokemon of types you can't get yet happens, but I am now off to the races. The Link mechanic just takes forever to show up. Thanks for the suggestion, though!"
2012-06-20T14:13:23-0700,"Finally had time to play it, and it is lots of fun! I am so happy to have Eevee as my starter."
2012-06-20T21:19:55-0700,I'm sure you are JewelQuest. I might try to get it myself and hope that I can get Jigglypuff early game.
2012-06-21T04:10:47-0700,Early game? You get it on the first battle automatically.
2012-06-21T12:49:30-0700,What he said. lol.
2012-06-23T15:40:51-0700,"JIGGLYPUFF AWESOMENESS TIME!!!!Thank you Pokemon Conquest, I love you."
2012-07-08T16:24:57-0700,"Ok...has anyone else been having problems even finding Pokemon Conquest in stores? I figured I'd go ahead and get it this week to enjoy with the holiday in the middle and all, but I couldn't find the bloody game in any store. Walmart, Gamestop, ToysRUs, Best Buy, all of them were sold out. I mean, did they just underproduce Conquest? Because this is the first time in many years I've ever had problems finding any videogame in stock, and Pokemon spinoff games have never been this popular..."
2012-07-08T16:30:42-0700,"Must be underproduced or just did unexpectedly well, because apparently even Amazon is starting to run low."
2012-07-08T18:32:16-0700,"Yep, I had the same problem. I had to call about 6 different Gamestops, 3 different Best Buys, 2 different Targets, and 2 TRUs before I found a copy. Thankfully, it was a Used copy. At Gamestop. $27 Conquest is amazing.Maybe we should start putting in Support tickets? Maybe then they'll see that they have a potential Platinum game on their hands, and they should make more of them?"
2012-07-08T19:25:24-0700,i Agree with the amazing part i Totally misjudged it great spin offanyone catch the region land is an a shape of a pokemon?
2012-07-09T13:04:11-0700,"Yeah, my sister pointed that out. I was like: Really? *Looks*I am loving my game. I finished the main story, but I can't seem to get any where in the others. It's rather irritating."
2012-07-09T13:12:04-0700,"Try evolving a warlord's Pokemon in one story to make it easier in another. For example, in the main story, I evolved Motochika's Oshawott all the way to Samurott and registered it in the gallery. Therefore, I started Motochika's story with a Samurott. Also, Guardian Charms are very powerful. One of my favorite tactics is to attack a full nation with a single strong Pokemon that has good matchuos and a Guardian Charm. It gives large amounts of link. I beat Mitsuhide's level before 2 years passed using that strategy."
2012-07-09T13:26:43-0700,Do i have to register the pokemon or something? what do you mean registering them?
2012-07-09T13:29:11-0700,"Use the warrior in a battle. The game then registers them into your warrior gallery.I know if you evolve a warlord, you have to register again. Not sure about new linked Pokemon or when Pokemon evolve."
2012-07-10T12:40:49-0700,"I am doing the Lightning gal's storyline....Ginchyo or something like that. I used her a lot in my main storyline so she does have a Luxray, as well as a Prinplup that that grabbed when I needed a Water type at one point. But I like Joltik(had Oichi play through with that instead of Jigglypuff), and she had one, so I had her use it instead. It might have been easier if I used Luxray....Lol.I prefer to get as many warriors as possible and beat them up with those. I love battling in Puglis, though, it's battlefield rocks.But I finally beat up Ranmaru and got four kingdoms of my own.Now, if I can beat up No...."
2012-07-10T12:44:42-0700,"Pugillis and Avia are awesome. I fended off Kenshin's Gallade in Pugillis with only a Magikarp, and in Avia, used Gracia and her Gothita against Nobunaga's Hydreigon and won."
2012-07-10T12:49:07-0700,"I lol'd at the Magikarp. That must have been...interesting.I usually have my Emolga in Pugillis(Or at least a couple flying types) because then I get knocked off, I get right back up.At the moment I can't remember which kingdom Avia is.........I had to restart the Lightning girl's storyline once because Ranmaru's army got too strong for me to defeat...At least I would be able to defeat it if they would give me five minutes peace. ;/"
2012-07-10T12:53:28-0700,Flying type. Avia is flying type.Magikarp and Gallade both have 3 range and the A.I. can be tricked. I had the Magikarp running from banner to banner clockwise with Gallade a banner behind until time ran out.
2012-07-10T12:56:20-0700,Do you guys know how to unlock nabunagas story?
2012-07-10T12:57:23-0700,"Beat 9 other stories, I think."
2012-07-10T21:17:39-0700,"That works.When protecting Crystellia, I usually have Elmoga fly into the water corner and wait their until time runs out...provided that the attackers don't have a flying type that I'm weak to and that none of their moves can hit be from where I am."
2012-07-12T18:57:25-0700,"Protip: If you want one of the Warlords, you have to beat them with one of your own Warlords, under the same restrictions that you get one of your soldiers. Early game, that's damn near impossible. And it doesn't really get any easier until you get some Warlords under your wing. There might be some that you just get through the story, but I don't know about those guys yet."
2012-07-12T19:56:41-0700,"^I think you get Mister Rhyperrior and Gallade in the story, and that's it. They are the ones who get a cut scene. Additionally, i don't believe you can get any Warlords who fight you with Nobunaga at the end (Mr. Infernape, Mismagius, Lapras, Aggron as i recall, maybe more) until post story."
2012-07-12T21:57:51-0700,While you can't get anyone after Kenshin and Shingen (the two you mentioned) all the warlords from before that wander around after you beat them if they didn't join you.
2012-07-13T04:26:25-0700,The WiFi event where you get Motonari and Motochika automatically helps a lot with getting other Warlords.
2012-07-13T05:56:35-0700,I beat 9 other stories but i still dont have him
2012-07-13T18:07:40-0700,"Quick random question: How do you start one of those downloaded episodes? Specifically, the Motonari & Motochika episode. No, I haven't beaten the game yet. I'm just trying to get a couple of actual Warlords, rather than the ton of Grunts I've picked up thus far..."
2012-07-13T19:31:44-0700,"Motonari and Motochika automatically join your team, but only in the main story. As for the additional episodes they automatically unlock once you beat the game and will be found on the last page.Also most of the warlords (as well as some rank ups) aren't available until you start playing the extra stories."
2012-07-13T21:01:01-0700,"Well I finally managed to hold a copy at ToysRUs, couldn't buy it since their system was down and for whatever reason they couldn't ring it up since it has the $10 giftcard you have to have rang up at the same time...so yeah, tomorrow thoughProbably spend the giftcard on cards or something."
2012-07-14T02:23:06-0700,"Except that they, y'know, haven't. Yes, I've downloaded the episode. I kinda need them so that I even have half a shot at recruiting the Shinx chick, who randomly showed up on my radar this month."
2012-07-14T08:41:43-0700,"Not to downplay the regular games, but I'm enjoying this way more than B/W, HG/SS, etc.I hope they make a 2nd one with more Pokemon..."
2012-07-14T13:43:02-0700,"I got Ginchyo pretty easily....She is one of the earliest ones you can get, so she isn't all that tough."
2012-07-14T14:13:14-0700,"The tough part is really positioning. It's rather difficult to recruit properly when you've only got two guys that can potentially recruit her (Eevee and Jiggly). Plus, trying to recruit the 2 guys with her as well. It's rather annoying..."
2012-07-14T15:05:07-0700,":/ Good point. Though I sort of gave up on both Eevee and Jigglypuff half way through, as they didn't do enough damage and I didn't want Eevee to evolve...That was before I knew that I could stop them from evolving."
2012-07-14T15:23:23-0700,"Don't know why they haven't. My best advice is to double check that you downloaded it. Beyond that I don't know why they haven't, since they joined automatically.In any case if you're having a hard time with Ginchyo you could wait until after you get Shingen and Kenshin since they automatically come with Rhyperior and Gallade."
2012-07-14T17:27:07-0700,"Ok so I just got the game, guess I have one question...I see all these things about recruiting and such...is everything basically repeatable until you can recruit everything? For example, I've never been a fan of having to restart or anything just because I miss something near the start or midway through the game that I can't get later on."
2012-07-14T17:36:50-0700,"Thus far, I've fought the Shinx warlord twice. My biggest problem is that I'm out of space to store my plebs. And I think that might be the reason why I'm having problems recruiting the Shinx warlord.It looks like there's a spire in the Electric Kingdom that lets you summon random Pokemon and Warriors based on a set Wisdom stat. I'm not certain how often you can use it, but it's there, and it's most certainly usable to pick up some guys you might have missed early on.I'm actually quite enjoying that there's no good FAQ out there for this game yet. It's something I haven't experienced in a long, long time. I'm hoping I finish before the complete FAQs can be released. That would be spectacular.Does the download take a month to work? Like, do I have to wait a month before those two decide to join me or something like that?"
2012-07-14T19:46:26-0700,"Once you've beaten the main story you're given several episodes to choose from that focus on a specific warlord. During these you're able to re-recruit any warriors/warlords you got previously and they'll have their old Pokemon. (their link % won't carry over) You can also go out and recruit Pokemon that were previously inaccessible by upgrading facilities via the bank.So a lot of stuff is repeatable, except the main story. (Don't worry you can get your main character back)Hope that helps.If you've run out of room you can select a full kingdom and kick someone out, or wait until you have more kingdoms under your command.As for the warlords, they probably activate a month later, the passwords work like that as well."
2012-07-14T19:58:08-0700,"Yep, they activated the next month. Actually, they're going to be a HUGE boon to my army, especially this month when I take their Chingling and Ralts into the Fighting kingdom. It's not a perfect army, and it's not as powerful as the one I'm facing, but I've now got type advantage with 3 Psychics, a Flying, and 2 Fires to counter their 4 pure Fightings and a pure Grass. This one will be GOOD."
2012-07-14T22:05:57-0700,"I guess another question...all these downloadable events, are they like repeatable or what? I'm not too clear on how they work..."
2012-07-14T23:31:44-0700,"Other than Motochika and Motonari (as they get added to your team in the main story), all the downloadable episodes are repeatable as are all the bonus episodes. You'll find them on the last page once you beat the game."
2012-07-15T18:18:26-0700,"I just got Pokemon Conquest a few hours ago and I'm liking it. In fact, I'm about to try and take over the Kingdom of Fontaine. I hope Jigglypuff survives."
2012-07-15T18:36:44-0700,"Water? Not too terrible. It gets worse. Much, much worse. And, also, strangely better. Right now, my biggest problem is that I'm out of room to collect new Warlords. And that's annoying me no end, as I've got to recruit the clown mime guy right now, and I've got no space left to grab him..."
2012-07-15T20:00:45-0700,You can run out of room to recruit people? Better make a note of that...is there a way to ditch warriors you've already recruited then?
2012-07-15T20:50:34-0700,"Sadly, I don't think there is a way to ditch warriors after you recruit them, But you can reject recruits."
2012-07-16T01:20:47-0700,"Yes you can. Once you've recruited the warrior, select a full kingdom and it will ask you to dismiss a warrior."
2012-07-16T04:33:20-0700,That annoyed me beyond anything. Why is there a limit to my recruiting?!? That's by far and away the most interesting part of the game (to me at least)! Why can't I just stash guys in something similar to a PC box or something? Why can't I get every Grunt that I come across? I had to ditch one of my earliest recruits because I needed a Warlord and this guy was weak.
2012-07-16T05:33:12-0700,Is this game worth buying? I've read reviews about how little gameplay / replay value there is.
2012-07-16T12:26:44-0700,It is the game I have played the most out of all of my games.
2012-07-16T14:20:13-0700,Who cares about replay value when there's about 30 hours of post-game material in addition to the 20+ hours of regular game material?There's always a good bit of RNG manipulation. Each battle is nearly randomly-generated as far as initial position. So no two battles are ever exactly alike.
2012-07-16T15:58:45-0700,"You've read some pretty inaccurate reviews... There are few games with more replay than this - especially if you take time to work on perfect links, evolving, and get into the multiplayer.I'd like to see a Risk-style multiplayer version of this game, though, where you and your opponents fight to control the Ransei region."
2012-07-17T08:10:43-0700,Heck I'd like to see tournament support for this more than the actual VG lol
2012-07-17T17:07:46-0700,"If there were more moves for each Pokemon, then I'd agree with you. But, as it currently stands, the game is all about type advantage and positioning. I'd like to see more variety in what you can do with your teams, especially given that the entire metagame would devolve to the same 20-ish Warlords and 40-ish Pokemon. There is so much that you could potentially do with this game, both on a casual and competitive level, that it would be a fantastic OP opportunity. But the current iteration? Not quite there yet...BTW, I'm now using Excel spreadsheets and Word to better organize my stuff and get my Perfect Links all taken care of. Bidoof sucks."
2012-07-17T19:40:38-0700,I think it would come down to personal preferences on Warlords. Even with only one attack type you're limited to six war lords and six Pokemon. I could see trying to make the best of what you have.
2012-07-17T19:45:27-0700,"I for one agree with Bullados. There are certain warlords that simply tower over others (Kenshin's Inspiration anyone), and many Pokemon are easily better than others (specifically legendaries). Which is all the more reason why we should have a sequel IMO."
2012-07-18T11:47:25-0700,Still waiting for it over here
2012-06-23T15:40:51-0700,"JIGGLYPUFF AWESOMENESS TIME!!!!Thank you Pokemon Conquest, I love you."

For example, I've never been a fan of having to restart or anything just because I miss something near the start or midway through the game that I can't get later on."
2012-07-14T17:36:50-0700,"Thus far, I've fought the Shinx warlord twice. My biggest problem is that I'm out of space to store my plebs. And I think that might be the reason why I'm having problems recruiting the Shinx warlord.It looks like there's a spire in the Electric Kingdom that lets you summon random Pokemon and Warriors based on a set Wisdom stat. I'm not certain how often you can use it, but it's there, and it's most certainly usable to pick up some guys you might have missed early on.I'm actually quite enjoying that there's no good FAQ out there for this game yet. It's something I haven't experienced in a long, long time. I'm hoping I finish before the complete FAQs can be released. That would be spectacular.Does the download take a month to work? Like, do I have to wait a month before those two decide to join me or something like that?"
2012-07-14T19:46:26-0700,"Once you've beaten the main story you're given several episodes to choose from that focus on a specific warlord. During these you're able to re-recruit any warriors/warlords you got previously and they'll have their old Pokemon. (their link % won't carry over) You can also go out and recruit Pokemon that were previously inaccessible by upgrading facilities via the bank.So a lot of stuff is repeatable, except the main story. (Don't worry you can get your main character back)Hope that helps.If you've run out of room you can select a full kingdom and kick someone out, or wait until you have more kingdoms under your command.As for the warlords, they probably activate a month later, the passwords work like that as well."
2012-07-14T19:58:08-0700,"Yep, they activated the next month. Actually, they're going to be a HUGE boon to my army, especially this month when I take their Chingling and Ralts into the Fighting kingdom. It's not a perfect army, and it's not as powerful as the one I'm facing, but I've now got type advantage with 3 Psychics, a Flying, and 2 Fires to counter their 4 pure Fightings and a pure Grass. This one will be GOOD."
2012-07-14T22:05:57-0700,"I guess another question...all these downloadable events, are they like repeatable or what? I'm not too clear on how they work..."
2012-07-14T23:31:44-0700,"Other than Motochika and Motonari (as they get added to your team in the main story), all the downloadable episodes are repeatable as are all the bonus episodes. You'll find them on the last page once you beat the game."
2012-07-15T18:18:26-0700,"I just got Pokemon Conquest a few hours ago and I'm liking it. In fact, I'm about to try and take over the Kingdom of Fontaine. I hope Jigglypuff survives."
2012-07-15T18:36:44-0700,"Water? Not too terrible. It gets worse. Much, much worse. And, also, strangely better. Right now, my biggest problem is that I'm out of room to collect new Warlords. And that's annoying me no end, as I've got to recruit the clown mime guy right now, and I've got no space left to grab him..."
2012-07-15T20:00:45-0700,You can run out of room to recruit people? Better make a note of that...is there a way to ditch warriors you've already recruited then?
2012-07-15T20:50:34-0700,"Sadly, I don't think there is a way to ditch warriors after you recruit them, But you can reject recruits."
2012-07-16T01:20:47-0700,"Yes you can. Once you've recruited the warrior, select a full kingdom and it will ask you to dismiss a warrior."
2012-07-16T04:33:20-0700,That annoyed me beyond anything. Why is there a limit to my recruiting?!? That's by far and away the most interesting part of the game (to me at least)! Why can't I just stash guys in something similar to a PC box or something? Why can't I get every Grunt that I come across? I had to ditch one of my earliest recruits because I needed a Warlord and this guy was weak.
2012-07-16T05:33:12-0700,Is this game worth buying? I've read reviews about how little gameplay / replay value there is.
2012-07-16T12:26:44-0700,It is the game I have played the most out of all of my games.
2012-07-16T14:20:13-0700,Who cares about replay value when there's about 30 hours of post-game material in addition to the 20+ hours of regular game material?There's always a good bit of RNG manipulation. Each battle is nearly randomly-generated as far as initial position. So no two battles are ever exactly alike.
2012-07-16T15:58:45-0700,"You've read some pretty inaccurate reviews... There are few games with more replay than this - especially if you take time to work on perfect links, evolving, and get into the multiplayer.I'd like to see a Risk-style multiplayer version of this game, though, where you and your opponents fight to control the Ransei region."
2012-07-17T08:10:43-0700,Heck I'd like to see tournament support for this more than the actual VG lol
2012-07-17T17:07:46-0700,"If there were more moves for each Pokemon, then I'd agree with you. But, as it currently stands, the game is all about type advantage and positioning. I'd like to see more variety in what you can do with your teams, especially given that the entire metagame would devolve to the same 20-ish Warlords and 40-ish Pokemon. There is so much that you could potentially do with this game, both on a casual and competitive level, that it would be a fantastic OP opportunity. But the current iteration? Not quite there yet...BTW, I'm now using Excel spreadsheets and Word to better organize my stuff and get my Perfect Links all taken care of. Bidoof sucks."
2012-07-17T19:40:38-0700,I think it would come down to personal preferences on Warlords. Even with only one attack type you're limited to six war lords and six Pokemon. I could see trying to make the best of what you have.
2012-07-17T19:45:27-0700,"I for one agree with Bullados. There are certain warlords that simply tower over others (Kenshin's Inspiration anyone), and many Pokemon are easily better than others (specifically legendaries). Which is all the more reason why we should have a sequel IMO."
2012-07-18T11:47:25-0700,Still waiting for it over here
2012-07-13T05:56:35-0700,I beat 9 other stories but i still dont have him
2012-07-13T18:07:40-0700,"Quick random question: How do you start one of those downloaded episodes? Specifically, the Motonari & Motochika episode. No, I haven't beaten the game yet. I'm just trying to get a couple of actual Warlords, rather than the ton of Grunts I've picked up thus far..."
2012-07-13T19:31:44-0700,"Motonari and Motochika automatically join your team, but only in the main story. As for the additional episodes they automatically unlock once you beat the game and will be found on the last page.Also most of the warlords (as well as some rank ups) aren't available until you start playing the extra stories."
2012-07-13T21:01:01-0700,"Well I finally managed to hold a copy at ToysRUs, couldn't buy it since their system was down and for whatever reason they couldn't ring it up since it has the $10 giftcard you have to have rang up at the same time...so yeah, tomorrow thoughProbably spend the giftcard on cards or something."
2012-07-14T02:23:06-0700,"Except that they, y'know, haven't. Yes, I've downloaded the episode. I kinda need them so that I even have half a shot at recruiting the Shinx chick, who randomly showed up on my radar this month."
2012-07-14T08:41:43-0700,"Not to downplay the regular games, but I'm enjoying this way more than B/W, HG/SS, etc.I hope they make a 2nd one with more Pokemon..."
2012-07-14T13:43:02-0700,"I got Ginchyo pretty easily....She is one of the earliest ones you can get, so she isn't all that tough."
2012-07-14T14:13:14-0700,"The tough part is really positioning. It's rather difficult to recruit properly when you've only got two guys that can potentially recruit her (Eevee and Jiggly). Plus, trying to recruit the 2 guys with her as well. It's rather annoying..."
2012-07-14T15:05:07-0700,":/ Good point. Though I sort of gave up on both Eevee and Jigglypuff half way through, as they didn't do enough damage and I didn't want Eevee to evolve...That was before I knew that I could stop them from evolving."
2012-07-14T15:23:23-0700,"Don't know why they haven't. My best advice is to double check that you downloaded it. Beyond that I don't know why they haven't, since they joined automatically.In any case if you're having a hard time with Ginchyo you could wait until after you get Shingen and Kenshin since they automatically come with Rhyperior and Gallade."

2012-06-24T15:33:46-0700,"I think that as a player, the game should have different endings, or different paths depending on the choices you make.For example, there are 2 villainous teams. Well they aren't villainous, but each team has completely different points of view that neither of them are right nor wrong, and it is up to the player, depending on the user's point of view, on which side that player should join.One team wears tan and olive drab. The other team wears grey and black trench coats. I'll leave you to figure out the names of these 2 teams.The tan and olive drab team thinks that pokemon should be freed from trainers, much like team plasma. The grey and black trench coat team thinks that pokemon should be slaves, and that every pokemon should be owned by somebody. You have to decide which side to pick.I think this way, it teaches kids about morals, and which one seems more right than the other."
2012-06-24T16:31:41-0700,"Uh...yeah...not that people won't choose your hypothetical black side, but their views you listed kind of clash with the whole ""not right nor wrong"" part of your first statement.Having other endings or outcomes from your actions in the game could be fun though. Say for example, back in Ruby/Sapphire, they gave you the choice of joining Team Magma or Aqua; with Magma, most of the sea paths post-E4 and water Pokemon could be gone and the map reflective of it. Or should you side with Aqua, most of the land would be gone and replaced with more water Pokemon and sea lanes. And then you can open up new Pokemon that are migrating to these ""new"" areas as well."
2012-06-24T16:37:59-0700,"I think Black/White did the series a favor in allowing the use of HMs the second you find/get them. Disconnecting them from the gym badge requirement was a good idea.What I hope to see in the next generation of Pokemon games is an open world I can explore from the beginning. Every game is so linear, where you have to follow the path, go from this area to this area to this area. Only in certain places can you actually choose to go in another direction, which is usually blocked by a stupid NPC or a need for an HM (surf, strength, etc). I'd like to see a world where there are no NPCs that stop you, there are few HM blocking terrain. If you want to go explore half the map before taking on the first gym, be my guest. Sure, if you get spotted by a trainer, you'll likely lose, but that is part of the fun of it.Also, I'd like to perhaps see zero new Pokemon in the next generation but access to all generations of Pokemon from the get-go. The game can use seasons, night/day, and day of the week to separate which Pokemon appear when. It just seems like all the games work like this: Have access to this game's Pokemon for 99% of the game, then you beat the Elite 4 and can play with the other generations for the other 1% of the game. Whoopie!Can we have access to VS Seeker, please? It was missing in Black/White and I felt it. Audino hunting was not as much fun. Can we get an upgrade after we beat the Elite 4 so we can use it on Gyms? That'd be awesome!"
2012-06-24T16:41:01-0700,"What I like to see in a dialog is not just a simple yes or no, and to continue, you have to pick yes.Another thing I would like is to be able to be the bad guy. I guess there could be 2 teams. One is good, the other bad, and you get to pick a side. Sometimes, gameplay possibilities expand if you pick the Axis or the Decepticons."
2012-06-24T21:23:56-0700,"What I'd like to see is a story that's at least as complex as Dragon Quest. And, honestly, that's a fairly low bar to try and hurdle..."
2012-07-03T13:44:26-0700,"I think they should do what they did in Yellow and give you a selection of Pokemon besides the average :grass::fire::water: set. Like Fighting, or Dark, something a little less conventional."
2012-07-03T15:41:14-0700,"Or give you a Masterball to start with, with plenty of Pokedolls (Smoke Balls) to run away from wild battles. Let YOU choose your first Pokemon."
2012-07-03T22:36:26-0700,"I think that for the 6th generation, the starter for the first set of games should be :grass::fire::water:.Then when the sequel or remake is released, the starters, which are already featured in the first game, should besychic::fighting::dark:Afterall, there is a rock paper scissors type of thing in Psychic beating Fighting beating Dark beating Psychic. They are also energy types in the TCG as well."
2012-07-04T00:41:34-0700,"Ahh... you may have something there. :wink: My fan fic would be Sewaddle, Vulpix, and Feebas(hear me out). Secondly Ralts, Riolu, and Zorua respectively.Sewaddle: Leavanny; Photo finish first with Budew (Roserade) in the Grass race in my head.Vulpix: Ninetales; I think my username explains this one. :biggrin:Feebas: Milotic; Feebas is sucky I know, but it CAN learn TMs. Plus Milotic is kinda they only Water type I like so... :tongue:Ralts: Gallade/Gardevoir; only Psychic I like that isn't a Legendary.Riolu: Lucario; C'mon. Why wouldn't he be a starter? :lol: He could be like what Pikachu is to Yellow. In Riolu's case, your faithful companion whom you form a bond with that eventually triggers Evolution. (during the day of course)Zorua: Zoroark; If you have questions, please consult my username. :biggrin:"

2012-07-12T20:30:19-0700,"1st, cut down on the legendary Pokemon. 1/2 main/title guys, a single trio are a good basis. I don't mind 1 obligatory cute legendary and 1 extra even.

I dunno how BLW2 is on this, but BLW one was kinda eh. Not the worst, but not the best. I dont like legendary hunting being the only thing to do.Finally, i'm really tired of obligatory vilanous teams. I think they can figure something out to drive the game without them. Or at least not story teams. I'd love to see a Pokemon Mystery Dugeon like bulletin board where events happen that you can interact with, and having teams attackign different regions would be a cool addition to that. But main plot could use a break from Koffinn/Zubat/Poochyenna/Glameow/Sandile spamming grunts for a while.Edit: Oh, and following Pokemon. HGSS had it and it was amazing, and then they took it away. WHY?"
2012-07-18T11:46:04-0700,"I'm super interested to see how they put it on the 3DS. They didn't mess with the formula much with 4th gen on the DS, despite the obvious chances to, with the capabilities of the handheld, not till black and white at least, so again, interested./"
2012-06-24T15:33:46-0700,"I think that as a player, the game should have different endings, or different paths depending on the choices you make.For example, there are 2 villainous teams. Well they aren't villainous, but each team has completely different points of view that neither of them are right nor wrong, and it is up to the player, depending on the user's point of view, on which side that player should join.One team wears tan and olive drab. The other team wears grey and black trench coats. I'll leave you to figure out the names of these 2 teams.The tan and olive drab team thinks that pokemon should be freed from trainers, much like team plasma. The grey and black trench coat team thinks that pokemon should be slaves, and that every pokemon should be owned by somebody. You have to decide which side to pick.I think this way, it teaches kids about morals, and which one seems more right than the other."
2012-06-24T16:31:41-0700,"Uh...yeah...not that people won't choose your hypothetical black side, but their views you listed kind of clash with the whole ""not right nor wrong"" part of your first statement.Having other endings or outcomes from your actions in the game could be fun though. Say for example, back in Ruby/Sapphire, they gave you the choice of joining Team Magma or Aqua; with Magma, most of the sea paths post-E4 and water Pokemon could be gone and the map reflective of it. Or should you side with Aqua, most of the land would be gone and replaced with more water Pokemon and sea lanes. And then you can open up new Pokemon that are migrating to these ""new"" areas as well."
2012-06-24T16:37:59-0700,"I think Black/White did the series a favor in allowing the use of HMs the second you find/get them. Disconnecting them from the gym badge requirement was a good idea.What I hope to see in the next generation of Pokemon games is an open world I can explore from the beginning. Every game is so linear, where you have to follow the path, go from this area to this area to this area. Only in certain places can you actually choose to go in another direction, which is usually blocked by a stupid NPC or a need for an HM (surf, strength, etc). I'd like to see a world where there are no NPCs that stop you, there are few HM blocking terrain. If you want to go explore half the map before taking on the first gym, be my guest. Sure, if you get spotted by a trainer, you'll likely lose, but that is part of the fun of it.Also, I'd like to perhaps see zero new Pokemon in the next generation but access to all generations of Pokemon from the get-go. The game can use seasons, night/day, and day of the week to separate which Pokemon appear when. It just seems like all the games work like this: Have access to this game's Pokemon for 99% of the game, then you beat the Elite 4 and can play with the other generations for the other 1% of the game. Whoopie!Can we have access to VS Seeker, please? It was missing in Black/White and I felt it. Audino hunting was not as much fun. Can we get an upgrade after we beat the Elite 4 so we can use it on Gyms? That'd be awesome!"
2012-06-24T16:41:01-0700,"What I like to see in a dialog is not just a simple yes or no, and to continue, you have to pick yes.Another thing I would like is to be able to be the bad guy. I guess there could be 2 teams. One is good, the other bad, and you get to pick a side. Sometimes, gameplay possibilities expand if you pick the Axis or the Decepticons."
2012-06-24T21:23:56-0700,"What I'd like to see is a story that's at least as complex as Dragon Quest. And, honestly, that's a fairly low bar to try and hurdle..."
2012-07-03T13:44:26-0700,"I think they should do what they did in Yellow and give you a selection of Pokemon besides the average :grass::fire::water: set. Like Fighting, or Dark, something a little less conventional."
2012-07-03T15:41:14-0700,"Or give you a Masterball to start with, with plenty of Pokedolls (Smoke Balls) to run away from wild battles. Let YOU choose your first Pokemon."
2012-07-03T22:36:26-0700,"I think that for the 6th generation, the starter for the first set of games should be :grass::fire::water:.Then when the sequel or remake is released, the starters, which are already featured in the first game, should besychic::fighting::dark:Afterall, there is a rock paper scissors type of thing in Psychic beating Fighting beating Dark beating Psychic. They are also energy types in the TCG as well."

2012-07-15T01:21:49-0700,"In the most recent issue of Coro Coro, Genesect was finally revealed and confirmed to be part of the next movie, and will be distributed next month.What's everyone's opinions on this early reveal? What do you think this means for the movie, and how do you think this will affect Pokemon's plans for between now and the next generation?SOURCE:http://bulbanews.bulbagarden.net/wiki/CoroCoro_August_issue_reveals_'Genesect'"
2012-07-15T07:57:20-0700,"It's my firm belief, that the reason the Events were rushed out by Nintendo so quickly this Gen. Is the same reason we've yet to get a Storage Game (Stadium, Box, Ranch) or a 3-D Battler (Stadium, Colosseum, Battle Revolution), and why we probably won't get that Ruby Sapphire remake.Their trying to rush through this Generation as fast as possible, so they can to the fancy, shiny new 3DS powered 6th Gen.That they've no doubt been working on since before the release of Black and White."
2012-07-15T11:03:57-0700,"I'm not sure how it's early, don't they usually start hyping the next unrevealed one around the time the current movie comes out?So it'll just go through the same cycle, once the Genesect movie is out, likely some 6th gen Pokemon will make an appearance. I think this is squeezing out any RS remake though unless they go like the sequel route and put new 6th gen Pokemon there instead."
2012-07-16T01:20:49-0700,Genesect will be a 3DS Pokemon game cart release at the rate we get any of the hundreds of unavailable download/special Pokemon that Japan receives.Meh.............. not complaining- just considering the way things eventually make their way over here VG wise is all.
2012-07-16T05:35:31-0700,I wonder if Genesect will be a catchable Pokemon in Black 2 White 2!
2012-07-16T06:39:22-0700,"Zero chance, unless it's connected to an event only item like, Victini and the Liberty Pass."
2012-07-16T10:19:53-0700,What I can't get over is how Japan has all three and we don't even have news of the first one.

The only downside is both devices frown upon restarting or replaying the games.On the Pokemon Global Link, each person registers their Black and/or White cartridges so that the network can identify them. When a player restarts either of their games, and reconnects back to the system, they are given a new code to put into PGL, but PGL does not give you a way to delete an old code and/or replace it with a new one. From the research I've found, you have to contact Nintendo Customer Support and request them to delete your old code.This puts a huge deterrence on people restarting games. If you don't jump through Nintendo's hoops, you literally have no access to the PGL on that cartridge.Using the PokeWalker, it is registered to a trainer ID #. This makes sure it is transferring information to and from the right trainer. If you restart your game, your ID # changes, meaning that you have to reset your PokeWalker, losing all the progress you've made in unlocking new areas or step milestones.At least with the latter system, it is possible to fix it in your own time, but both systems put a huge deterrence on players to restart their games. Why is this? The Pokemon games only have 1 save file.I love to restart my games. I'd almost say I am a restart-a-holic. I like having one game as the base, and then restarting another and transferring the Pokemon to the base game, and starting over against. This allows me to try out different Pokemon through the gym system, which I find the most fun.Why did Nintendo design their two latest Pokemon promotions and contraptions to be like this? What were they thinking?"
2012-06-24T08:02:52-0700,"I can tell you why - exclusives. The PGL has events where you get special pokemon, like the arceus and the birthday togekiss. They want these to remain exclusive otherwise it loses all meaning. What is the point of having events if people can freely just reset and get more and more. It decreases the overall value of the pokemon.If everybody got the ability to freely restart and gain access to the exclusives again and again, people would start to think ""What's the point"".Most people restart their game to replay the story and the PGL and pokewalker add absolutely nothing to the story. If you know you are going reset your game, you should know not to link it to the PGL. They specifically warn you that the link is between the game and your logon. If you don't read the warnings then that is user error not nintendo.I restart my games as well - currently going through Ruby again myself. But I keep at least one game complete in each generation to ensure that everything I have worked hard for is still around."

I'd only play one of them. The other thing is they are now releasing wonder cards for each game AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT!!! I tend to favor 1 game of the series. The one with the most hours on it and now I have to play White so I can get the movie Zekrom? Would it be wrong to say that I own Black and have a rom for White?2. Stop making games for the DS. The 3DS has been out for almost a year now. BW2 should be on the 3DS. Reasons are they can still develop for it and release it as a update for the game. You want to add a new area, don't make a new game. Just make the area and release it in the shop channel. 5 bucks and you get new game content. If they want it, they will get it. I know I will.3. They are making a 3DS XL. Really?! It's such a pain moving all content from 1 DS to another. Not only does it take time, but it messes up every game in the process because the games saves data to that DS and if it can't find them, it clears all setting to register with the new host DS.For Gamefreak and Nintendo to be innovators, they are living in dark times.

2012-06-24T12:13:54-0700,"Well let's remember the whole basis on why there are 2 versions, it is to encourage trading and interaction between people with different carts (and on another note, to give the GB more use of its new link cable way back in 1996). There is no reason to buy both versions considering you can trade, granted if you have absolutely no one around you to trade with locally that used to be an issue, but even now we have wifi to trade. And very few things absolutely need trading to unlock, like Landorus (needing both Tornadus and Thundrus). I mean, if you really want both wondercards for an event, well it's your prerogative to buy both carts then, as most probably do fine with just one.Likely BW2 was already well into development for the DS anyways, why stop it to have to remodel things into 3d? Given how bad sales of the 3DS were at first also, the conversion probably wasn't cost/time effective, and at any rate besides a faster engine, 3d is still just a gimmick largely...that being said, they already have exclusive features in BW2 for 3DS users anyways like that AR thing to catch the incarnate forms of the djinn trio and other Pokemon. Gen 6 will all but be for 3DS anyways by the time it comes out so they're not behind them times realistically (besides lacking another Wii title, BW doesn't work very well with PBR).I'm not really sure what the 3DS XL has to do with anything, I don't envision most people ditching their regular 3DS for one that is far more cumbersome to use unless you have the really big hands.

It's also annoying that I have to buy and play through BOTH copies of the game released (B2 and W2) so I have access to everything. Its bad because that's 70 bucks to a game. I'd only play one of them. The other thing is they are now releasing wonder cards for each game AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT!!! I tend to favor 1 game of the series. The one with the most hours on it and now I have to play White so I can get the movie Zekrom? Would it be wrong to say that I own Black and have a rom for White?2. Stop making games for the DS. The 3DS has been out for almost a year now. BW2 should be on the 3DS. Reasons are they can still develop for it and release it as a update for the game. You want to add a new area, don't make a new game. Just make the area and release it in the shop channel. 5 bucks and you get new game content. If they want it, they will get it. I know I will.3. They are making a 3DS XL. Really?! It's such a pain moving all content from 1 DS to another. Not only does it take time, but it messes up every game in the process because the games saves data to that DS and if it can't find them, it clears all setting to register with the new host DS.For Gamefreak and Nintendo to be innovators, they are living in dark times. Well, that ends my little rant."
2012-06-24T12:13:54-0700,"Well let's remember the whole basis on why there are 2 versions, it is to encourage trading and interaction between people with different carts (and on another note, to give the GB more use of its new link cable way back in 1996). There is no reason to buy both versions considering you can trade, granted if you have absolutely no one around you to trade with locally that used to be an issue, but even now we have wifi to trade. And very few things absolutely need trading to unlock, like Landorus (needing both Tornadus and Thundrus). I mean, if you really want both wondercards for an event, well it's your prerogative to buy both carts then, as most probably do fine with just one.Likely BW2 was already well into development for the DS anyways, why stop it to have to remodel things into 3d? Given how bad sales of the 3DS were at first also, the conversion probably wasn't cost/time effective, and at any rate besides a faster engine, 3d is still just a gimmick largely...that being said, they already have exclusive features in BW2 for 3DS users anyways like that AR thing to catch the incarnate forms of the djinn trio and other Pokemon. Gen 6 will all but be for 3DS anyways by the time it comes out so they're not behind them times realistically (besides lacking another Wii title, BW doesn't work very well with PBR).I'm not really sure what the 3DS XL has to do with anything, I don't envision most people ditching their regular 3DS for one that is far more cumbersome to use unless you have the really big hands. And even then, it's just a day's wait to get back onto DW and such moving from one DS to another right?"
2012-06-24T13:35:50-0700,I want to be able to restart the games so that I can work on my speed run strategies...
2012-06-24T14:43:23-0700,"You can restart your game and get the event Pokemon over wifi easily. Nothing stops that. I did that just recently with Darkrai. Got one of my Black, one on my White, restarted by Black, and got another.I think the PokeWalker and PGL enhance the game so much because the choices for Pokemon are low half way through the game, until you get surf. So, being able to utilize other Pokemon from outside the game (Dream World or PokeWalker) gives you more options. Personally, I prefer to get them this way than trading them over."
2012-06-28T20:27:09-0700,"I can't find the link right now, but an interview with the game designers specifically brought this up, and they answered it pretty definitively. They said that the reason it's for the DS is because the first ones were, and these are sequels. They didn't want people to be forced to buy a new system to continue the storyline. And honestly, with the amount of new stuff they put into B2W2, the Dream Radar, and the Dream World expansions, I don't feel like we've gotten the raw end of the deal here. Had they made the sequels for the 3DS, a lot of people would have been mad that they had to upgrade in order to keep the story flowing.Also, on the exclusivity thing, I know that when they were giving out events through Gamestop and Toys R Us there were people who would sit in the shop (or in the parking lot just inside range) and restart, transfer over, restart, transfer over, countless times. People farmed those events like you wouldn't believe. Now, there have been some changes that make this harder to do: Most events are Wi-fi now, and you can't trade until you get the first badge. So the farming has to some extent been reduced, but it used to be a huge thing."
2012-07-03T14:00:11-0700,"When I buy the newest Pokemon game I DO both versions but not at the same time. I buy the I favore more based on version exclusive content among other reasons, play through once, start a new game which usually ends being permanent. Then after a while I buy the other version for replay value."
2012-07-06T22:02:55-0700,I normally do buy both versions except for B and W because they are pry my least favorite. Also why no Conquest on 3DS?
2012-06-28T07:29:39-0700,"The character limit kinda helps here, because..."

2012-06-28T17:46:55-0700,I am running Utah's biggest VG tournament ONE WEEK after the release of Black & White 2. I hope this doesn't cause any issues with the tournament (like connectivity between BW & BW2)
2012-06-28T21:57:34-0700,"Simplest thing would be just to ban BW2 carts, if it'll be out for a mere week before your tourney, you put a big disadvantage to anyone not able to buy it.That being said, regarding move tutor stuff, up to you to call as quite a few of them could be egg moves normally too."
2012-06-28T23:20:21-0700,"I wouldn't expect that BW2's release is going to be that much of an issue for tournaments at release time. Unless the mass majority of players mad cram to convert over- I highly doubt that most people will have a cartridge right away as well.People like me, Ulti, Regi- sure- we'll crunch time, but here in Oregon for tournaments we give a ""grace period"" before allowing the new games into tournaments to be fair."
2012-06-29T06:06:15-0700,Quick question: If it's a sequel shouldn't you start with the same hero/heroine in Black & White?
2012-06-29T07:16:18-0700,What I am going to do is test connectivity to ensure that they can connect together (theyright?). If that isn't an issue then I will check to see if the new genie forms will connect between B/W and B2/W2.
2012-06-29T10:37:46-0700,I believe they can connect (think Platinum and DP). Not sure about the formes.
2012-06-29T13:19:49-0700,It's a sequel from a different point of view. Like how Episodes 4/5/6 are sequels to 1/2/3 but from a different characters (Luke/Han/Leia instead of Anakin/Obi Wan). A continuation of the story.

And, in the page's Game Sync World Records section, players can view how countries around the world rank in different game stats, including top cycling locations, top healing locations, top battling locations, and more. The new My Page section will make it easier to track your own game's progress and statistics, including personal reports like Global Battle Union results, Global Trade Station trades, and more.A brand-new area in the Pokémon Dream World has also arrived. Pokémon Black Version and Pokémon White Version video game players can now tuck in their favorite Pokémon and explore the new Icy Cave area. In the Icy Cave, players can meet Ice-type Pokémon such as Sneasel, Spheal, and Swinub, and bring them back into their copy of Pokémon Black Version or Pokémon White Version. Also new to the Pokémon Dream World, players have more control over which Island of Dreams area they visit, based on the type of Pokémon they have tucked in. For instance, players can give themselves a better chance at arriving in the new Icy Cave area by tucking in an Ice-type Pokémon.When the Pokémon Black Version 2 and Pokémon White Version 2 video games launch this fall, only players of the new titles will be able to meet Unova region Pokémon in the Pokémon Dream World and bring them back into their copy of the game. More Pokémon Global Link features for the Pokémon Black Version 2 and Pokémon White Version 2 games will be announced later this year.To celebrate the relaunch of the Pokémon Global Link, Pokémon Black Version and Pokémon White Version players can receive a Porygon for their game and other special Porygon-themed items via the Pokémon Global Link beginning July 12th! Specific details on how to participate will be announced onwww.pokemon.comwhen this special promotion kicks off.To participate in the promotion, players must have a free Pokémon Trainer Club account, a Nintendo 3DS or a Nintendo DS system, and a copy of the Pokémon Black Version or Pokémon White Version video game with its Game Sync ID registered at the Pokémon Global Link website.For more information about the Pokémon Global Link, please visitwww.pokemon.com/pgl.About PokémonThe Pokémon Company International, a subsidiary of The Pokémon Company in Japan, manages the property outside of Asia and is responsible for brand management, licensing, marketing, the Pokémon Trading Card Game, the animated TV series, home entertainment, and the official Pokémon website.

2012-06-25T14:11:03-0700,This is great news.
2012-06-25T18:26:39-0700,"One new area is all I read >.>I want to know the full list of Pokemon in Icy Cave first, but I'm not overtly thrilled if it's an Ice type theme personally...then again, all the ones I really want like Eevee (DW female) and Speed Boost Torchic were promos more or less anywaysWhy does Japan never show us love with the promos, it's seriously tempting to get a Japanese cart in the future just to not miss out on them."
2012-06-25T18:27:55-0700,The best feature is that the Type of the Pokemon you upload influences where you go!
2012-06-25T22:10:17-0700,That makes a lot of sense!
2012-06-26T19:33:34-0700,Ugh. I see the metagame taking a HUGE turn.It has been revealed by serebii that Ditto with the Imposter ability is available in the hidden hollows.In case you don't know what Imposter does - it allows Ditto to transform the instant it comes onto the field. No more wasting a turn to use the move.
2012-06-26T20:43:57-0700,Does ditto copy the IV/EV/Nature of the pokemon it copies?
2012-06-11T16:56:32-0700,from serebii.netso what are your thoughts about this
2012-06-11T18:23:18-0700,"Lame, I want all the shiny ubers Japan keeps getting, like that charcoal black RayquazaBut meh, guess I'll catch the one finally on my cart, then re-download and get another. Have 1 special sweeper and 1 physical I guess."
2012-06-11T18:29:00-0700,"^I do not think that your cartridge can have a second download on it. Unless there is a different ""signiture"" to this second one, one per game cartridge is all that is allowed. Or in case you have two games, then your good to go for a second one if you did not download to that one as well.Is the ""signiture"" the same or different on this extension?"
2012-06-11T18:54:59-0700,You can't download this one if you already downloaded the first one. I tried it just now.
2012-06-11T19:08:24-0700,Even if you delete whatever past wondercard data or whatever they call it before trying?Well that makes this promo kinda stink even more considering what they could be releasing instead...
2012-06-11T19:55:55-0700,It would be better if they rereleased the Victory Ticket so people can EV Train HP efficiently if they got the game late.
2012-06-11T21:11:25-0700,Regi i tried to erase the wondercard and still nothing the only way to get it to restart your gameRB I totally agree with that statement i love useing Victini in my team and evs
2012-06-13T10:08:36-0700,Happy to see it back. Last time I didn't get Victini.

2012-06-22T05:47:01-0700,"I have been watching the news on all the reveals, and all the old gen 3 & 4 legendary pokemon like Latios and cresselia are available in this game.Also the amount of hidden abilities available are nice too."
2012-06-22T13:08:05-0700,"It will be nice to get a good amount of Pokemon with their hidden abilities. The move tutors being brought back is a great addition as well, time saving for those who breed.Having the Regi's and Pixies is nice, being able to obtain them again is a nice bonus.So many goodies being tossed into the mix will keep the replay value high in the future."
2012-06-23T13:26:39-0700,"As with each release of a new game, I hope they make my favorite pokemon better."
2012-06-23T13:49:06-0700,^Is wild Eevees good enough for you? And the stones are puchasable in the games.
2012-06-23T14:25:10-0700,"^ Never cared so much for wild Eevee. The Eeveelutions are only good through breeding so that's not much of a big deal for me. Now, a Vaporeon with Thunderbolt would be awesome.Maybe even give Pidgeot a useable ability because they are all bad."
2012-06-23T19:01:12-0700,"There is a hold item called ""shinning charm"" that increases the chance of encountering shiny Pokemon.There is a ""round charm"" that makes it easier for the daycare guy to find eggs easier.4 move tutors return, requiring shards to use to teach the moves."
2012-06-23T19:21:40-0700,"But the tutors really don't have anything that wasn't in Platinum/HeartGold/SoulSilver.It will make life easier on my Arbok for dark pulse now for sure and I am excited to see what the Black/White pokemon get for tutors and any move changes pokemon get, like Scizor did in Platinum:thumb:"
2012-06-24T03:01:22-0700,"^True, but at least they were nice enough to bring the tutors back. It'll be less time in the breeding department, that is for certain.I also like how they added a ""Difficulty"" setting to the games. You get keys to raise or lower the games difficulty level, and your able to pass the feature onto others. This will add to the level of replay value so much.So much stuff they have tossed into thee next games is unbelievable, but it sure is a great answer to alot of player's ""requests"" to get the games up-to-date so that you don't have to go back through so many methods to get something simple."
2012-06-24T10:59:50-0700,I like the charms and the difficulty setting.
2012-06-25T01:19:10-0700,It looks as if there is a promising return to the berries being able to be grown. Some hidden items include the gooey mulch and other multch types in the Hidden Hallows areas. Nice! Now to go get berries from the Dreamworld.
2012-06-25T02:21:04-0700,"So B2/W2 is looking to be like Platinum, a huge improvement over the first versions? I know, different story, but has upgrades from B/W, better access to non-BW pokemon, etc. Is this the gist?"
2012-06-25T02:31:13-0700,"BW2 is more then a Platnium compliment to BW. It is turning out to be a serious up-date to unite alot of things left behind in the older games. It is a huge step in closing in a lot of the gaps caused by the game's history of crossing onto the next handheld. BW2 is also a continuation of the story on BW, things have changed, and yes- the main core of the game is there (battle the gyms, earn badges)- but with all of the goodies they are bringing back to the games onto one system is looking better and better with new additions along with branching onto the stroy line."

2012-06-18T19:32:55-0700,"First of all, this is NOT a Poll, so please do not post replies that will turn it into a Poll.With the addition to Wi-Fi downloads of Pokémon being available for the games, I would like to see a Wi-Fi event that will put a trainer into the game that has level 60+ Pokémon with a full party to battle against.True, I do like downloads of ""special Pokémon"", but I believe it would be sweet if they were to expand on the Wi-Fi opportunities that present itself as an option instead of a Pokémon.It would be awesome to have a building in the game with 50 floors that when you download a Wi-Fi event- a trainer will show up in that building that will have a full party of 6 with level 60+ who can be re-battled once a week. You'll earn money of course, and gain experience. It could be like the wonder card, and it will be permanent trainer in the game.My Question to you all is: What sort of Wi-Fi event download would you like to see in the future of Pokémon Games?"
2012-06-18T19:39:20-0700,1 of every pokemon so that way you can fill out your Pokedex
2012-06-19T02:56:46-0700,"^Interesting idea. I had a similar idea that it was a Route download. Like this:Lets say the game has 23 Routes. A wi-fi download would unlock a Route that is let's say blocked by a landslide or something of the sort that you can not travel by any means in the game. The route would be #24.The Route is already programmed into the game, but the download ""clears the path"" and adds say 5 wild Pokémon that are to appear in the grass that are Pokémon that are not so easily obtainable unless you trade ""up"" through 2 or 3 games from years ago.I have a few more ideas, but I will wait on others to post their's first."
2012-06-24T16:48:59-0700,"Swarms would go well with it. Download the newest news update about the latest swarm of pokemon and the swarm appears on your game for X days.Or like a Cruise docks into a station, and you can download the newest news update about the cruise being available for X days."
2012-06-24T16:55:15-0700,A tour guide NPC tied to the downloads system. Every week; a random route from a non-accessible region becomes the vacation destination. You can talk to that NPC and visit that route for the week. This means you only have one route in temp memory at any given time.
2012-06-24T17:39:24-0700,"In future versions include DLC for the new Pokemon formes and Pokemon for later release (like Genesect), so then we don't spoil ourselves the moment people start rummaging through the game data.Also some new locations featuring some rare Pokemon like starters, or winter only Pokemon and the like."
2012-06-24T17:47:18-0700,I'd like to be able to download miniature storylines (such as in Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky) in which you play as some other character than the actual player character. Beating one might give additional Pokedex data to help fill it out and maybe a gift Pokemon (that is special in someway) or item.

A wi-fi download would unlock a Route that is let's say blocked by a landslide or something of the sort that you can not travel by any means in the game. The route would be #24.The Route is already programmed into the game, but the download ""clears the path"" and adds say 5 wild Pokémon that are to appear in the grass that are Pokémon that are not so easily obtainable unless you trade ""up"" through 2 or 3 games from years ago.I have a few more ideas, but I will wait on others to post their's first."
2012-06-24T16:48:59-0700,"Swarms would go well with it. Download the newest news update about the latest swarm of pokemon and the swarm appears on your game for X days.Or like a Cruise docks into a station, and you can download the newest news update about the cruise being available for X days."
2012-06-24T16:55:15-0700,A tour guide NPC tied to the downloads system. Every week; a random route from a non-accessible region becomes the vacation destination. You can talk to that NPC and visit that route for the week. This means you only have one route in temp memory at any given time.
2012-06-24T17:39:24-0700,"In future versions include DLC for the new Pokemon formes and Pokemon for later release (like Genesect), so then we don't spoil ourselves the moment people start rummaging through the game data.Also some new locations featuring some rare Pokemon like starters, or winter only Pokemon and the like."
2012-06-24T17:47:18-0700,I'd like to be able to download miniature storylines (such as in Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky) in which you play as some other character than the actual player character. Beating one might give additional Pokedex data to help fill it out and maybe a gift Pokemon (that is special in someway) or item.
2012-06-18T19:32:55-0700,"First of all, this is NOT a Poll, so please do not post replies that will turn it into a Poll.With the addition to Wi-Fi downloads of Pokémon being available for the games, I would like to see a Wi-Fi event that will put a trainer into the game that has level 60+ Pokémon with a full party to battle against.True, I do like downloads of ""special Pokémon"", but I believe it would be sweet if they were to expand on the Wi-Fi opportunities that present itself as an option instead of a Pokémon.It would be awesome to have a building in the game with 50 floors that when you download a Wi-Fi event- a trainer will show up in that building that will have a full party of 6 with level 60+ who can be re-battled once a week. You'll earn money of course, and gain experience. It could be like the wonder card, and it will be permanent trainer in the game.My Question to you all is: What sort of Wi-Fi event download would you like to see in the future of Pokémon Games?"

2012-05-13T14:59:36-0700,"Pokebeach just updated with some info. Apparently, Tornadus is a bird, Thundurus is a serpent and Landorus is a jaguar (??? How does that work??)"
2012-05-13T17:42:54-0700,"Well if you remember from the speculation in that update, the trio are likely being based off aztec mythology (especially if you look at the new form shapes in depth). Tornadus is already pure flying, so if that doesn't really change, giving it the bird-like body as a ""sacred beast"" form makes sense. Cloud serpents have always been a mythological thing as well (even if it's kinda pushing it by giving Thundurus large arms and legs), though I personally would've based Thundurus off the thunderbird from northern native american mythology (even if siliglyph is based off it already). I guess Landorus is probably the one that's a bit of a stretch, as jaguars don't normally fly and it's a Ground/Flying type, so I almost suspect it's going to lose its Flying subtype, though who really knows, maybe it'll fly by ""running"" on air, guess it keeps with the theme some."

2012-05-11T10:54:09-0700,"The source also say's (not fully confirmed?) that the forms are AR search and catch.I just purchased a 3DS, and I am still checking out what all the 3DS can fully do, and downloaded the Pokedex 3D.The AR feature is really cool and fun. Looks as if Pokemon is going to get full use of the AR feature.As far as the form change, I like Uno,Dos, and Tres better- the Jinns really are silly looking before the new forms.....meh- at least the games are branching out in adding options/forms for the Pokemon, keeps the games from going stale to quickly."
2012-05-11T18:07:16-0700,"I now want BW2 even more than before, the djinn forms eh, couldn't care less unless they're an improvement (and I hope they're not female versions...creepy). But I really like the whole ""battling past gym leaders and E4"" thing, that can be awesome."
2012-05-11T19:33:16-0700,"^Agreed. The ""past gym leaders +E4"" is hopefully not set up like the last time in HG/SS where you had to track them down and wait for certain days to battle them. I hope you earn exp. from battling them.BW2 is looking to be a nice compliment to the series, with Pokemon having different forms, old feaures with new additions- looking forward to the USA release."
2012-05-11T21:07:24-0700,More scans have surfaced on Serebii.It seems that the gym leaders will be appearing in some sort of tournament. Am I the only one who would find this an awesome replacement to the Battle Frontier?
2012-05-11T23:23:15-0700,I would happily take battling gym leaders over random CPUs who have to rely on hax to win any day XD
2012-05-12T06:36:26-0700,You're just jelly of my shiny Espeon that has straight 34 IVs and 275 EVs in each slot with the ability Super Lucky.
2012-05-12T10:32:33-0700,Not really if Wonderguard Spiritomb has anything to say about it :lol:
2012-05-12T12:58:07-0700,*ahem* back on topic plz. Kthx.
2012-05-13T14:59:36-0700,"Pokebeach just updated with some info. Apparently, Tornadus is a bird, Thundurus is a serpent and Landorus is a jaguar (??? How does that work??)"
2012-05-13T17:42:54-0700,"Well if you remember from the speculation in that update, the trio are likely being based off aztec mythology (especially if you look at the new form shapes in depth). Tornadus is already pure flying, so if that doesn't really change, giving it the bird-like body as a ""sacred beast"" form makes sense. Cloud serpents have always been a mythological thing as well (even if it's kinda pushing it by giving Thundurus large arms and legs), though I personally would've based Thundurus off the thunderbird from northern native american mythology (even if siliglyph is based off it already). I guess Landorus is probably the one that's a bit of a stretch, as jaguars don't normally fly and it's a Ground/Flying type, so I almost suspect it's going to lose its Flying subtype, though who really knows, maybe it'll fly by ""running"" on air, guess it keeps with the theme some."
2012-05-13T17:52:42-0700,Is the new Tornadus wearing a bra? :/
2012-05-13T18:12:08-0700,"I think they might also be referential to the directional gods in Japan (don't remember what they're called) you know Byako (Landoru), Sieryuu? (Thundurus), Suzaku (Tornadus), and Genbu (possible trio leader next gen?). It would make sense since they're already modeled after other Japanese gods to have their alternate formes be Japanese in origin too."
2012-05-13T20:16:52-0700,I would like to ask the same thing. I hope we don't have to ask that for all of the Jinns.
2012-05-15T16:36:22-0700,"Pokemon just updated better pics of the trio. Now, I like the Landorous beast form, pretty interesting.http://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/ar_searcher/characters/"
2012-05-18T09:08:26-0700,I don't know why they would choose Aztec Mythology when the Original Kami Genies were based off Japanese mythology...Here's an article of the original Shinto Gods of Thunder and Wind...http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raijin
2012-05-18T16:01:06-0700,"^Could be for the fact that cultures inter-mix and the adoption of new beliefs is why the two are combines or related.If the Creatures/Gods are ""Ancient"", and the stories are handed down for oh, 2,000 years and found by a different culture and ""translated"" to match with the current trend/beliefs- you have a modern connection to ancient mythology.It could also be as simple as Pokémon likes to intermingle similar mythical entities to be more globally appreciated by all the fans of the games."

2012-04-28T12:18:52-0700,"@Regis: Agreed. I really would love to have a shiny 'quazza, as I does look WAY better (IMO) being black vs emerald. But, it is emerald for a reason.I also think that here in the USA the amount of WI-fi events increasing is better then going to a location to get special release Pokies that is only so far and few in the past. Nintendo made a great descision with working wi-fi into the games and what it can bring/give to the games as far as support and replay value.Even though most Pokies that are event that get released are in the banned/restricted tournement list, it is better then not having events at all. Besides, who knows what the format for 2012/13 year will bring. We might be able to use one (1) currently banned/restricted with the amount of legendaries to choose from vs the small amount to select from in the past in the next format."
2012-04-28T14:07:59-0700,hey Benzo what happened to the Wifi Events thread?and i'm exicted for this event
