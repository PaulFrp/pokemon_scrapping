2024-02-08T03:23:54+0000,"It's that time of the year again and I know lots of people are ready to move on from SV. So rumors (and obviously fake leaks) are starting to pop up like mushrooms again leading towards Pokemon Day.With SV having 'references' to Unova and Johto, it's only natural one would think we're revisitng either Gen 2 or Gen 5. Also, to isolate actual game discussion from all of this, I made this thread. Feel free to post the so-called rumors and leaks posted by your father's brother's cousin's neighbor who works at Nintendo and actually not GameFreak.--My thoughts...Personally, I just want a proper remake that adds more to what we already had, rather than stepping back (I'm looking at you BDSP). In case of Gen 2, I just want an improved HGSS. In case of Gen 5, improvements from B2W2 to be present in BW. If we're getting Legends, then just improve on what Arceus had.Graphic-wise for remakes, I am okay with Let's Go style (emphasis on art direction, not gameplay).EDIT: We've been bamboozled. We got Pokemon Z."
2024-02-08T03:35:04+0000,Whether it's Gen 2 or 5 I'm curious if they'll be any new regional forms.
2024-02-08T04:36:07+0000,If we get Legends prequels or sequels to those Gens instead of remakes then I could see more regional forms.  As well as convergent Pokemon
2024-02-08T05:18:05+0000,"Well, should there be a  game announced for 2024, it can go a number of ways:Gen II- Pokémon Legends 'Celebi'- Pokémon Let's GO JohtoGen V- Pokémon Black & White Remakes (not very likely)- Pokémon Legends 'Kyurem'Gen IXPokémon Scarlet & Violet Expansion #2Spin-OffPokkén Tournament 2New Pokémon Mystery Dungeon TitleAnd even then, I could be entirely wrong about all of these. lol"
2024-02-08T06:00:08+0000,I wonder if there’s going to be an anime based on Pokemon Legends? And if there’s going to be another special focused on Pokémon mystery dungeon with the natural voices of the Pokemon?
2024-02-08T12:09:24+0000,"My ideal wants for Pokemon Presents this year and Pokemon for the next couple years would be:Pokemon Presents 2024-Focused on all current mobile games (Masters, Unite, Cafe Remix, Sleep and GO)-SV updates (raids, mass outbreaks and mythical Pokemon events (rumour are pointing to at least one more mythical remains))-New Pokemon Mystery Dungeon game that includes Pokemon gens 7-9-Teaser trailer projects next yearPokemon Presents 2025-Quick run through on current mobile games (Masters. Unite, Cafe Remix, Sleep and GO)-Legends game set in Unova, new Unovan forms, evolutions and convergent Pokemon alike. Spring/Early Summer release.-Dual Black and Dual White which would be visually updated versions of the Let's Go games but mechanically being updated traditional Pokemon games. They would have both the plots of BW and BW2 in them and possibly a new epilogue chapter. Winter release.Pokemon Presents 2026-Quick run through on current mobile games (Masters. Unite, Cafe Remix, Sleep and GO)-Gen 10 is announced for winter release"
2024-02-08T12:47:02+0000,"Despite me wishing GF would take longer between releases I think we're going to get a core game reveal. We haven't had a proper gap year since 2015 so they're becoming increasingly uncommon, and last year had DLC instead of an actual new game.I don't really know what to expect, I'm guessing something either Johto or Unova-related, but have no idea about shape or form. Hoping for something Legends-like. I expect whatever games we get this year to also be on the Switch, regardless of when the Switch 2 actually comes out, or even is revealed.Assuming we get a Pokémon Direct, which has been the norm for a while, I expect like half of it to be dedicated to mobile games that I don't care about personally. Wouldn't be surprised if there was also some new anime seeing how many different short series we have gotten in the last few years.As for wishes, I'd love something along New Snap; a revived spin-off that gets a proper new installment on the Switch. Not really interested in old games getting rereleased if they're going to be part of the NSO Expansion Pack."
2024-02-08T13:29:27+0000,Give me BW remakes (they are perfect as is imo so I would like that with some minor upgrades like character customization)And maybe something like legends of arceus but for BW.Pass on everything else.
2024-02-08T14:20:47+0000,"Personally, the only thing I want new game-wise right now is for a Black and White 3 esque game (with the first two dropping in virtual console). Or a Legends-esque game that serve as such even without that name would work too."
2024-02-08T15:13:16+0000,"Everything feels like they're heavily hinting at Gen 2 and Gen 5 in equal measure which is a little strange. Usually, they hype the upcoming region before announcing a new remake but it's usually only one region. Even the TCG sets seem to be pointing in both directions with one set featuring Johto Pokemon and the other Unova. It would be cool if we got two games in two different regions that tell one story. Think LoZ Oracle of Ages/Seasons.What I really hope for is a Gen 5 remake that puts the story of Black and White and Black and White 2 into one, or a Black and White 3. I don't want it to be a Legends-style game."
2024-02-08T16:11:06+0000,Bringing out Gen 1 and gen 2 games onto NSO and Gen 3 onto the expansion pass. But also have them available for purchase separately.
2024-02-08T18:28:10+0000,Johto and Unova are my two favourite regions so I would be excited for either but preferably both to be revisited. They're also the only regions to not have 3D games yet.My hopes would be no remakes (any kind tbh) and for Kanto to not feature at all in a Johto game. I'm okay with a Legends style game would prefer a new story set closer in time to the original games so they can revisit the characters.
2024-02-08T18:52:39+0000,An Unovan Legends game set in the equivalent of New York in the 1920s would be cool.
2024-02-08T19:34:25+0000,In all honesty if we get a Legends game that takes place in Unova then I think they would set it in the time period with the two heroes and the original dragon.
2024-02-08T20:00:52+0000,"I think new versions of the Johto games are imminent. I don't even care if they are regular or Let's Go-style. I know many are thinking we might get Black and White 1 remakes instead. Personally, I think that if the Pokemon Company does wanna remake them during the current generation, they'll probably release in 2025 for the rumored Switch successor. As for potential re-releases of the GB, GBC and GBA mainline titles from the first three generations, given that the Pokemon Company probably doesn't want the experience to be ruined by restore points, they'll probably do a compilation title."
2024-02-08T21:33:33+0000,"I would love to be able to play remakes of  Black/White in a full scale 3D world like the Sword/Shield games, but better ofc. Keep the changes minimal and since people want to see the original dragon, they can add up stuff related to him.As for Johto remakes, the previous installments relied too much on Kanto pandering and they would benefit from adding a lot more to the story and expanding the region, but I’m actually not interesting in revisiting Johto right now."
2024-02-08T22:01:25+0000,"Assuming we are not getting a major announcement for games for the next generation the most likely stuff I think we are getting are:- Events for Scarlet/Violet and the mobile spin-offs.- If we are getting main series game announcements, likely remakes for Johto or Unova or a Legends style game.- At most just teasers for projects next year."
2024-02-08T22:16:53+0000,"I honestly find it hard to believe we are still getting anything major for the switch, so for this year and pokémon I'm think something less ambitious like a let's go title but not exactly that. I personally would love a pokémon game set in johto but with a twist, like your character not being a trainer going for gym badges but something else, just a guy solving problems around the region and maybe toppling and evil team on the way. (I'm aware that's a long shot)"
2024-02-08T22:29:22+0000,"Also, I'm curious what starters they would pick for a Legends Johto or Unova game.  I could definitely see Froakie for Johto."
2024-02-09T03:17:21+0000,"I seriously just wish we could get some new leakers like Kaka already, but it seems Khu is teasing Black and White, or he's potentially trolling. Who knows with this guy...He has been trolling more lately.I'm pretty sure there was something about a ""Paradox Unova"" and that the SV DLC would heavily tease where we're heading next, and there's no shortage of references to Unova in the DLC. I recall another post from him about Game Freak supposedly not being happy with ILCA.Anyway, just about 19 more days until Pokemon Day."
2024-02-09T04:16:38+0000,"I don't think that the next game is going to be a remake, nor do I want one."
2024-02-09T14:00:32+0000,If it does end up being in Johto or Unova doesn't bother me too much. Main thing I'd like to see is an new part of the lore explored. Legends Arceus gave interesting history to a region we already knew. I do think a legends game could be interesting as both regions have a lot of unexplored history. But even if not a legends game as long as it explores something that makes the regions feel more interesting.
2024-02-10T16:42:24+0000,"I have an internal bet with myself that the next announcements are going to be new games, either new gen or remakes… but they won’t mention what console right away. I have a nagging feeling we are seeing switch 2, or whatever it’s going to be called, later this year.  Makes me think TPC and GF have probably been working closely to maximise the switch hardware for S/V and the next incarnation will be among the first on the next console."
2024-02-10T22:29:32+0000,"It definitely won't be a new gen, since it hasn't even been two years since the Gen 9 started. Not to mention TPC will definitely wait until 2026 (the 30th anniversary) to release Gen 10.If Game Freak isn't releasing anything this year, then we're definitely getting a major spin-off. My guess is either Mystery Dungeon or a sequel to Pokkén Tournament."
2024-02-10T23:14:08+0000,I don't think they are releasing Gen 10 in 2026 because that would be a massive financial risk for Game Freak as they would essentially be delaying the entire franchise a year.
2024-02-10T23:27:56+0000,"Oh, no it won't. Game Freak and TPC aren't even close to having a financial risk, especially since the vast majority of revenue comes from merchandise, not the games.Game Freak can actually afford to take their time (and they want to). TPC just keeps them on a tight schedule. At any rate, there has always been a main series release on an anniversary, and thus I see no reason why that would change:2006 (10th Anniversary):2016 (20th Anniversary):2021 (25th Anniversary):2026 (30th Anniversary): Gen 10If there would ever be a financial risk, it would benotreleasing a main series title on the 30th anniversary of the franchise."
2024-02-10T23:39:03+0000,I was mostly pushing a new gen back a year specifically to celebrate an anniversary and thus decrease the money that could be made in 2025. I think that the 2026 release might just be the DLC for Gen 10.
2024-02-11T01:20:06+0000,"They're not pushing anything back. It would obviously be planned that way, as it usually is.There was no main series release in 2005 nor in 2015. The year prior to the anniversary is usually bare."
2024-02-11T07:19:10+0000,"Things can change now, especially considering that they usually stick to the three year gaps for new gens, even if they already released a main series game that year, as seen with SV. So I'm expecting Gen 10 in 2025 and the DLC in 2026."
2024-02-11T09:37:28+0000,"Does anyone else find it exciting how we really have no clue as to what is going to happen? I can't think of another year that was so mysterious. They could go in so many different directions, and there is no telling what direction they are choosing. I am very curious."
2024-02-11T13:12:46+0000,"You know, it's not just the Pokemon franchise that's being very quiet about the future. Nintendo in general is keeping their lips shut in the mist of all these rumors about a new Direct and a successor to the Switch."
2024-02-11T14:20:47+0000,Mystery Dungeon would be my number 1 pick. Specially if a new one adds the gen 6 - gen 9 starters.(I know gen 6 was on Super but that isn't enough. I want my Chespin/Scorbunnycoupleduo
2024-02-11T17:14:19+0000,"In all honesty it would make more sense and be more marketable to have Gen 10 release in 2026 for the 30th anniversary rather then having Gen 10 come out in 2025 and have DLC come out in 2026.Plus they can always release a different type of main series game in 2025 like Legends, Let’s Go,remake, or a new type entirely. Heck if we get a new main series game this year they could release DLC for it  in 2025."
2024-02-11T17:22:07+0000,That hasn't always been the case. Generations 3 and 4 each lasted four years.
2024-02-11T18:09:07+0000,"Except they don't have to release a new gen in a major anniversary year. They already broke that pattern in 2021, when they decided to release Sinnoh remakes instead of jumping straight to Gen 9 for the 25th anniversary.First off, it was not planned for Gen 3 to be four years. Diamond and Pearl was delayed a year and was supposed to come out in 2005, and besides things were different back then. Back then Japan got the game a full year before the rest of the world did, as they took a year off to localize the new gen instead. They took 2003, 2007, and 2011 off to instead localize RS, DP, and BW respectively. Also, they've stuck hard to the three year gen, even to the point where we had two mainline games come out in the same year, with both Legends Arceus and SV coming out in 2022."
2024-02-11T18:50:07+0000,"Look, you can agree to disagree. But the way I see it, I'm thinking we're gonna get new versions of the Johto games on the Switch this year, then we'll get remakes of Black and White 1 for the rumored successor in 2025, then Gen. 10 in 2026 for the 30th anniversary."
2024-02-11T18:51:29+0000,"Except that argument doesn’t work considering the fact that Pokemon Sword and Shield had come out in 2019 so if they had released Scralet & Violet for the 25th anniversary in 2021 that would have meant that Gen 8 would have only lasted two years.Also sure they don’t have to release a new generation on the anniversary, however it something they would likely want to do, especially when you consider the fact releasing Gen 10 in 2025 would mean it’s only a year away from the 30th anniversary and few months away from the start.Also the anniversary that fall on interval of 10 are always a bigger deal then the ones that fall on intervals of 5.No matter how you try to argue it releasing and tieing Gen 10 to the 30th anniversary is going to be more marketable then really releasing any other game or DLC that year."
2024-02-11T19:06:23+0000,"Plus there's VGC and I don't know if people would want to be stuck using Scarlet and Violet for VGC for four years straight. Oh yeah, and all of the other pieces of the franchise like the anime and TCG depend on the usual three year cycle so that they can more quickly get new Pokémon to market and make merch out of."
2024-02-11T20:03:57+0000,This argument doesn’t work because they can easily release a new game that’s not Gen 10 in 2025 or if a main series game comes out this year then they can do DLC in 2025 to hold us over until Gen 10 in 2026.Also if they had no problem sticking the vgc  in Sword&Shield for 3 years having Scarlet & Violet be the VGC for 4 years isn’t going to make much of a difference.
2024-02-11T20:14:34+0000,"Not only would there be an extra year involved here, but also a completely new console. And besides, neither BDSP or Legends Arceus were fit for competitive play anyways. Legends Arceus didn't even have online battling or trading of any kind."
2024-02-11T20:18:06+0000,That really doesn’t as the first Pokémon main series for a new console doesn’t tend to come out until a year more after the new. Console has been released.Also BDSP and Legends Arceus being thing proves that they have no problem keeping the VGC in the same games for a while so an extra year isn’t going to make that much of a difference.
2024-02-11T20:22:22+0000,"It would just be stale and lead to lower interest compared to if they just put out Gen 10 in 2025 and have 2026 be the first VGC cycle for it. The only way it wouldn't be stale is if they released more SV DLC, which I highly doubt."
2024-02-11T20:30:56+0000,Not really again they had no problems keeping the Gen 8 VGC stuck in Sword&Shield for 3 years have Scarlet & Violet VGC around for 4 years isn’t going to make that much of a difference.
2024-02-11T21:41:02+0000,"Plus, if you recall, the pandemic affected Gen. 8's VGC."
2024-02-11T22:15:23+0000,"Yeah. Gen 8's VGC was heavily affected by COVID. There was no World Championships at all in either 2020 or 2021 due to the pandemic, so Sword and Shield really only had one year of VGC. Scarlet and Violet won't have that excuse."
2024-02-11T23:59:22+0000,I’d really like to see remakes for Black and White or a Legends game for Unova or Johto.
2024-02-12T01:46:08+0000,All I want for Pokemon Day 2024Switch ports of the Gen 1-7 gamesBlack 3 and White 3 (Set 15-20 years after Black 2 and White 2)A new Legends gameOne more DLC for Scarlet and Violet
2024-02-12T03:21:11+0000,"In the next 3-5years:BW trilogyGen 10Then after Gen 10, hopefully Pokémon take a break with new gens and just expand on the 10 regions we have by creating prequels or sequels. They can still introduce new Pokémon in each game just say we discovered new species whether completely new, regional variants, branch evo, or convergent species.Add new areas, new stories, new characters, new Pokémon, and even gimmicks to old regions. That would be a great way to expand the lore without creating a new Gen."
2024-02-13T16:48:12+0000,"Wild Unova speculation incoming""ThePokémon Company International have announced a special collaboration that will run in New York on Pokémon Day, February 27th. To celebrate both Pokémon Day and the release of Pokémon Horizons on March 7th, the landmark will be lit up in blue and yellow between sunset and 2am ESTAlongside this, there will be exclusive Timed Research in Pokémon GO for players nearby which gives Pikachu in a Party Hat, as well as event themed PokéStops and Lure Modules that will have a chance of attracting Unown"""
2024-02-13T17:11:47+0000,I'm still not thinking we're revisiting any past region at all.
2024-02-13T19:08:23+0000,you know i wouldn't be mad if they just do another bloated mythical/legendary event like Mewtwo and ZeroaraI just realized I can complete Home's pokedex if I had a Diancie.
2024-02-13T19:33:03+0000,"You're asking for a lot for one year. lolHonestly, we are more likely to get BW3 and a Legends game than we are to get Switch ports of past games, especially before the 30th anniversary. I don't think we should even waste our time hoping for it."
2024-02-13T19:43:43+0000,I think if Switch ports happen it will just be gens 1-3 since they aren't dual screen games.
2024-02-13T22:16:19+0000,"I think so as well. Honestly, all I really want is Ruby & Sapphire, which I'm sure can be easily implemented with online compatibility."
2024-02-14T02:48:27+0000,"That seems like the best scenario. I mean for the DS games, it seems like they're just releasing new versions of them, as evidenced with Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl."
2024-02-14T04:24:50+0000,"Okay, I think the event in New York pretty much tells us where this year is headed.I can't imagine TPC choosing New York in particular to host these events and not have anything Unova-related."
2024-02-14T05:02:58+0000,"Not to be that guy, but how will the Nintendo switch play those dual screen games?"
2024-02-14T06:18:56+0000,They say the next VGC is going to be held at San Francisco. *gaspunovagasp*Not sure if there's any truth to that.
2024-02-14T11:16:23+0000,"Honestly, i'd be fine with them skipping a new game this year if it meant they had more time to work on the next title. But i know that is kinda unrealistic and unlikely given today's standards for the series.That is why i do think that an Unova remake is the most likely scenario. Not because i think everything the company posts on social media is a hint somehow, but rather because i think that is the best strategy for the moment.For one, it's too soon for a new generation. It shouldn't be long until the next Nintendo console and they already tried a fair amount of experimental titles on the current hardware. It is only logical they take advantage of what they learned from these titles and apply it to something that can be seen as the amalgamation of all the successful features they implemented lately rather than another attempt of getting their bearings into something new. Hence why i don't see a repeat of Let's Go and Legends happening for now, though i can see a few features from PLA carrying over due to the critical acclaim (some that may have been too late to add to SV since they were being developed at the same time).A remake is a good opportunity to include more features than usual because they don't have to worry as much about writing and designing."
2024-02-14T20:09:31+0000,"It won't, and we have no need to port them.Even better for TPC, because it gives them an excuse to push more remakes. In fact, due to the success of both Let's GO and Legends(technically BDSP too in terms of initial sales but let's be real, it flopped), I have a feeling we're gonna be seeing A LOT more remakes in the future."
2024-02-14T23:08:25+0000,"My thought on this is that they'll do new versions of Johto, as well as remakes of Black and White 1 and 2 without a doubt within the next few years. As for whether or not they'll remake X and Y onwards, I think it all depends on one thing: if there is a new feature that requires them to be remade. FireRed, LeafGreen, HeartGold and SoulSilver were all made with the intent of implementing the revamped battle system from Ruby and Sapphire into Kanto and Johto. And I feel that the remakes we've had since OmegaRuby and AlphaSapphire have been made with the purpose of implementing the Fairy-type introduced in X and Y."
2024-02-14T23:28:30+0000,"Well, let's be honest. Onlyremake was made with a precise mechanical solution in mind:.FRLG, along withand, was made to correct the issue of Ruby & Sapphire having neither backwards compatibility nor a day/night cycle. These games allowed players to effectively obtain all the pokemon that weren't obtainable in Ruby & Sapphire. Obviously, they could've just added all of these 'mons to, but why do that when you can sell three games? lolEvery subsequent remake was made for no other reason than to capitalize on the success of FRLG, after realizing Pokémon fans are big on nostalgia. Unfortunately, they severely dropped the ball on BDSP. Hopefully they don't make that same mistake with Gen 5."
2024-02-15T15:19:51+0000,"a while back Khu made a post talking about the locations focused for the next games in 2024. They were Johto/Kanto, Unova and Paldea.on top of that he's made posts too asking what everyone thinks we'll be getting in terms of games. Options being, remake, spin off, paradox or legends  respectively.few days ago somebody made a concept of a hybrid game, see photo below. Khu recently has liked it and reposted it on his account, as well has posting photoshopped versions of Reshiram and Zekrom with Ho-Oh and Lugia design elements onto them.do you think some sort of paradoxical take on these games are on the wind? a legends game taking us to and from the Unova's future and Johto's past? a whole new amalgam region called Unohto? We get both a legends and a remaster but one is in Johto and one is in Unova? Unova remaster with Johto DLC like gen 9's?what are your takes are this rumoring and speculation?"
2024-02-15T15:51:08+0000,I've heard of this. I don't know if I like the idea tbh. I'd rather have a proper Johto remake than some weird otherworld version where Reshiram and Ho-Oh are one being (though I've got to admit the designs I saw were pretty cool). But if it had good graphics and wasn't easy like LGPLGE I'd play it anyway.
2024-02-15T16:10:49+0000,When those posts came up what most people were speculating were straight up Unova remakes and the Game Boy games coming to NSO.
2024-02-15T16:11:24+0000,"If they somehow cram in Unova and Johto together, then it would be kind of funny that Johto has to, again, share a game with another region."
2024-02-15T16:13:42+0000,"I also don't know why they would combine Unova, Johto, and Kanto together into one game."
2024-02-15T16:38:26+0000,"Because it would make them tons of money and regardless of what people think,  a game that has 3 regions in it would be one heck of a major pull for people to get the game."
2024-02-15T16:40:16+0000,"It's still something they said they would never do again. We only got a two region game back in Johto because they made Gold and Silver with the mindset that they would be the last Pokémon games they would ever make, and they wanted to go all out on it as a result. A three region game would be a massive sink of money and development time that I don't think they would go for."
2024-02-15T16:47:12+0000,"DLC was also something that was considered something they would never do and yet we got DLC in the last two recent generations. Also most people we’re probably not expecting to get something like Legends Arceus until it was actually revealed.Sure it’s debatable whether they would put 3 major regions in a game like that but’s it’s not something that is impossible or that they would never do, especially if the game winds up being in 2D.And before you try to argue that they wouldn’t have a 2D Pokemon game again BDSP exist which was basically just 2D lifted up.If they have done something once before then it’s possible they can do it again."
2024-02-15T17:02:05+0000,"The only way I would see them ever going them route is if they decided to go the full on MMO route, which I highly doubt."
2024-02-15T19:39:27+0000,You already have gen 8 and gen 9 with 3 different areas.If a Pradox game is happening all it would be I'd wager is something similar to how we can jump from Paldea to Kitakami and to BB Academy.
2024-02-15T19:48:11+0000,Although in those cases it's more comparable to the Sevii Islands than a full on region.
2024-02-15T21:33:14+0000,"How big are those DLC maps compared to Paldea, anyway? It took me about 2 weeks to explore every corner of the Paldea region, it was just THAT big.  Kitakami seemed at least a quarter the size of Paldea. Not sure about the Blueberry Academy."
2024-02-15T22:25:20+0000,"Pokemon(They haven’t called them “directs” in years)Not only do they like the alliteration, but it separates them from Nintendo and their Nintendo Directs.…Anyway I think people expecting a Legends game are a little too ambitious, as I feel Legends Arceus was a flash in the pan due to circumstances in attempting to remake Diamond and Pearl in the Gen 8 style, only to be redirected into what we got with the assets they had…… And obviously change things to better suit that game as well as get it out on time for Scarlet and Violet’s announcement - but after BDSP so to not cannibalize that games’ sales, as BDSP was obviously a last minute decision to capitalize on those that wanted ‘true Diamond and Pearl remakes’(They said PLA and ScVi started around the same time, they never said PLA was intended to be what it was going to end up from the start)…In the end of the day, any leaks that say they’re announcing games during a Nintendo Direct is false because we should all know by now that Pokemon doesn’tmain games during Nintendo Directs.As for what I hope for? Eh, I’ll be minimal and say we might get another remake either Johto again or Black/White, Probably something BDSP styled because Let’s Go was seemingly made due to Go’s popularity, and the mobile game has waned over the years, while I already said a Legends game would be off the table due to how I feel it wasn’t planned.At most, they might try to opt for another round of DLC for Scarlet and Violet, anything to probably get the remaining transfer only Pokemon onto the Switch.Because given Dexit, a Johto remake wouldn’t allow Unovan and Kalosan Pokemon like the Elemental Monkeys and Furfrou, and a Unova remake would just have the Unovan Pokemon.Well duh DLC was something they never do at the time because the games were on the 3DS and they talked constantly about how they weren’t going to do DLC on the 3DS due to hardware limitations and things like that.Which was why we all expected a 3rd version or updated games - remember “Pokemon Gun”? Honestly their methods of doing updates on the 3DS were terrible considering Pokemon and moves added to one game couldn’t be obtained in others, like ORAS Megas and USUM Ultra Beasts and Dusk Lycanroc.As for Legends Arceus, people certainly didn’t expect it, but they sure as Giratina wanted it, because so many were burned by Sword and Shield not being the “evolution of the Pokemon franchise” like Breath of the Wild and Mario Odyssey were.Can’t tell you how many “This is what they should do for Pokemon Switch” news posts and videos that popped up between the Switch’s announcement and the community’s reaction to Let’s Go’sreveal. (And after, with some people not even considering Let’s Go being mainline games despite GameFreak saying it was and them using footage of it during their rants.)“This was what Pokemon Switch SHOULD’VE been!”"
2024-02-16T06:50:23+0000,"Honestly, I’m hoping for a few announcements:1. I want a new Johto game. It has the post game with Kanto, and has some of the best pokemon. I would want more inclusion from newer generations (stupid BDSP), and maybe some regional forms. I’m also good if this were a Let’s Go! kind of game.2. I want another Legends game! Celebi, Kyrum, or even Zygard! (Imagine going to the war, and getting a special Floette like AZ had!)3. I want another DLC to drop for SV, solely to keep me on those games and prolong it as much as possible before Gen 10 drops. I don’t want a rushed game, I want something done REALLY well! So add another DLC where they shoehorn the rest of the Pokemon into the games.4. Last but not least, I want like the Virtual Console did with the 3DS, and have the Switch drop all the old GB, GBA and Gamecube Pokémon games! It would be pretty awesome to play some of those older games again and move Pokemon up directly from them."
2024-02-16T07:24:27+0000,"my dream announcements for this presents would have :unova remake (in any form, be it a faithful ILCA remake, a legends game, a hgss/oras style remake where they let us use newer mons too, or even black and white 3)hoenn pokemon being announced as coming to smile, or shiny pokemon in smile (because i like the art of smile)a new rumble game (with shinies) [there hasnt been a new rumble game since 2019... i miss rumble.]maybe something to do with johto too? i know its been hinted at"
2024-02-16T15:11:09+0000,"If they announce a Johto game I want Johto Pokemon to actually be obtainable IN Johto, and not Kanto, or really late in the game like in Mt. Silver."
2024-02-16T15:49:32+0000,"Thankfully HGSS added the new Safari Zone to allow you to get plenty of Johto mons before the post-game. I also want the Gym Leaders to use more Johto Pokémon on their teams. Across all eight Gym Leaders a total of four Johto Pokémon were used, those being Whitney's Miltank, Jasmine's Steelix, Pryce's Pilowswine, and Clair's Kingdra. The other four Gym Leaders, Falkner, Bugsy, Morty, and Chuck use Kanto Pokémon only."
2024-02-16T22:59:49+0000,"My biggest hope for a Johto game is a modern day sequel that focuses and expands on Johto. It's a region that, for me, has always felt in Kanto's shadow. It deserves to stand more on its own two legs. Like BW2, we should see more regions and areas, make the region bigger. Introduce modern concepts like regional variants and the third/fourth legendary. Over 20 years has passed since Gen II was launched and seeing that in-universe could be really cool"
2024-02-16T23:19:29+0000,"I would love to see Black and White remakes, but I would personally have the National Dex updated to include ALL Pokémon released so far, and give certain Pokémon new Regional Formes that can be obtained through a brand new Evolution Stone."
2024-02-16T23:45:20+0000,I'm hoping we get BW remakes this year while Johto remakes could be for the next system since they were already remade once before.
2024-02-17T00:14:41+0000,"At the very least, we should get the BW2 Pokedex + any new evolutions/forms since then. That's all I ask for."
2024-02-17T04:28:26+0000,"Considering GameFreak’s stance on keeping the pokedex small, Black and White remakes would likely include only the Unova Dex, the non-Unova Dex Pokemon obtainable post game, and maybe a select group of others.Any regional forms would either be nonexistent because they didn’t have them in the original games (BDSP didn’t allow for regional forms for the Pokemon that had them but were obtainable in BDSP) or be only for select Pokemon available after Gen 5 (probably for those that can’t be obtained in a Switch title yet, outside the Unova Dex - and none of them starters)We’re never going to have them pull out all the stops for Black and White remakes…… And the only way they would possibly handle “All 649 Pokemon available up through Black and White at the time” (excluding the regional forms) like they did for BDSP is if they make Black and White remakesBDSP."
2024-02-17T14:19:11+0000,"That would just mean Furfrou, as it and the Watchog line along with the Simi trio are the only Pokemon remaining to not be available in a switch game beyond some mythicals."
2024-02-17T16:42:48+0000,I think that eventually every single Pokémon will be available in a game on the Switch. This might end up meaning that Unova gets skipped in the remake order and they jump straight to Kalos instead.
2024-02-17T17:29:38+0000,"Now that you said that, I'm picturing BW3 or Legends Kyurem/Victini +  Kalos remakes."
2024-02-17T19:36:20+0000,Just had to fix that for you. lol Everything else is fine.
2024-02-17T21:26:32+0000,What I want the most is remakes of Black and White that incorporates things from B2W2.
2024-02-17T22:46:29+0000,"Hey, I'd be fine with both sets getting remade within the next few years."
2024-02-17T22:48:08+0000,"Just give me the BW2 Pokedex, the PWT, Black Tower/White Treehollow, hidden grottos, and challenge mode and I'll be happy. I'm sure we won't get any of those, though.Or, I would even be OK with this: Just remake both sets of 5th gen games. One set this year, another set next year. B/W2 are sequels and have enough ""new"" content that they would feel fresh if released as a 2nd set of remakes the following year."
2024-02-18T00:41:32+0000,"So would I but after things like Dexit and BD/SP having only Gen 1-4 Pokemon, I find it hard to believe that a Unova remake game would have Pokemon beyond Gens 1-5. :[My ideal game announcement would be a Johto remake or just a new Unova game that is similar to Legends Arceus."
2024-02-18T01:10:18+0000,"Not to nitpick but the Johto Safari Zone was still a letdown. There were only about a dozen or so Johto Pokemon available in it before the post-game, almost all of whom could be found in other areas of the region pre-E4 anyways, with a few exceptions such as Misdreavus and Murkrow.If we do get a Let's Go-esque game set in Johto then I do think that we'll get better Johto Pokemon distribution and better Gym Leader rosters. It's just funny to me that we've had to wait almost 25 years for GF to fix a problem that could've been avoided during Gold & Silver's initial development."
2024-02-18T04:42:02+0000,Notice something: battle gimmicks are getting prefixes around the power of ten. Mega (million) evolution. Giga(billion)ntamax. Tera(trillion)stilize. So does this mean we're gonna get a Peta(quadrillion)-something in Gen 10 or 11?
2024-02-18T18:05:34+0000,"I reckon any BW remake is going to mix it up massively. BW3 feels like the way they might go, but PLA changed things up so much that I reckon we must be looking down the barrel of something more new and less remake. Like, returning to that world in a new way, probably open world like S/V with a new take on all the old locations."
2024-02-18T18:12:40+0000,I don't think Pokemon will want to share a short hand name for a gimmick with PETA.
2024-02-18T18:58:21+0000,"I think that they would still do a traditional remake if they decide to do a more experimental style so that new players wouldn't have to hunt down an old system on a site like eBay or Amazon in order to enjoy the game as it originally was, which was one of the reasons why I believe BDSP was even made."
2024-02-18T19:59:42+0000,"I highly doubt it.There is a, why they’ve had every Switch game have a limited pool of Pokémon.We’ve never been given a true reason, just that they’re doing it and they’re likely going to continue to do it.Assuming they even consider it a problem in the first place, that is.They probably thought the Pokemon distribution and the Gym Leader rosters made perfect sense.I’ll throw my tinfoil hat theory back in and say I think BDSP were made the way they were because they originally intended for Legends Arceus to be the Diamond and Pearl remakes before it became its own thing - originally in the style of Sword and Shield until they had to run it back in scope and make it much more simplistic, while BDSP were made just in case people didn’t like Legends.Cover their ground sort of thing.But I believe a smaller scope remake would probably work more since GameFreak got complaints about Scarlet and Violet, so they might not be able to split their employees between the next gen games and a smaller project like Let’s Go/Legends.Might as well make another BDSP style game if it can be done by another company…"
2024-02-18T20:48:22+0000,"That's not what I meant. I actually meant that every single Pokémon will eventually be available to catch in a game released on the Switch. Currently the elemental monkeys, the Patrat line, and Furfrou are unavailable in a Switch game. In fact, Furfrou has not been available to catch since USUM and the Patrat line and the elemental monkeys have not been available since XY."
2024-02-18T21:24:50+0000,"It's possible though not certain. Remember the Z-moves as far i can can see  their name seems (at least according to online sources)  to be a translation that literally mean ""full-powered moves"" or ""Zenith"" rather than a prefix around a power of number 10."
2024-02-18T23:06:55+0000,"Well, if Generation 5 is going to be remade, I wonder what additional features the games will have? I hope Join Avenue gets some upgrades. Although, I don’t think We’ll have the luxury of the Dream World…"
2024-02-18T23:16:03+0000,"i legit think a faithful unova remake would work, considering unova is pretty standalone as a region and game, with it having been a soft-reboot on its own, with very few returning pokemon until the sequel. bdsp was bad because it was diamond and pearl, and as platinum is the superior version of sinnoh with a way better dex, it was not as fun to play. but unova COULD work as a faithful remake, though the graphics would be ugly if it was done by ILCA, unless they did it like an XY style of models, as thats what unova characters in a faithful style would look of."
2024-02-18T23:18:57+0000,What concerns me about a faithful remake (apart from ILCA being involved) is that they might cut all of BW2 content.
2024-02-18T23:27:23+0000,"Rumors about the Switch 2 coming in early 2025 is interesting for the release schedule. With that I mean Gen 10.Lets say Switch 2 really comes out by that time, what happens with the next gen? A third gen on the Switch? Because releasing a new gen for the next console already in 2025 would be absolutely horrible. I dont know when GF got their hands on the dev kits but I cant see how that could work without the games ending up even more a technical abysmall than SV, especially after all that backlash that also hit Nintendo.On the other side, a third gen for the Switch in 2025 means the first full new gen made for the new system would be by the end of 2028, so close to four years after the release of the new console and I dont think GF would take that long for them to move to the next console.So at the end, I think they could be forced to wait until 2026 and release a new gen for the new console at the 30th anniversary and that would just line up perfectly.That means I can see them doing two more sets of games. One in 2024, one in 2025.Honestly I am not a fan of Legends Arceus and the whole ""we remake gen 5 in chibi style and then Legends Kyurem two months later because we cant have them to apart for longer than a couple of months because marketing issues"" feels to tiresome and then we get two mediocre games and a lot of wasted ressources. In that case let ILCA remake BW1 and BW2 at once in BDSP style and have an expansion for both games that tells the story of a BW3, all packed into one cartridge in one release date. Put their ressources into that for 2024. Or a Gold&Silver remake, which would actually make more sense if we look at the remake release schedule including the Lets go Games and that Johto got no games the longest.Then for 2025, its easy. SV as an enhanced version for the Switch successor with DLCs included and extra content and the improvements of a third version, maybe with an altered story line and a new name for the games. Not a lot of ressources needed and I want SV to get a third version treatment before we leave this gen.Then gen 10 in 2026. Assuming ILCA makes the Unova remake like the Sinnoh ones and Game Freaks side team that also worked on the SWSH DLCs making a potential SV enhanced version, that gives the GF the full four years of gen 9 to make and polish the gen 10 games.IMO thats the best route Pokemon can take in the next 2-3 years."
2024-02-18T23:40:31+0000,"That’s assuming Join Avenue doesn’t get cut if they only decide to remake locations pertaining to BW1. As for the dreamworld, even if they resurrected the pokemon global link site or some sort of substitute, I worry that in a couple of years it would be unusable again when they decide to pull the plug on online services."
2024-02-19T00:40:09+0000,"I liked the concept behind Legends Arceus, but I REALLY wish they had thrown in a Distortion World plot and that we had seen at least part of Dialga and Palkia's dimensions. The TCG teased up with artwork of their home worlds but we've never truly visited either of them.Also, the real-time combat really made the game unwinnable for me as I have slower than normal reflexes."
2024-02-19T14:19:46+0000,I get the feeling that GF are gonna do something no one is predicting that seems to be their MO since well Gen 5. There is nothing stopping them having a Unova or Johto games without it being a remake similar to say if PLA released but no BDSP beforehandBesides remakes are pointless Gen 4 onwards so I think we may get 2 ARPG game of past region but no base remake
2024-02-19T14:29:13+0000,"As I have said, they have yet to implement the Fairy-type into the Johto adventure, plus Black and White 1 and 2. So I think we're gonna get those down the line. What everyone is having a hard time figuring out is what order they will come."
2024-02-19T16:35:39+0000,will be funny if this year will just be Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky DX and Let's Go Pichu & Togepi.with SV just getting another mythical event alongside mobile game updates.
2024-02-19T17:17:23+0000,"So, there's this pyoro leaker guy who seems to be right about nintendo directs and stuff, and they said there'll be a ""partner direct"" this weekand then tweeted thishttps://twitter.com/i/web/status/1759404045213798807I don't think any big reveal will come from this but maybe some tease for what's coming on Pokémon Day? Do we even have a pokémon presents confirmation yet?"
2024-02-19T17:40:11+0000,its always on the 27th so we won't see it until next week.
2024-02-19T22:24:03+0000,Could see this as a possible outcome. Not too keen on another Let’s Go game (more so due to the catching mechanic) though an Explorers of Sky remake would be pretty sweet.
2024-02-19T23:21:28+0000,"Well now that Nintendo has finally announced the February Direct for the year, seeing how it's a partner showcase, I believe that in addition to the next mainline series game, they'll announce a new spin-off title to fill in the release schedule for April or May. As for what specifically, I wouldn't mind a remastered version of Mystery Dungeon Explorers, as long as it includes the additional content from Explorers of Sky, as well as exclusive new features that make it worth revisiting."
2024-02-19T23:22:08+0000,"Game Freak is working on an action-adventure game with Take-Two Interactive. It was reported last year. For a Partner Showcase, it seems more likely that Game Freak would reveal something about this game rather than a Pokemon game since we have Pokemon Directs for that sort of thing."
2024-02-19T23:32:40+0000,Yeah. There's probably gonna be one on the 27th anyways.
2024-02-19T23:39:56+0000,"I mean, we've had one every year for three consecutive years so far, so the odds are pretty good."
2024-02-20T02:27:05+0000,"Idk what (if any) features they'd bring in from BW2, but an upgraded Join Avenue seems like the sort of thing they could market like they did with the Grand Underground"
2024-02-20T06:14:20+0000,"Would a Direct normally have been announced by now in previous years? (Given we’re only a week away from Pokemon Day) or, are they announced nearer to the day itself than this?"
2024-02-20T06:20:38+0000,"Typically, the announcement of a Pokémon Presents is made 2 to 4 days prior to the broadcast."
2024-02-20T09:58:27+0000,"My prediction is a BW3 game. It feels like it’s time to return to Unova. Throw in some Chibi remakes of BW or BW2 (or maybe a merged version?) and you have the pattern fro PLA and BDSP repeated.Which will mean that GF will probably and likely do something completely different, thus breaking the patterns again, as they always tend to do."
2024-02-20T11:13:20+0000,"Still thinking the biggest we will get main series wise is a remake or a Legends style game, perhaps with a spin-off title sprinkled in. If we get a Unova remake we could see younger versions of the BB Elite Four as cameos, Lacey and Drayton are pretty obvious but Amarys and Crispin are trickier."
2024-02-20T11:19:35+0000,"Yeah, I just thought they might announce the Pokémon Presents date/time at the partner showcase, nothing more. But they just announced the pokémon presents today anyway lolLet's see what we get, I'm still assuming nothing major for this year"
2024-02-20T12:03:42+0000,"All right, announcements for both the Direct and this back-to-back. Intriguing that they announced the Pokemon Presents exactly one week before it happens. But hey, gives us fans more time to prepare and be excited for it."
2024-02-20T12:22:15+0000,"Honestly not sure what they plan to reveal, if anything significant, considering the Switch successor is presumably going to be revealed this year. It'd be odd to reveal another Switch title, especially considering how many are on the system already. Not like I'd complain or anything, I'm hopelessly addicted to Pokemon and would take any game they offered to us.I'm personally hoping we see another Legends game for early Unova, there's enough lore within that gen to justify it. I think Arceus sold well enough as a mainline-side-game to warrant another. I also wouldn't mind a Lets Go Johto version, the original games were pretty fun outside of the jank throwing mechanic not working sometimes, so seeing a beautiful Johto in that artstyle could be really interesting.Realistically, if they're announcing a new game, it's probably going to be a new mobile game or something."
2024-02-20T12:44:51+0000,"Didn't CentroLeaks say the Switch 2 (or whatever it is called) was delayed for a year? It sounds like Gen X will come out in 2026 AKA on the 30th anniversary of Pokemon.Khu has been hinting at some unholy fusion of Johto and Unova with paradox legends that are fusions of Reshiram/Ho-Oh and Zekrom/Lugia BUT I think he is trolling us all. Either that or people misinterpreted the riddle as tends to happen and he was actually saying we're getting both regions as separate but intertwined games. At the risk of sounding like a killjoy, I'm seriously hoping it is the latter. I don't trust GameFreak to actually pull off such a cool concept properly on the first try."
2024-02-20T13:02:32+0000,Unless they go back to the old practice of having Japan get the games a full year before the rest of the world I'm not expecting another four year gen.
2024-02-20T14:19:39+0000,"I don’t believe this will happen at all, but it would certainly be a first to mix legendary pokemon from different regions and it could even open the door for regular pokemon to be fused. Although I doubt a mechanic to let players fuse pokemon will ever exist, it would certainly be easier if gamefreak did the mixing themselves, but this is wild thinking and I don’t think it will come to fruition either way."
2024-02-20T19:29:45+0000,"Or TPC could simply have Gen 10 launch on the 30th anniversary of the franchise. That would make the most sense.I've learned long ago not to buy into anything Riddler Khu says, given all he does is wait until someone else reveals the truth and takes credit for it. The ""riddles"" are merely his way of buying time.More often than not, the real leaks come not long before a Pokémon Presents goes live (i.e. Sun & Moon getting leaked just hours before the 2016 broadcast), so for those who like leaks, I would recommend putting your money there.My honest guess is we're going to be receiving two titles: one set in Johto and another set in Unova. However, one of these titles will be developed by a company other than Game Freak (please not ILCA)."
2024-02-20T20:08:09+0000,"Well.. On YouTube, Pokemon Present's game category is set as Pokemon Gold/Silver.Spoiler"
2024-02-20T20:42:02+0000,"Might want to put that whole thing inside a spoiler tag, just for your information. But yeah, this is what I was expecting."
2024-02-20T20:48:16+0000,Hasn't that happened before and it ended up meaning nothing? Unless I'm experiencing deja vu.
2024-02-20T21:10:01+0000,Hopefully.  I'd rather have BW remakes over anything with Johto especially since they've already had their remakes.
2024-02-20T21:12:42+0000,"I wouldn't know for sure, but if they're not revisiting that particular region then why put the original games from its debut generation as the category for the YouTube video?"
2024-02-20T21:23:45+0000,I hope that that's Unova remake because my profile is Snivy.But how will the anime handle that Unova Remake is a good question to ask.
2024-02-20T21:37:22+0000,"SpoilerMaybe BW remakes and a Johto Legends game?Though if they do nothing with Unova before Gen 10, I wonder why they had a bunch of references to that region in Indigo Disk."
2024-02-20T22:17:29+0000,"We might get two new games, BW remakes and a new Johto game."
2024-02-20T22:31:50+0000,"This doesn't necessarily denote a particular major release, but merely that there is something in the video related to that title."
2024-02-20T22:34:47+0000,Namely the music. A guy in the comments pointed out that the tune originated in Gold and Silver.
2024-02-20T22:37:39+0000,"It won't for a lot of reasons, mostly relating to VGC. I don't think that they would want to have Scarlet and Violet be the VGC game for four years straight, especially with the launch of a new console. I don't think that Nintendo would want to have the competitive scene for one of their biggest IPs still on their previous console when they're trying to market a new console."
2024-02-20T23:22:35+0000,"I imagine they will throw in some Unova pokemon in the anime, perhaps the RVT will visit Unova and some character from the BW games may appear as well (probably one that didn’t appear in Best Wishes, like they did with Kabu in Galar).Exactly, I think it’s Unova’s turn."
2024-02-20T23:35:43+0000,"Utsunomiya didacknowledge that Pokemon's release schedule is affecting the quality of the product; coupled with the Switch's succesor, whatever it may be, getting pushed back a year might work in Pokemon's favor. It's aexcuse to delay Gen 10 another year so it can be on the incoming console.Johto remakes but instead of going to Kanto at the end, we go to Unova?"
2024-02-20T23:36:46+0000,"Given they've already done this twice before, I'd say it's pretty likely.50% of any business' success lies in marketing. Having a major release on a major anniversary is not only brilliant marketing, it's imperative marketing, which is why they've already done it twice.Also (and I'm kinda tired of mentioning this), Nintendo has no power over what TPC does. They merely own part of the company; they do not run it. And for the record, the competitive scene is governed entirely by its own company,Play! Pokémon, which operated entirely in the United States."
2024-02-20T23:44:06+0000,"It was actually once with SM. DP was delayed and was actually meant to come out in 2005. And besides, they don't need to do a new gen for a major anniversary. For the 25th they chose to make Sinnoh remakes rather than jumping straight to Gen 9, and all they did for their 15th was localize BW."
2024-02-21T00:00:27+0000,"The 15th is not a major anniversary, and TPC considersa major release, and marked it as the major release of the 25th Anniversary.I mean, seriously. Think of this from the viewpoint of a business owner. If you were running The Pokémon Company, would you really chooseto launch the next generation on the 30th anniversary of the franchise, even worse, the year BEFORE the 30th anniversary? That is simply not a good business practice, and say what you want about the games, but The Pokémon Company has EXCELLENT business practices.Also, they plan these generations years in advance (ironically enough), not just the games but the tv shows, movies, trading cards and merchandise. They would obviously plan ahead for the 30th anniversary."
2024-02-21T01:39:46+0000,supposedly the presents is going to feature gold and silver music so it might very well be a johto remake of sorts
2024-02-21T01:42:01+0000,Maybe it relates to Celebi And/or Johto in the not-too-distant future.
2024-02-21T02:34:20+0000,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1760080064962548044A new pokeball Pokémon!? Mama mia pizzeria!
2024-02-21T02:50:34+0000,Looks a bit like Hisuian Voltorb from what little I see.
2024-02-21T03:14:00+0000,DAMN IT! WHY ARE THEY HIDING IT IF WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT IT D:<
2024-02-21T04:03:53+0000,"To drive you crazy, as their goal is clearly to figure out how to personally drive Rune Knight crazy.lol XD"
2024-02-21T05:23:40+0000,What!? Who said I'm crazy!?! You think I'm crazy!?!? I'm not crazy!! !!!!11 They're crazy!! I'm not crazy!!!1111
2024-02-21T12:06:49+0000,I was gonna suggest what if we got another SV DLC but remembered epilogue more or less confirms that's the end for SVIt's been so long since LGPE released I don't think GF will do another game in that style I think it was always intended to be a one off as they bridged the gap between 3DS & SwitchI'm sticking to my prediction of a set of ARPG games set an older region
2024-02-21T12:13:19+0000,"More like a gimmick of a game to help transition casual Pokémon Go players into the mainline games, which means that same premise can't necessarily work near as well the second time."
2024-02-21T12:28:24+0000,Yeah. LGPE was a one off specifically designed to appeal to new players that were brought to the series through Go to help ease them into the main series. It also helps that it was released close to Go's hype period.
2024-02-21T12:55:57+0000,"There's a lot of talk about two new games (one in johto and another in unova) but if we are getting these, my guess is that the johto one will be lesser scale like LGPE for switch this year (keeping the annual releases, sigh) and the other will be on the switch's sucessor.I mean, so far all the remakes we got were for new consoles, right? Never got two remakes in the same console. (even though they can change that at any moment, of course)Also, I think the ILCA slander we see a lot in the community is very misdirected. See, they are not necessarily bad developers, they probably got the outline from the game The Pokémon Company wanted they to make (in a very short time) and they made THAT the way they could. That doesn't mean any future games made by them would be bad."
2024-02-21T13:43:25+0000,"If SV gets anything, it’ll probably be a new mystery gift or special raid event"
2024-02-21T13:44:54+0000,"If you count LGPE as a remake than we already got two remakes on the same console, with both LGPE and BDSP coming out for the Switch."
2024-02-21T15:03:39+0000,"LGPE was definitely a remake. Not the same remake as that before, but a remake nonetheless."
2024-02-21T15:11:52+0000,"So, what's the chance of Pokémon day revealing the Unova remakes?Also, they better cook it up with a Unova remake."
2024-02-21T15:59:23+0000,"Well, technically, the Epilogue confirms the end to. It doesn't necessarily confirm the end of DLC for Scarlet & Violet."
2024-02-21T16:29:11+0000,"I would be very surprised - pleasantly surprised mind - if Pokemon day gave us more SV news. I think we’ve had the ending, and the game wrapped up in a neat purple and pink bow.Even today, playing the game to try and get the last of the in game trades at the academy, I am reminded that it’s been over two years since SV came out, and I have some fatigue over the online Tera raids - they never really sorted the issues. I’m a little tired of ogre ousting - it’s too hard in single player.And yet -- I know this is probably the most fun I’ve had with a Pokemon title in decades. Paldea was amazing. Area Zero, possibly the greatest end of game area in Pokémon’s history. It’s more iconic than the Unknown Dungeon - there, I said it - and the open world, despite graphical issues, despite some bugs, is one of the most ambitious and at times beautiful game landscapes out there.If this is the end of SV - and I think it is - then it’s had a great run and the next games will surely build on these solid blocks."
2024-02-21T23:17:20+0000,"we could get another mythical event, but otherwise i don't think we'll see anything close to the DLC we already have gotten."
2024-02-22T01:16:51+0000,"I'm curious, assuming we get Unova remakes, if all the new locations in B2W2 will be present from the get go in BW. I mean Aspertia, Floccesy, Virbank, Lentimas and Humilau just don't get built in a span of two years."
2024-02-22T01:48:44+0000,Maybe the routes are there but are blocked off with some type of notice about them being under construction like the Battle Frontier in oras?
2024-02-22T01:51:54+0000,Or alternative is they make B2W2 areas DLC for the remakes.
2024-02-22T03:41:19+0000,My final predictions for Pokemon Day 2024News about mobile gamesA new Pokemon Legends gameBlack 3/White 3Switch ports for Gen 1-7 gamesA remaster of Pokemon Ranger 1&2A fully open world Pokemon game (Super Pokemon Odyssey or something like that)
2024-02-22T06:59:34+0000,"Now for mine!Gamefreak announces that it will be declaring war against Palworld. Anybody caught playing Palworld will be labeled an enemy of Gamefreak, and have their Switch console banned from NSO. Furthermore, a team of shinobi will be sent after them.Oh and Pokémon Sleep 2."
2024-02-22T07:12:47+0000,"I’m hoping for a Pokemon movie, another Pokemon Legends game, and hopefully the Pokémon‘s first anime season doesn’t get the DBZ Kai treatment. Maybe a trailer for a secondary anime based on the Legends Arceus, but in 2-d hand-drawn animation?"
2024-02-22T07:22:40+0000,"We are in desperate need for a Pokemon movie. Whether it features Ash or the Rising Volt Tacklers, it'd be nice to see one. Could also be something totally unexpected like live-action or computer animated. I think that Pokemon Day would be an appropriate time to announce it."
2024-02-22T10:52:16+0000,"I hate BW2 story so much, I hated the stupid the cat rival subplot. Ideally if we get a base Gen 5 remake I'd like BW1 story but BW2 dex and featuresWhat if GF get another studio to do the base remake instead of Ilca, everyone is just assuming it's themThe thing about PLA is it was so unique not sure how they do another Legends without it feeling like we've treading water again so that's why I think we'll get an ARPG but not necessarily a Legends game or it will be completely different to PLA ie ultimate goal may not be about making a dex etc"
2024-02-22T11:06:05+0000,"This would be ideal, but they have been ignoring the content of the third versions in ORAS & BDSP. Let’s hope they don’t do the same with BW2 content."
2024-02-22T12:05:15+0000,"my honest guess for the presentsMobile game updates (Unite, Cafe Remix, GO, Sleep, Smile and MastersEX)TCG and Championships updateHorizons localization update and possibly a new movie announcementNew animated short series releasePokemon SV raid, mass outbreak and possibly new mystery gift event announcements1 or 2 trailers for Pokemon 2024 releases; where everyone will be both excited and disappointed as we let the culminative hype and theories bloat our perspectives."
2024-02-22T12:32:56+0000,"I honestly think the best way to approach Unova would be to do a BW3, thereby using everything in BW/BW2 in terms of areas, but a new storyline. The “original dragon” storyline has a lot of mileage in it, IMO, would be an ideal starting point for changing up Unova.What would be interesting is if we got new Pokemon that become part of the Unova dex. That’s something we haven’t really seen - new Pokemon added to old dexes to up the numbers."
2024-02-22T12:50:33+0000,"if they did do BW3, I do suspect it will look something like BDSP or Let's Go but play functionally the same.It could very much be the BW2 dex with some new additions or regional forms added in."
2024-02-22T13:39:25+0000,Going into this with low expectations especially after last year’s was kind of meh. Masters is probably the most exciting thing here for me but there’s a 99% chance we’ll know what will be shown before the PD Direct (can’t wait for people to get mad thinking it’s a mainline trailer before realizing it’s the evil gacha lol)I think I’d be ok with most things they could release besides Let’s Go Johto. A BW remake made with ILCA’s boss design would be ideal for me. Unpopular opinion but BDSP was more fun to me than the other mainline games on Switch besides Legends Arceus. I’m also intrigued by the possibility of a B3W3. Whatever it is I hope the game actually runs well.
2024-02-22T13:59:19+0000,"The thing with that idea, though, is that it would likely turn off a bunch of potential new players who would be led to believe they need to play both BW & BW2 first to understand what's going on in BW3, and you don't necessarily want to do that with a big game release, especially when those two prequels are only available for DS systems. And whether or not that need is actually accurate, the thought/implication would definitely still be there, and could definitely hurt sales."
2024-02-22T14:07:49+0000,"I miss the time when we had actual leaked images instead of cryptic leakers messages. It was kind of fun trying to guess i they were fake or not, like what happened with alolan starters final evos and with that one (or two?) leaked low quality pics of LGPE before we even knew the games existedNow with pokémon day right around the corner I'd like something like that to happen again, someone claiming to have pics of Unova remakes or let's go johto"
2024-02-22T15:27:47+0000,"I don’t think that follows - it’s entirely possible to unify the two existing plots within one game, IMO, and a third version could tie it all up further. You set it up as the definitive BW experience, incorporating the storylines of the first two sets with a third game. Doable, IMO."
2024-02-22T15:45:50+0000,"However, my point is that the title ""BW3"" would imply a continuation of the previous two stories, not a merging of them as you describe in your response, which I agree is possible. However, I'd probably call it something much different if you're wanting it to be some sort of super bundle of BW & BW2."
2024-02-22T16:23:48+0000,If we were to get BW3 games. Do you think Iris will remain champion?
2024-02-22T17:12:55+0000,We won't.Iris being Champion is ok. Some E4 changes are more than needed (especially since Grimsley is now in Alola). I can see Brycen becoming an E4.
2024-02-22T17:25:35+0000,I don't think that BW3 will happen unless they either remake or rerelease both BW1 and 2. The reason is so that new players don't have to scour eBay for used DSes and DS games (which can go for hundreds of dollars) in order to understand the story.
2024-02-22T17:29:33+0000,B0W0 as a prequel would be interesting.And name would be a nice pun to Absolute 0 temperature.
2024-02-22T18:52:33+0000,"You know…that has the ring of a GF thing to do. Black Zero, White Zero.That really works. You can go back to the original dragon story, introduce the original dragon, and have a new plot and areas to boot.I like that."
2024-02-22T18:59:10+0000,"I don't mean to be a killjoy, but apparently cEnTrO lEaKs (this Pokemon leak account) has made a post that talks about current leaks ongoing about pokemon day 2024. Sounds cool, right?Here's the thing, it's actually paywalled. Guys, we have a bum, that shitty account's paywalling leaks. Why do we have to pay up to even see leaks that at best might be potentially questionable?"
2024-02-22T19:04:01+0000,Lol I’m not giving them one cent and nobody else should either. We will find soon enough what gamefreak is up to anyway.
2024-02-22T19:27:14+0000,"Exactly what I was trying to explain to someone earlier, so I'm glad I'm not the only one with this realization."
2024-02-22T19:37:07+0000,"I'm not seeing a paywall, what are you referring to?"
2024-02-22T19:40:27+0000,"Dual Black and Dual White-ILCA styled remakes of BW1 and BW2 merged together (pretty much a HGSS scenario on how you progress through it). People will complain of the lack of qol updates and other features from the originals missing due to time constraints and limitations.Legends BlackGold/SilverWhite-A legends game where you are traveling back and forth from a past version of Johto and future version of Unova. It will have a unifying story that many will wish were two separate games. Will act as a pseudo BW3. Focuses on the Shadow Triad as the main antagonists trying to get Ghetsis back into a place of power by uncovering the mystery of the Original Dragon of Unova lore. Regional form version exclusives and such will be added, and a limited dex from both gen 2 and gen 5's dexes."
2024-02-22T19:53:44+0000,exactly where i'm pulling it frombut in all honesty BW1 ILCA remakes and maybe something else like a Spin off remake seems more likely to me.
2024-02-23T02:01:01+0000,"Yeah, some old pokemon games are inflated and I understand why some people don’t want to pay over $100 dollars to greedy resellers for games that costed $40 dollars upon release. Apart from that, there are features like the dreamworld that simply don’t function anymore."
2024-02-23T03:15:31+0000,That was the biggest flaw of BW2. The internet support for them were abruptly shut down a year after their release and that really hurt the Medal system and the loss of the Dreamworld cut off how many Pokemon you could get with HA and ruined the gimmick of White Forest and Black City.
2024-02-23T12:30:21+0000,"To be fair I think it's perfectly possible pull off a BW3 at this point, just don't make it TOO tied to the other two main stories. Just give enough context to the characters in-game, and that's it.I mean the protagonist for the third game wasn't there for the first two so they can make it in a way it doesn't make much of a difference if the player hasn't been there either.I'm pretty sure this has been done in the game industry a lot, specially with older games getting sequels"
2024-02-23T13:08:26+0000,"Still, the presence of the sequel numbering alone can overwhelm new players and possibly force them to spend hundreds of dollars on eBay for old consoles and games just so they can understand the story. I think that if a BW3 is happening, then both BW1 and 2 will be remade alongside it."
2024-02-23T17:30:32+0000,"From a business standpoint, it would be smarter for TPC to rerelease the original games as well, instead of leaving players to outside retailers.If we do get BW3, I do find it likely that BW1 and BW2 will be ported. It's just easy money."
2024-02-23T17:56:36+0000,I wish they would have released a final 3ds that came preloaded with all the pre Gen 7 games.  I still have never played the original Gen 3 games since I never owned a Gameboy Advance.
2024-02-23T19:49:55+0000,"That would've been a bad move, as it would've required a meaty discounting of the market price to make it worth the purchase.I do feel you on the Gen 3 absence, though. Those games are pretty damn magical. I do hope you get the opportunity to play them._________________________________________________________________________In other news, I just found out I gotta be up at 6am sharp to watch the live stream, now that I live in California. This sucks. lol"
2024-02-23T20:48:12+0000,"i am also on the west coast and have set alarms every 5 minutes starting at 5:45 on the day of a Presents, just so i am sure to wake up. my boyfriend is so lucky, as he gets to wake up at almost 9 in comparison, due to us currently being long distance and him currently on the east coast."
2024-02-23T22:49:44+0000,I'm gonna have to set an alarm as well. I might just set it for 5:30 to make things easier.
2024-02-23T23:14:57+0000,I’m usually at work at between 7:30 and 7:45 my time (I don’t have a set time to show up) so I’ll be watching it while at work. Just hoping nobody tries to talk to me for those 20-ish minutes.
2024-02-24T18:54:38+0000,"I do believe I work from home that day, so I'm hella lucky. I can just go back to sleep afterwards."
2024-02-25T04:24:16+0000,"Your reaction? ILCA still develops the remakes, but... the overworld art style follows that of the 3DS games, uses full models in battles, and it's actually an enhanced (not faithful) remake.Personally, I would be okay with that."
2024-02-25T04:41:33+0000,"I mean, if they do a better job, of course we'd all be fine with it. The question is, will they?"
2024-02-25T04:47:59+0000,"id enjoy that! a lot! i think gen 5's artstyle is closer to xy's style anyway, so itd probably look similar"
2024-02-25T05:29:42+0000,"Gen 2 and Gen 5 are the only gens that have yet to be made into 3D :OFurthermore, if you flip the number 2 (heheh I said number 2) upside down, you get a 5. Coincidence? Probably, but the more fun answer would be that this was fate."
2024-02-25T05:40:59+0000,Getting both Johto AND Unova would be amazing. But I seriously doubt it.
2024-02-25T05:55:06+0000,unless one is a 2024 release and the other 2025also holy **** the hell that will break loose if neither gen 2 or gen 5 get a legends or remake announcement and it some new little spin off or another let's go.
2024-02-25T06:12:29+0000,"For Gen 6, we got Gen 3. For Gen 7, we got Gen 1. For Gen 8, we got Gen 4. So, given this formula, I'm betting either Gen 2 or 5 during Gen 9's run, and the other one for Gen 10. I think that they want to eventually have every game in 3D, and maybe this could include BW2 since it has its own story."
2024-02-25T07:52:46+0000,"I think most of the fandom would accept a Let’s Go Johto. Honestly not sure they would do another Let’s Go though given they claimed it was a one off to ease GO fans into the mainline games. You never know though.Keen for whatever is announced- agree tbat both Johto and Unova is a stretch. I’d be happy with either or, even though my hearts desire would be both!"
2024-02-25T08:04:30+0000,"For the people who get unreasonably angry about mobile games being in the Presents, it’s been confirmed that we’re getting new units revealed on Pokemon Day for Masters EX (total shocker, I know)."
2024-02-25T10:25:32+0000,"Bold statement, but I don’t think ILCA will be involved this time around. It’s rare that GF and Ninty ever say publicly that they’re angry with third party developers, but it did happen for BDSP, which I think is telling."
2024-02-25T12:47:01+0000,"You know, that would be very cool. The question is, which will come first.That's what I'm thinking too. From the looks of things, they could do Gen. 2 first, then next year remake Black and White 1. And then during Gen. 10, they could remake Black and White 2, followed by a successor to Legends set in Unova. And since Legends took place in the past, I think it would be cool if the successor took place in the future."
2024-02-25T18:01:50+0000,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1761773049848942928It's never been more over than it is now
2024-02-25T18:48:56+0000,for all we know it could be Bandai Namco or any other developer TPCI/GF have worked with before.
2024-02-25T21:56:19+0000,I can’t remember how far in but Soul Silver went into it in great detail.
2024-02-26T00:49:20+0000,"Its interesting that Pyoro said that while he has heard of a Unova-centric game, the info comes from a while back last year so he's not certain. He told Centro he'd willingly take an L if its wrong."
2024-02-26T02:55:44+0000,"If this is still correct we could very well see the same thing that happened with gen 4, happen with gen 5.Outsourced 1:1 remake or traditional qol updated remakeGF Team A made Legends or mold breaking gameWhile GF Team B is working on 2025's release or gen 10.But still, it is out dated info and we have heard GF talk about shake ups in the past year or so, what Tuesday brings is anybody's guess."
2024-02-26T03:16:30+0000,"So, the potential BW remake is outsourced. Probably ILCA again. Like I said, I'd be completely fine with it as long as the graphics are at least that of the 3DS era/Let's Go and it's an enhanced remake. You can be faithful on the original game but still add QoL and new/updated features."
2024-02-26T03:44:40+0000,"I'm really don't think ILCA is a poor game developer, but it all depends on the conditions the pokémon company has them working on. Be it time wise or related to restrictions on alterations in the games.There's not much we can do besides praying for the best, but I'm hopeful it'll be better than what we got with BDSP. Personally, I'd like a SWSH style remake of Black and White, even if it's without the wild area or anything similar to that. (there's no way they'll make a open world style remake so SWSH style would be my bet for a modern-ish looking remake)"
2024-02-26T05:28:56+0000,"I do like BW mainly because of the impact of the story and the sheer amount of new pokémon available. But none of these are truly new anymore, so without improvements to the game's content and the overwhelming linearity of the region i don't really think the remake would be able to stand on its own, regardless of whatever graphic they chose to go with.It'd just be another ""faithful"" remake that instead of adding to the series, just half-heartedly replaces a few features for sometimes worse ones."
2024-02-26T11:53:34+0000,"Now Switch 2 is all but confirmed for Mar 2025, what if GF outsource completely like they aren't making anything this year and them concentrating fully on Gen 10?Or what if GF release their Legends style Unova game for the Switch 2 launch?"
2024-02-26T12:51:50+0000,I can see Switch 2 starting with Johto similar how Switch 1 started with Kanto.I doubt we won't get any game for this year. HybridHero made an interesting video why GF release a new game each year and even started introducing new Pokemon mid-gen:
2024-02-26T13:04:28+0000,"Personally if I'm going to guess what's coming in presents it's going to be Legends Celebi. I think that because:This year is the 25th anniversary of Gold and Silver so a new Johto game would be appropriate. But if Game Freak wants to release it early next year (on the Switch) I'll be fine with that just as long it is not like the mess that is Scarlet and Violet.Johto's lore would make a Legends game set in it work, also Celebi's time-travel abilities could gives us an excuse to send our character back in time.The Paradox Pokemon hint in Scarlet. Dinosaur Suicune, Raikou and Entei = past Johto game. Same could be said for Unova too. Speaking of...I know the writing is on the wall for Black and White getting remakes but if we get them I don't want them to be 1-to-1 remakes. I want them to be HGSS and ORAS levels of quality. Add content from the sequels like locations and a post-game inspired by its story, upgrade gameplay rather than downgrade from what came before (I'm looking at you BDSP TM's and contests), add regional-forms like Let's Go and maybe the new evolutions from Scarlet and Violet, and maybe add more to the story and flesh out the characters a bit more even though the cast good enough already. Basically don't be a glorified port. Gen V is my favourite generation and what I don't want is for the remake to suck. I want it to be good.Going back to Johto I just have this feeling that we're getting something there, I'm 100% certain of it. Also I'm sure there are many of you out there that want to see the region make a comeback. Hopefully it happens, I really want another Legends game.And also can we have Gen 1 re-released for Nintendo Switch Online, pweease."
2024-02-26T13:10:28+0000,BW from ILCA? No...Hard pass for me. BDSP were already bad and with that dumb nostalgia bait from the recent remakes I dont have any hope for them to make a decent remake.
2024-02-26T14:44:54+0000,"I've played HGSS and ORAS many times but I have no desire to go back to BDSP. Maybe eventually I will, but I never played Diamond/Pearl so I didn't really feel that nostalgia. I've played Platinum numerous times and BDSP just didn't have the things from Platinum that I liked."
2024-02-26T16:26:14+0000,"I think a new mythical may get announced, the focus of yellow is also the remaining color needed for the spectrum theme this gen has had.TPCI just posted this""What lies beyond Ogapon and Terrapagos' gaze?"""
2024-02-26T16:30:01+0000,I don't see it. Can you post the link to Twitter? Maybe they deleted it for some reason.
2024-02-26T16:32:39+0000,https://x.com/riddler_khu/status/1762102706746097682?s=46
2024-02-26T16:34:42+0000,its on their japanese twitter since right now is the 27th for them
2024-02-26T16:41:42+0000,"This was my problem for BDSP. It was essentially the exact same game, with minor differences.It was fine with FireRed & LeafGreen, because those games were meant to solve the lack of backwards compatibility. Now, they need to step up the ante. If they do another carbon copy, it just might be the first Pokémon title - main or remake - that I refuse to buy."
2024-02-26T16:48:28+0000,"I thought the Sinnoh remakes were gonna be like Sword/Shield with its own ""wild areas"" and everything."
2024-02-26T16:55:18+0000,"they were on the right track with the new underground environments but ya, thats what I was thinking it would be as well.wasn't 'new' enough worth the purchase for meif its the same with gen v i'll pass unless it actually looks pretty."
2024-02-26T17:19:26+0000,I wish we had been able to see the Distortion World in PLA. I wonder if it was originally intended but got scrapped due to covid delays.
2024-02-26T17:46:11+0000,"But like, really, it won't take much to do a Black & White 3. Just give us a new story, a new protagonist, and a new town. That's it!Literally everything else can be the same."
2024-02-26T17:57:08+0000,"Even if it's a remake of the original BW, and not BW3, I'll probably still get it regardless.  I never even played the originals and only did Black 2."
2024-02-26T18:27:26+0000,"i pretty that is just the logo for area zero, as Terapagos caused that affect to happen during one of its animations and has been present for both the dlc logos"
2024-02-26T20:28:31+0000,"Come tomorrow, here’s hoping for a new Pokemon games with potential, including a new legends game."
2024-02-26T20:46:01+0000,i think no matter what people will be disappointed in someting
2024-02-26T21:13:26+0000,"I'm hoping for a Gen II themed game(s), either Gold/Silver remakes similar to the Let's Go games, or something similar to Legends Arceus. I wouldn't be particularly impressed if we get Gen V remakes, mainly because I wasn't that fond of Black/White to begin with, and partially because I fear that remakes of Gen V games would be too faithful to the originals like BD/SP were to D/P, and ultimately disappointing to me."
2024-02-26T22:02:43+0000,"No argument there. Now, I don’t want to be that guy, but, I wonder if the future games will have the return of any past game features like… the Game Center (but with the Voltorb flip), Safari Zone, the Battle Frontier, the berry fields, perhaps new fossils?"
2024-02-26T22:08:40+0000,"Its been three years since BDSP and I still hate what they did to these games. ILCA developing another remake is expectable but they need to step up and deliver a game that isnt just an appetizer for a Legends game which ends up being as mediocre. Just ditch the idea of two ""remakes"" at once and make one good remake.Some people may like Arceus. I am not one of them and I hope they dont drag the remake bait for longer than needed.At this point I want just a BW1+2 bundle with BDSP style graphics BUT without inferior to the originals content + a bit extra content. Maybe developed together with Game Freak B team and NO Legends game as a follow up. Sounds budget but with the current technical issues SV had and with the Switch 2 on the horizon I would prefer them saving ressources."
2024-02-26T22:23:24+0000,I’m personally glad they didn’t include any Wild Area areas in Sinnoh. The Wild Area in SwSh felt very empty and boring. Also glad they didn’t force Dynamax into Sinnoh as I’m not a fan of the gimmick. Definitely would’ve like SwSh’s art style at least though. That’s my main gripe with BDSP.
2024-02-26T23:09:44+0000,"Unfortunately that’s how the world works. We cannot reasonably appease everyone. Whatever the announcement is regarding the core series is tomorrow will be a disappointment to a section of the fan base. This is regardless of it is a new Legends-style game, a remake, a brand new series, more SV DLC, or anything else. Myself, I’ll just watch and be excited to continue playing the next chapter of a game that has been around since I was 6 years old."
2024-02-26T23:12:42+0000,"They would've had to heavily change the Sinnoh region's layout to fit one in, unless they decided to turn the Great Marsh into one. So, no wonder they decided to put that in the Underground instead, but I wished they didn't completely neuter Secret Bases in the process."
2024-02-27T00:48:11+0000,I can't be the only one who finds it strange if they go back to Unova and/or Johto before going back to the least used Kalos region. Why go back to Unova which already had it's sequels?
2024-02-27T00:58:43+0000,Because they are going in order and Unova comes before Kalos. The Unova sequels don’t count because they were released during the era/timeframe of gen 5. Like Emerald was for gen 3 and USUM for gen 7 etc.
2024-02-27T01:03:35+0000,"It only made sense for the first 4 regions since at the time they didn't have any remakes or sequals. Unova is a special case where it got its extra games early.  The problem with all of this, is that right now every other region has had years upon years of being in the games.Kalos got one exact year. Yippee? It's as if GameFreak is trying to forget that region ever happened. Ash-Greninja got retconned, XYZ legends all were kept out of SV. Every following region got sequels or DLC.  Plus with gen 10 coming up, why not complete the first 9 generations by having every region being estentially completed by Kalos being the last region left to finally get its way overdue sequals/Legends game.If they want to do Unova regardless then Legends of Kyurem and the real main series games being XY sequals or prequels is the best solution."
2024-02-27T01:44:34+0000,"I predict that at least one of the following will be announced tomorrow:- ILCA-developed remakes of B/W- Pokémon Legends: Kyurem (or Keldeo)- new DLC for S/V that gives us access to northeastern Paldea- Gen 1 games for NSO, with eventual compatibility with Pokémon HOME- a brand-new and completely unexpected spinoff game"
2024-02-27T02:04:36+0000,"I think that there might not be any more Legends games, and that Legends Arceus was just a one off."
2024-02-27T02:09:27+0000,"To me BW2 are “extra” in the same way that all of the previous regions got an upgraded version of itself, like Emerald, Platinum etc. Of course BW2 had a completely different story, there’s no denying that, but still…it works similarly by adding a few locations and features like the third installment usually does. If they had received a third version at the time (instead of BW2). Would you still see it as weird that they might get remakes?I think the reason why Kalos got only one set of pokemon games is due to specific circumstances, not because they didn’t want to give them a third version. The fandom has already discussed that for years so I’m not going to delve into that, but I’m sure Kalos will get its turn in the future."
2024-02-27T04:19:42+0000,"https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1762314955775213582Sooo... 13-ish minutesThat does not make me very hopeful, if they gonna showcase news of the mobile games too that's just too little.Maybe we gonna get just a namedrop for the new console games? A small 30 seconds teaser? hm..."
2024-02-27T04:38:12+0000,The actual runtime of the Pokemon Presents broadcast will be between thirty and fourty minutes. That’s what I’m hoping for.10 minutes for new game announcementsAnother 10 minutes for announcements of Switch ports15-20 minutes for something else
2024-02-27T04:43:24+0000,"This is a bit of an overreaction. The one in 2022 that revealed Scarlet and Violet was only a minute longer. Every other Switch game has had an announcement trailer that was at least 1:30. In fact, BDSP was the only one that short. The others were about 3 minutes."
2024-02-27T04:59:38+0000,I just wish they don't waste all that precious time with a long intro......like they always do.
2024-02-27T05:10:34+0000,Konichiwa! Welcome to this year's Pokémon Day direct! So let me start off by telling you all the story of my life! It all started when I was born...!
2024-02-27T05:42:28+0000,"So guys, my theory:https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1762350756978409636TL;DR: Johto and Unova remakes this year, and BW3 and Johto 1970 next year.I believe the BW remake might be, a single version, and maybe Johto will also be a new title introducing a new Legendary.I don't care if it's chibi, 2D, or whatever, it just shouldn't be lazy copies of the originals.One thing I didn't mention in my thread, I have theorized for a long time the Original Dragon has four arms. If it has six limbs, could Khu's tweet about ""bug mascot when?"" be about the Original Dragon?And if the Original Dragon is Dragon/Water, its tail might be a watermill."
2024-02-27T05:42:55+0000,"Now you know they will. lolWe know how this works:1. Ishihara is gonna give a long, drawn-out statement of how much he loves running a billion-dollar company, then he's gonna let some American dude speak about nothing.2. After that, he's gonna let a random person make announcements for all the mobile games.3. Then, another random person is gonna announce a spin-off title.4. Finally, Ohmori's gonna pop up and give a 90-second speech about ""the new direction of Pokémon,"" and then show the trailer for the newest core series title that everyone's gonna complain about but buy anyway."
2024-02-27T08:05:42+0000,"I think we need a new international rule of the internet: it doesn’t matter what we’re discussing or the facts on the ground, every Pokemon discussion must/will include at least one complaint of “why no Kalos”.It’s maddening."
2024-02-27T08:39:38+0000,"Well given the reach of Pokémon and how diverse the player base is that’s inevitable. For example, my ideal scenario would be a gap year(although I don’t think will happen) which would upset the huge part of the player base that just want as much Pokemon content as possible."
2024-02-27T09:38:42+0000,"And if there is nothing to be disappointed about, I will be disappointed about not being disappointed!"
2024-02-27T10:47:30+0000,I think almost everyone would be disappointed if we got another let's go game lol.
2024-02-27T11:39:50+0000,"My expectations have sunk so low with every passing generation, I'd be completely okay with that.2D-HD Black & White collection would be amazing though."
2024-02-27T11:54:49+0000,Gen 9 remakes in the Let's Go style pls it will be funny
2024-02-27T12:10:43+0000,"I'd be glad if let's go johto gets announced today not because I'm a big fan of let's go (will still play them tho), but because I really want the Unova remakes to be a Switch 2 title.In the meantime we could get a Black/White 1&2 port, so the ""remakes"" would be BW3. That would be the very best scenario for me. (and next gen get's delayed until 2026, another win in my book)"
2024-02-27T12:30:46+0000,"Same, but I bought BDSP anyways, anyone wanna care to know why? To learn a 2nd language lol. Play it in Spanish, next to my laptop, and type in the Spanish, read the English. Remake video games are a nice way to learn another language. However I haven't even finished it. And then trying to ace through the game with just 3 Pokemon."
2024-02-27T13:11:23+0000,I think that a Celebi centered Legends game could work out very well. We do know that Johto is centuries old and has a lot of historic sites. I’d like to see the Burned Tower before the fire in its full glory and Ecruteak would look stunning in the Legends art style.
2024-02-27T13:38:58+0000,Thanks for this. I’m not going to be able to watch the Presents until later on so this will help avoid the inevitable wave of people covering the news.
2024-02-27T13:43:11+0000,"I'm at work rn so I will not be able to watch it live unfortunately but I'll still follow the news on twitter and hereevents like this are always fun in a way, hope we have a good one"
2024-02-27T13:52:47+0000,"I too want a gap year, but I want 2025 to be that year.The year before an anniversary should always be silent, imo."
2024-02-27T13:54:59+0000,I just got home from working the night shift and I'm so tired but I want to stay awake for like 20 more minutes to watch this thing.
2024-02-27T14:10:40+0000,its been pretty straightforward so farwe got 3 minutes leftif anything we're getting one more trailer/announcement
2024-02-27T14:15:04+0000,"This aged badly.Pokemon Legends Z. A Kalos region game.Kalos fans, congrats. I am actually stunned!"
2024-02-27T14:15:30+0000,A new Legends game set in Kalos?! I think I know someone on this forum who's gonna be very happy.
2024-02-27T14:15:50+0000,"Well happy that it's another Legends game, but damn did I not expect Kalos. Either way I'm fine with it since Kalos always felt like it got the short end of the stick with just the initial games and no follow ups.Edit: Also happy they're holding it off until 2025."
2024-02-27T14:16:07+0000,They pulled one hell of a u-turn on us. lol Gen 6???
2024-02-27T14:16:10+0000,"It’s actually incredible. Left field or what???Either way, I am actually hyped, Kalos was a beautiful region and if it follows the legends formula this will be properly amazing."
2024-02-27T14:16:37+0000,They skipped Gen 5. WHAT!? Haha. I just can't get over this.
2024-02-27T14:16:40+0000,Hahahahahaha like I said no one knows anything about games before they are announcedGet in!!! Kalos baby about time potential was never fulfilled
2024-02-27T14:16:58+0000,"I will be eating humble pie for sometime, for sure!"
2024-02-27T14:17:05+0000,"Prediction: They're going to announce something else later in the year for a fall 2024 release. There's no way they aren't gonna have anything to release in the fall. I'm probably wrong, though."
2024-02-27T14:19:00+0000,"Castelia Sewers here we go. Edit: o Lumiose.Sounds like we'll definitely have some new pokemon of some sort, if even variants or whatever."
2024-02-27T14:19:02+0000,I hope we get abilities this time around because megas without abilities would be awful.
2024-02-27T14:19:09+0000,All those Unown and the Legendary Beast... I thought it was leading to a Let's Go Johto game.
2024-02-27T14:19:35+0000,"Happy for all the Kalos fans and it was a region that got the short end of the stick.But I'm kinda disappointed that it was neither Johto or Unova, my two favourite regions and both being the only ones not in a 3D game."
2024-02-27T14:20:31+0000,Maybe we’ll finally get Eternal Floette. I mean they went out of their way to give it animation and stats and even 3D models and Dex entries and it’d be a total waste not to use them
2024-02-27T14:21:09+0000,"also i fall for it too, but i am thinking we need to actually ignore khu now"
2024-02-27T14:21:36+0000,"They always break their own patterns! How many times have we been blind sided like this lol.I am amazed there’s nothing about Nintendo online versions of the old game boy games though.Legends Z gives us an opportunity to have new Kalos Pokemon, surely?"
2024-02-27T14:21:49+0000,"Though I'm a little bummed we aren't getting a title this year, I am glad that we're getting a Kalos title, since it's located right next to Paldea.Hopefully, Legends Z-A connects the two regions."
2024-02-27T14:22:42+0000,Wait what about Unova?And why do they skip Unova or Johto straight to Kalos?
2024-02-27T14:22:52+0000,"I mean, this is not exactly a bad thing for Unova fans. It means the BW remakes will probably come out for the Switch 2 which will definetly have better graphics (imagine how pretty castelia will look)."
2024-02-27T14:23:58+0000,"Because of the rampant complaints by fans that Kalos never got a ""Z"" or any followup for that matter unlike all the other regions, so they finally decided to throw Kalos fans a bone."
2024-02-27T14:24:05+0000,Probably saving more development time for BW. And potentially the inclusion of B2W2. Gen 5 is a huge game if you think about it.
2024-02-27T14:25:50+0000,"I'm pretty happy with how this turned out. BW Remakes for switch 2 is a very good thing (we ARE getting back to Unova one way or another, eventually).Very curious about how a legends game will play out in a modern setting. Can't wait for another six months of radio silence about the game now, sigh."
2024-02-27T14:26:11+0000,"I nearly had a heart attack when i finally realized it was lumiose in the trailer.Totally was not expecting this, but totally hyped."
2024-02-27T14:26:21+0000,"One can only hope. lolI do wonder how the game will go, because it appears rather modern compared to Legends Arceus. I just want AZ to blast a hole into the Crater of Paldea. Just give me that.My sentiments exactly. Though I would've liked a Gen 5 game, at least now we know it holds a chance at being better than before."
2024-02-27T14:26:28+0000,"So the elemental monkeys, Patrat/Watchog, and Furfrou will finally be available on the Switch."
2024-02-27T14:26:29+0000,Yeah. It would be difficult to remake due to it being the only games in the series to get sequels.
2024-02-27T14:26:52+0000,Well... That certainly came out of left field. Where's our resident Kalos-phile? This is her moment!
2024-02-27T14:27:08+0000,There's a good probability that Pokemon Z was already started on (in the 3DS) and it's mostly converting it to Switch. I imagine many of the ideas have been around too.
2024-02-27T14:28:17+0000,"There are so many things left in XY unexplored, like the other Power Plants, and the Rhyhorn Race. They can potentially expand Southern Kalos as well."
2024-02-27T14:28:27+0000,"Yeah, I'm predicting the same formula as PLA; regional dex will include all Pokémon introduced that generation(can't wait for Furfrou to wreck havoc on GTS by the way), with a bit of a changeup with the rest of the dex, + a few regional variants/evolutions."
2024-02-27T14:30:03+0000,"Well, aside from this being a Legends game, I don’t think anyone saw this coming ._."
2024-02-27T14:30:30+0000,"Maybe Mega Evolutions for Alola, Galar, & Paldea pokemon?"
2024-02-27T14:30:47+0000,"I'm actually surprised and looking forward to it.I was looking forward to Gen V remake because they were my least favorite games, mostly due to how pixelated everything was and the 3D and camera direction always looked awkward, and kinda pushed me away from Pokemon for a bit. But I really did want to see a ""proper"" remake and go through it again. If we do get it for Switch 2 with BW/2 + more, I can't complain.Gen II, it was farfetched. Would've been fun but unless it was a Legends game, I'm not too stressed.Now, Gen VI holds a special place in my heart. It reignited my passion in the games, they weren't bad games, a little easy, but they were fun. XY clearly needed that 3rd title that got shafted into oblivion and we got poor Zygarde made into a stupid cell quest in SM/USUM.Plus, ORAS. Never goes wrong there.I'm gonna lock in Torchic as a starter hopefully. Idk about a regional variant because you'd have to put a Mega on top of it."
2024-02-27T14:31:12+0000,2025 so does that mean Switch 2 launch title? Because they didn't show any footage either...
2024-02-27T14:32:59+0000,トップページ『Pokémon LEGENDS Z-A』公式サイト。『ポケットモンスター』シリーズの新たな挑戦作！ 2025年世界同時発売！www.pokemon.co.jpOfficial JP site calls it a Switch title.
2024-02-27T14:35:39+0000,The official Pokémon  Twitter page states that the title will be released onSwitch systemsin 2025.That plural is very telling. lol
2024-02-27T14:36:27+0000,Personal prediction: Switch ports of the Gen 1-7 games will be coming later this year since there’s no new game planned for 2024.
2024-02-27T14:37:08+0000,"It possibly might end up being a January release to line-up with Legends: Arceus release time.And the you have Pokemon Day Feb, and Switch 2 titles in Holiday Season.Switch 2 is slated for Q2 so a bit into the year already and I can't see them having so little time between releases again.Might get a performance enhancement patch for Switch 2 if anything."
2024-02-27T14:37:13+0000,"Renamed the thread. I already asked Serebii to make a subforum, so please use this thread for discussions."
2024-02-27T14:37:59+0000,"Can't wait for Incineroar to be a starter and get a Mega, and completely destroy competitive Pokemon forever"
2024-02-27T14:42:32+0000,"I think that this game was meant to be the Breath of the Wild of the Switch 2, and it will release on both the original Switch and the Switch 2, and that's the reason why it's not coming in 2024."
2024-02-27T14:42:37+0000,That's crazy we might not get anything this year besides Mighty Raids.
2024-02-27T14:43:30+0000,Kalos finallyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyThey skipped Unova heheKalos comes first
2024-02-27T14:43:53+0000,Janejane6178 must be losing their mind right about now.
2024-02-27T14:44:15+0000,Hopefully the game will let us follow AZ and also explain Zygarde’s role in Kalos. It’s just there with no explanation or even a hint of a connection to Yveltal and Xerneas. Plus I’m excited to be able to use the Shiny Furfrou that I caught in X during my first play through and accidentally put into Home when I did a transfer from Bank because I forgot I had stored it there for safety reasons. And Eternal Floette had better be released as there was way too much work for it to be cast aside for absolutely nothing. Kalos always did feel extremely incomplete.
2024-02-27T14:47:11+0000,I am actually fine with that if it means more time for development. Just wish we had a nice battle facility to spend our time on while waiting for a new title.
2024-02-27T14:47:41+0000,I'm good with this.Let this game cook some before you release it lmao
2024-02-27T14:49:07+0000,What if we get to participate in the Kalos war? There is so much potential with the Legends game besides the Mega Evolution lore.
2024-02-27T14:50:17+0000,And kinda confirms new console will be called Switch 2 or something
2024-02-27T14:51:20+0000,"TheNoA Twitter account says the game is set ENTIRELY on Lumiose City. Curious how that works for obtaining Pokemon, Mega Evolution, and the Zygarde storyline."
2024-02-27T14:51:58+0000,I don’t think GF would let us go into a full blown war due to it being a series meant to be played by players of all ages and ratings reasons. I mean the Game Corner has been completely removed since Platinum because of concerns it would cause younger players to develop a gambling addiction and the Gambler trainer was changed to be Gamer in FRLG.
2024-02-27T14:53:02+0000,"I wonder what kind of clothes we will get. I can already imagine how many cute outfits not-Serena will get. There is so much potential for vintage french clothes, maybe some inspiration from Chanel?Though the trailer didn't exactly made it clear whether the game will be set on the past or future. Perhaps it's both, since the first part showed a rather old sketch while the second part had a futuristic look to it."
2024-02-27T14:55:45+0000,"Zygarde reveals itself whenever the ecosystem is about to be thrown into irreversible disarray. Given how high-tech Lumiose is looking here, that's pretty much going to be the main message here, and Lumiose simply gets too big to sustain.Would be funny if they spun that on its head though. Set this in the past like PLA, and Lumiose simply got too big too fast, and Zygarde came up to wreck it. Then the humans finally get the message and scale the project back, leading to the Lumiose we see in XY. Set state Z back to state A."
2024-02-27T14:57:03+0000,Interesting. I suppose this is the chance to finally have a full scale city in a Pokemon game
2024-02-27T14:57:42+0000,"I was not expecting another Legends game at all, but I absolutely welcome it! This is awesome! And to think we're gonna see Megas again! Since Mega Evolution was introduced, we've added 304 Pokemon. Its exciting to think about if any older or newer Pokemon will get any."
2024-02-27T14:58:38+0000,"Gen 6 Pokemon might finally know what mega evolution is(Diancie is no longer alone in that department) Hopefully, some gen 5 get to receive some mega as well.Florges line may play a bigger role this time so I think they may receive a new form. I want some Gen 6 to have a new evo as well, esp Klefki, Heliolisk, Diggersby, Hawlucha’s new form, etc."
2024-02-27T15:00:15+0000,ok legends ZA is definitely going to be a city planner game if its only in Lumioseits also screaming switch 2 entry title.
2024-02-27T15:02:33+0000,"From what I can guess with the Urban Development plan , this is either taking place in the future, or it’s taking place in the past showing how Lumiose City became the way it was portrayed in X & Y"
2024-02-27T15:02:58+0000,"Eternal Floette exists. We know it exists as it was AZ’s original partner and there was a lot of data left in the Gen VI and VII games for it including a moveset, its very own signature move, stats, and even Dex entries. And then Home has 3D models of it."
2024-02-27T15:03:39+0000,"I mean, Yo-kai watch did it before with yo-kais being spread out through a huge city but the weird thing is that the main differential about Legends from other main series games is that pokémon can attack the trainer. Lumiose would be a pretty chaotic city if that was the case but the town itself shows no sign of rampanging pokémon in the trailer. So i am rather confused because without those mechanics, it wouldn't really feel like a sucessor to Legends?"
2024-02-27T15:05:17+0000,"I'm betting we're gonna get new Mega Evolutions. Hoping among them that we get Mega Charizard Z, Mega Mewtwo Z, Mega Feraligatr, Mega Serperior, and Mega Incineroar. And yes, I do think we're gonna get another set of mixed-and-matched starters from Johto, Unova and Alola."
2024-02-27T15:07:03+0000,I’m thinking that Yveltal and Xerneas will get Megas or at least one additional form change to be able to go head to head with Zygarde.
2024-02-27T15:07:42+0000,"It might be something where, instead of just researching Pokemon, we catch Pokemon in order to help build up Lumios. Will Kalos still be called Kalos? Whose ancestors will we meet? And will the Player be Serena/Calem from the future or their ancestors?"
2024-02-27T15:08:58+0000,"I doubt that's the only place we'll be in, unless they massively expand the city, ala Los Santos in GTA5.I gather the game will be set in Lumiose, but we'll still travel to other areas, as we did in Legends Arceus."
2024-02-27T15:09:42+0000,"I think the focus will be re-developing it but it'll take place across Kalos. Z is in the title, so Zygarde is most certainly gonna have a role."
2024-02-27T15:09:44+0000,I think we need to emphasize that this is a RE-development of Lumiose City. So it's definitely set in the modern times. I even saw an NPC with rollerskates in the background.
2024-02-27T15:10:07+0000,^ Hope the city will at least have some parks.And probably more reasons to expand Castelia Sewers.
2024-02-27T15:11:07+0000,I was not expecting Kalos but while it's a surprise it's not an unwelcome one. Interesting how the trailer has a completely different visual style of trailer. Hard to know what to expect given the teaser gave very little away. Some parts looked like it was all part of a virtual world and some parts had a hand drawn stye. Not sure what to expect.
2024-02-27T15:12:53+0000,perhaps Zygarde's power causes some environmental change to the area?
2024-02-27T15:13:25+0000,"To me it seemed like it was developing the city into what it looks like now. Going with the idea that Legends games are set in the past, it could be a Pokemon version of the Reconstruction of Paris in the 1800s"
2024-02-27T15:13:26+0000,"Paris underwent massive renovations in the late 1800s, which is around the same time the Meiji period started (the time PLA is set in). I'd say it's more likely it's in the past, especially since they say (in the blurb on the website) it's about rebuilding the city to accomodate both humans and Pokemon. We also saw large Pokemon like Onix and Gyarados in the city. To me it seems like the reconstruction will be to allow Pokemon of all sizes to live in the city and bond with people."
2024-02-27T15:14:10+0000,Or the reconstruction efforts are harming the ecosystem which brings Zygarde out of hiding
2024-02-27T15:14:14+0000,"This is nice, I've always had a soft spot for X and Y, and it's great that we're getting a legends game set in Kalos. If it follows a similar structure to Legands: Arceus, I'm guessing the Pokedex will consist of all (or at least the majority) of the Pokemon from the original Kalos Pokdedex, along with a handful of new regional variants if we're still doing those, and a couple of surprises thrown in like perhaps a new Legendary. With this in mind, I'm definitely excited to re-create some of my old X and Y teams."
2024-02-27T15:16:06+0000,Klingklangklangklangklangklangklangklang debut on switch omg. That episode from Pokemon Journeys is the foreshadow of it all lol
2024-02-27T15:19:55+0000,"I hoped Kalos' new instalment would take longer to happen so the chances of a Mega Butterfree would be higher. This close to G-MAX, I think the chances are very slim.I skipped PLA, I really don't care about Kalos and I fully hoped Scarlet would be my last Pokémon game. But since they are going to release one more game for the Switch, I might end up going for it anyways. To early to know, let's wait and see..."
2024-02-27T15:21:24+0000,"Yeah I'm with with it too. More space for dev time and more gap in between games and generations.I think it's more that, they could've just spaced out Teal Mask and Indigo Disc more now lol."
2024-02-27T15:21:26+0000,2025 release it very much could be on a new console too like what happened with BOTW
2024-02-27T15:24:02+0000,So Gen 10 is 100% going to be in 2026 for the 30th anniversary right?
2024-02-27T15:24:15+0000,"pardon the double postbut the Unown at the end spelled out ""Soeywe ?""anybody know if thats a anagram or anything?oh wait its See you, never mind"
2024-02-27T15:24:45+0000,IDK. I think that there is a possibility that 2025 is like 2022 in that we get two separate main series games in one year.
2024-02-27T15:25:20+0000,Well In the real world a French inventor patented a three-wheeled inline skate model in Paris in 1819 (and earlier versions did exist). So it could still be an old redevelopment if the Pokemon world is somewhat similar time linewise.At this stage hard to rule anything out.
2024-02-27T15:26:05+0000,No in-game footage as well. The next Present is in August typically so a while to wait it seems.Loose disclaimer saying sorry you got your hopes up for Gen II/V remakes
2024-02-27T15:26:56+0000,"That would make sense that they get something, like the Starters in Legends Arceus got.I wanna see a Regional Form get a mega evolution. Like Mega Alola Muk, or Mega Hisui Electrode"
2024-02-27T15:28:26+0000,"Going to be a January release or they would've announced it next year in the direct.BW remakes getting postponed was possible, I mean Johto was the region we havent seen the longest. And then surprise  its Kalos. What a weird choice for the current release history. Will we  ever get ""normal XY"" remakes now? And what region will be revisited next? Now its a totally chaotic.And yeah, no Unova double remake with a Legends Kyurem this gen. Maybe a BDSP style remake for late 2025 but coming with that chibi remake when the Switch 2 is already out? Nah, then it needs to be a classic remake like HG/SS but maybe they want to save some ressources? Then give us a SV enhancement version, that would fit quite good between ZA and Gen 10.But hey we are probably getting a 4 years gen again. I dont think they would have the nuts to release ZA early 2025 and a brand new gen on a new systen within the first year of the Switch successor. And a third gen on the Switch is also highly unlikely, otherwise they would introduce the first new gen for the new console almost four years into the lifecycle.Early 2025 Legends ZA, late 2025 a SV enhancement, late 2026 gen 10.As for another Legends game...maybe they will fix the flaws of Arceus? Maybe?"
2024-02-27T15:30:30+0000,"Technological development is neither uniform nor linear. The first cannons were used in the 13th century, well before France got around to using them. The first computer was developed in Ancient Greece. I can see the Pokemon equivalent of Paris being further along in development than the equivalent of Hokkaido.Not for nothing, but the Olympics is being held in Paris this year. Seems like an opportune time to get more info, around August."
2024-02-27T15:30:51+0000,"I think that Legends ZA will come out in March of 2025 (as a launch title for the Switch 2) with Gen 10 following right behind in November 2025, and then in 2026 we just get the DLC for Gen 10."
2024-02-27T15:33:54+0000,"I agree it's probably going to be an early year release, but the fact they are announcing it now doesn't necessarily equate to that.It could simply be because the fanbase is used to game announcements on February and having nothing new to show now would trigger a **** storm."
2024-02-27T15:36:16+0000,"I considered Gen 9 as a whole to be my last generation where I obsess over pokémon & most likely leave the franchise, so while Kalos isn’t my favorite region, for me personally this game feels like the perfect send off.It perfectly encapsulates how I feel the most predictable thing about Game Freak is that they’re unpredictable"
2024-02-27T15:40:32+0000,"Well that was really unexpected. I know I’m in the minority but the Legends games aren’t really my thing, but I’m willing to give it the benefit of the doubt."
2024-02-27T15:41:12+0000,"So, Piplup because it evolves into Napoleon.Snivy because Serperior has the fluer-de-lis, the national flower of France, on its design.The third would be...?"
2024-02-27T15:42:36+0000,"Note also: The wording between Pokemon social media and Nintendo of America is inconsistent. Pokemon social media says set within, but Nintendo of America says entirely. Its hard to believe they'd focus ONLY on this location and its even hard to believe they'd be able to make a Legends style game just within the confines of this single city."
2024-02-27T15:42:41+0000,Charizard so it can Mega Evolve into Mega Charizard Z
2024-02-27T15:44:33+0000,I think that this game might straight up remove catching Pokémon entirely and you just get given Pokémon as rewards for completing various sidequests throughout the city.
2024-02-27T15:46:22+0000,"I mean Yakuza games are set in a single city and they are pretty complete RPGs (at least the last 2 numbered ones), with monster catching even.I'm not saying it WILL be set entirely in lumiose, it may be miscommunication, but it seems completely possible to me."
2024-02-27T15:47:19+0000,Interesting trailer we saw of a virtual blueprint.
2024-02-27T15:49:00+0000,They didn't skip anything. Unova got a entire Academy with a Elite 4 based in it and a HUGE school biome. So it is only fair Kalos gets next.
2024-02-27T15:49:38+0000,Yeah I'd say they'd have to wait for people to adopt the new system first so if Switch 2 launches Mar 25 then Gen 10 November 26 seems perfectly reasonable to me!
2024-02-27T15:52:43+0000,What are the odds this game is so good that it makes you rediscover your passion for the franchise?
2024-02-27T15:53:08+0000,"It's possible, but not exactly in the way you might think. It's still possible that after Legends Z-A, will be when we get either new versions of Johto or remakes of Black and White 1, maybe even both."
2024-02-27T15:53:56+0000,"For the sake of fairness, I would like it to be either Chikorita/Tepig/Popplio or Totodile/Snivy/Litten.First trio fits Kalos better, but I don't really care about them.Second trio not a great fit (plus Feraligatr so close to Skeledirge), but those were my starter picks from their respective regions so I would like it."
2024-02-27T15:54:59+0000,Janejane for the next year and a half now that Kalos has been vindicated
2024-02-27T15:55:10+0000,I'm hoping it won't have to be a launch title exclusive. I already purchased SWITCH with PS5 just for this christmas (after a few years of skipping) Consoles are SO expensive even for a new game
2024-02-27T15:55:33+0000,"Holy crap, we're going back to Kalos?  I don't think anyone saw this coming.  Either way I'm excited.  Can't wait to see what starters we get."
2024-02-27T15:57:58+0000,This was the plot twist of a thousand years! I am happy to see Kalos again.
2024-02-27T15:58:04+0000,"The launch date must be January 2025, so next years' Presents could be dedicated to the next generation now that '24 is confirmed to be a gap year."
2024-02-27T15:58:16+0000,"I guess the way Mega Evolutions work in this game would be similar to Let's Go; By having the corresponding Mega Stone in your bag rather than have a Pokemon hold them.Also, I've been pondering hypothetical possibilities for this upcoming game:1. Alternate Starter Pokemon from the Kalos and Kanto Starters.2. New Regional forms or Mega Evolved forms of existing Pokemon.3. Possible New Pokemon.4. New clothing5. Events and clothing added by having saved data from past titles, such as Hoopa and Volcanion.6. Poke Ball variations.Of course, with the introduction of visible size variations in all Pokemon since Legends: Arceus, I've been thinking how this would affect Pumpkaboo and Gougeist."
2024-02-27T15:58:54+0000,"It isn't, the trailer already shows it's coming for Switch.If it will also have a Switch 2 version or not is up to question (GF putting that much work? I doubt it), but for Switch is already confirmed."
2024-02-27T15:59:49+0000,Blaziken could be a possibility. A rooster was a symbol of France and Blaziken might sort of count for that. Though that is 2 bird starters in the same region if they go for Empoleon.
2024-02-27T15:59:52+0000,"I pressed the ignore button on that one long ago.Let's see. Fenekin, Chespin, Froakie, our starter, Lucario, just need one more."
2024-02-27T16:00:44+0000,"This doesn't automatically denote a modern setting. In fact, nothing in the trailer suggests a 'new' Lumiose.It seems more plausible that the current Lumiose Citythe redevelopment, and the game will take place prior to the creation of the Lumiose we know."
2024-02-27T16:02:11+0000,"Really, I'm just happy we are getting one more game on the base switchBe cool if that was the case.  Torchic is my favorite fire starter and would definitely be my pick."
2024-02-27T16:03:13+0000,I think it’s pretty likely the first Legends cane out in January because of BDSP.So I can’t see them repeating that for no reason.
2024-02-27T16:08:15+0000,"Oh my god from page 15 to 22. What is going on? We are going to Kalos? not what I was expecting, but exited nonetheless lol"
2024-02-27T16:12:35+0000,"Depends on how good this game is. I’m already hyped, but I’m still waiting for a trailer to show the story & gameplay. Plus, since it’s coming out next year, hopefully it won’t have all of the bugs/glitches that SV had.Though in all honesty, this will probably be my last game where I’m actively engaged in Pokémon. I’ll still probably play the games, but it’ll most likely just be casually, & I’ll still leave the forums, stop playing Go, & not be as involved with the community unless Gen 10 really wins me over. I’m going to be in my mid-late 30s once Gen 10 rolls around, so while I’ll never completely leave pokémon I still feel like I have to let a part of it go.That being said, I’m still excited for this game. Kalos isn’t my favorite region but I did develop a soft spot since I did do a playthrough during the pandemic since I never played the games all the way through before. Plus, I was upset that we didn’t get Pokémon Z when Gen 6 was in its prime, so this was LONG overdue!!!"
2024-02-27T16:12:39+0000,"Either there is a still unannounced game for late 2024 or the more likely scenario there is a game they plan for late 2025, maybe as a Switch 2 warm up like Lets Go or something else that doesnt take much time to do. Not profiting of the holiday season TWICE in a row is unimaginable."
2024-02-27T16:18:53+0000,"I'm going to guess Clemont takes a bigger role here, if he's still around.And if it's set in the future, he and Bonnie may be older."
2024-02-27T16:19:56+0000,They'd have to GREATLY expand on the city cause going off of what it was in XY is not enough for an entire game.
2024-02-27T16:20:52+0000,"Blaziken already has a Mega Evolution, so I don't think it'll be part of the mixed and matched starters. But for that same reason, it is possible that we'll get the Hoenn starters alongside them.Also, I just realized that there was a hint to Legends Z-A in Scarlet and Violet. Paldea is based on Spain, Kalos is based on France, and both of the real-life countries are neighbors geographically."
2024-02-27T16:22:24+0000,I think the bigger hint was that the Kalos legendaries weren’t included in the Indigo Disk
2024-02-27T16:23:45+0000,"Note that the trailer says ""2025"", without specifying further, unlike PLA's reveal trailer, which said ""Early 2022"".From what we know, Pokémon Legends: Z-A could release on November 2025."
2024-02-27T16:24:08+0000,"To be fair, with how much lore was left unexplored, Kalos needed this more than Unova and Johto.Maybe we'll find out who ""The one"" is and the secret behind the message on the board. We'll almost certainly find out about Zygarde. Maybe we'll get to explore Parfume palace."
2024-02-27T16:26:16+0000,I don't think so as I think if that was the case they wouldn't have revealed it now and instead saved it for the 2025 Pokémon Presents.
2024-02-27T16:27:21+0000,"Announcing a game one year prior to release is the perfect opportunity to build loads of hype, especially since we (seemingly) won't have any mainline game this year, not even an outsourced one."
2024-02-27T16:28:34+0000,"The Kalos trio IS still missing its Ratotoskr in its World Tree inspiration setup. We might get the little squirrel here.Drop the first R to make the name Atotoskr, and you have the A in ""Z-A"" even."
2024-02-27T16:28:51+0000,Pokemon Z at last! Well sort of. And we get the year off too.
2024-02-27T16:36:58+0000,"Hmm. We’re back in France, so could the Swords of Justice (and possibly their Paradoxes?) be involved somehow?"
2024-02-27T16:37:55+0000,"We got the Forces of Nature (including a new member) in Hisui, so I wouldn't be surprised."
2024-02-27T16:42:31+0000,"Oh, I just realized. Trevor, Tierno, and Shauna's ancestors might appear here and be of some use. Maybe Shauna's ancestor will be the ultimate evil or maybe her ancestor was a princess. I could see Shauna's ancestor being a princess, Shauna certainly acts like a sheltered princess sometimes. Maybe her ancestor was a warrior princess.Trevor will probably have a professor for an ancestor. Some things are just meant to be.Tierno... he probably had a warrior ancestor.As funny as it would be if all three had ancestors who were useless, I do want them to have story importance. They were Pokemon's first attempt at giving the player in game friends. I have truly fond memories of making them call me mistress. Also, as an added bonus, if their ancestors do something noteworthy then we can make jokes about them."
2024-02-27T16:44:57+0000,I’m definitely looking forward to AZ and eternal Floette.
2024-02-27T16:47:46+0000,"So, I suppose this is the basis for the game, right?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haussmann's_renovation_of_Paris"
2024-02-27T16:51:42+0000,"****ing finally means we don't need to trade Swirlix, Spritzee, Phantump and Pumpkaboo to evovle."
2024-02-27T16:57:10+0000,"My sentiments exactly. There simply isn't enough to justify setting an entire Pokémon in one town.The only town in the entire series that comes close is Mesagoza, and even that city isn't big enough for a whole game. They'd have to do some hardcore expansion for it. If they actually manage to pull it off, I'd be very impressed."
2024-02-27T16:57:33+0000,"Good Lord, the final boss against Zygarde is gonna be insane.  Considering its forms it could be in three stages with their own health bars."
2024-02-27T16:59:06+0000,Lol yeah this reminds me of Zygarde in Dynamax adventures killing my pokemon and NPC’s pokemon as well.
2024-02-27T17:10:22+0000,"I have to imagine that there'll be a few settlements besides Lumiose City, specifically Camphrier Town, which has a castle. Parfume Palace. And Shalour City, home to Mega Evolution. We'll probably only get a few small settlements. What'll probably happen is that we'll have to get the city to a certain rank before we can do certain story objectives.I really hope they do something with Parfume Palace. Such a pretty place, relegated to little more than a detour that added nothing to the plot. I wish to buy a fancy dress so that I may visit it."
2024-02-27T17:10:50+0000,Imagine they give the 100% form a Mega. Its on the table now that Megas are returning.
2024-02-27T17:12:32+0000,"not just that, we're looking at the new Spirtomb Wisp collectathon being Zygarde cells."
2024-02-27T17:15:33+0000,Can't Bonnie's ancestor just sing the Squishy song to calm it down?
2024-02-27T17:17:05+0000,Wonder if that means we'll get a caricature of Napoleon Bonaparte.Hope so. Plus maybe Pokemon whose evolutions require trading with a King's Rock.
2024-02-27T17:18:29+0000,lol at all the people saying Kalos wasn’t coming.@janejane6178won.
2024-02-27T17:21:16+0000,"I still am weirded out that they had to export the extra Kalos stuff to Alola, where it's not even related to Kalos at all."
2024-02-27T17:25:20+0000,The trailer could be just a fraction of the lumiose plan. There could still be kalos areas just like legends arceus did that you repeatedly return to progress the story
2024-02-27T17:28:24+0000,I didn't really put much stock in that since the Creation trio was in the Crown Tundra and then got their own games in the same generation.
2024-02-27T17:32:50+0000,It very much could be. They could even make it 4 stages if they start the battle with a Zygarde core or if they add some new form
2024-02-27T17:37:06+0000,Three? I'm thinking five:Phase 1: 10% ZygardePhase 2: 25% ZygardePhase 3: 50% ZygardePhase 4: 75% ZygardeFinal Phase: 100% Zygarde
2024-02-27T17:37:47+0000,For the available Pokemon I wonder if they would copy what Legends: Arceus did which is Sinnoh’s regional Dex (specifically mostly the extended Platinum Dex) and a few extras. Assuming we are using the Kalos regional Dex as a basis not sure if the game will include the ORAS Megas as it includes Rayquaza and another set of starters.If anything we can see Mega Metagross (if it is included) with the new metallic textures (just happened to have a second shiny Beldum in SV).
2024-02-27T17:42:43+0000,Do you guys think that Kalos will still be called Kalos? I think it will be but it's always possible that it had a different name.How funny would it be if this game was mercilessly hard compared to how easy X and Y were?
2024-02-27T17:44:12+0000,"one thing i noticed, is that the digital blueprints go back to a paper sketch at the endperhaps this is earlier Kalso planning on the redevelopment of Lumiose to modernize it into what we know.and what we see was just 'the vision' of it"
2024-02-27T17:45:25+0000,"France has been France for a very long time, unlike Hokkaido."
2024-02-27T17:47:25+0000,"Good for her, tbh.  Kalos was probably going to get some sort of remake eventually and it came earlier than expected."
2024-02-27T17:48:18+0000,"I know that as an adult I'm not necessarily the target audience here, but that scene just comes off as silly to me, like here we have a raging deity in the process of destroying the Pokemon world's version of France but some kid the deity befriended once turns on the waterworks and starts singing and the deity is like ""Oh, sorry, I'll be chill now.""?I'm not saying it would never happen if a real-world deity like Zeus got pissed off at something, decided to attack Paris, and some human child he befriended tried to talk him out of it, but if he's in such a blind rage then he's not in the right frame of mind to be reasoned with in that manner, realistically speaking."
2024-02-27T17:56:17+0000,"Yeah, it was a little goofy. I mean, I get that the song was a reminder of the good times Squishy had with Bonnie and that helped it break through the brainwashing, but if you really think about it, it really does take you out of the moment.Which, of course, is why I expect the game to do something similar to it."
2024-02-27T18:12:44+0000,While do have a hint that megas will be in this game there is a possibility that could also occur is new regional forms/evolutions/other new forms. While megas are likely the major focus I wouldn't rule it out completely that we get some more permanent additions as well.
2024-02-27T18:15:20+0000,"Reading the descriptions back, does it read like only Lumiose City is able to be travelled on…?Have I misinterpreted that?EDIT: Yeah, it is. Hmmmm.Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Gameplay, Release Date, Everything We Know So FarAll details, updates, release dates, and morewww.nintendolife.com"
2024-02-27T18:17:10+0000,we don't know truly the extentjust that Lumiose City will be a very heavy focus on the game
2024-02-27T18:27:52+0000,"The ""entirely on lumiose city"" could just mean that we won't be able to visit other cities, but will still be able to travel to another locations (to gather resources for the reconstruction, maybe?)but the way the teaser was presented, I'd say I believe in the whole game being inside Lumiose only"
2024-02-27T18:29:25+0000,"All I care about is getting an answer to one of these two questions:1. Who is ""the one""?2. What was up with that signboard?"
2024-02-27T18:42:41+0000,So I've seen some speculation for Piplup and Snivy for two of our starters.  Could someone fill me in on their connections to France?
2024-02-27T18:49:01+0000,Piplup line is not only inspired by Ocean myths (Poseidon and such) but also Napoleon.Snivy line is based off of the Fleur-De-Lis and French Aristocracy.
2024-02-27T18:50:39+0000,Empoleon has Napoleon as part of its inspiration and he’s a very famous French general. One of Serperior’s inspirations is from a manga set during the French Revolution
2024-02-27T18:53:38+0000,"Empoleon = Emperor = Napoleon???Serperior = the Regal PokemonNot sure about a potential fire type. I think we can rule out a few though, like Charizard (has 2 megas and I'm certain the starters for this game and probably the Kalos starters will get megas), Typhlosion (was in PLA), Blaziken (has a mega), Delphox (Kalos starter), Skeledirge (too new). So this leaves Infernape, Emboar, Incineroar, and Cinderace. EDIT: Can also rule out Infernape and Emboar since they are the same generations as Empoleon and Emboar."
2024-02-27T19:03:23+0000,"I only have one wish.Please, God, please no Mega Charizard Z. PLEASE."
2024-02-27T19:03:29+0000,I’m thinking Cinderace or Incineroar as they would avoid using Infernape if they use Empoleon and same goes for Emboar to avoid two starters from the same region. Cinderace turning into a musketeer with a fiery foil would be cool. It would be very fitting for Cinderace too as it is supposed to be based on an athlete and fencing is very popular in France and is historically linked to the nation. I can picture the red tuft of hair on its head becoming more feathery and fluffy and its ears form the base of the hat. Or they could do something unexpected and make it based off of Cinderella and the Prince for gender differences.
2024-02-27T19:05:50+0000,Oh yeah I didn't even think about them avoiding multiple starters from the same generation. I'll update my post with that.
2024-02-27T19:08:04+0000,"SpoilerFor real though. Super surprised they skipped Unova, but Honestly pretty excited. Interested to see what direction it takes, and glad to see the Legends brand will continue. Just wonder what kinda of time frame we're looking at for the setting."
2024-02-27T19:11:52+0000,I‘m happy to have a new Pokémon game in general and am glad to see Kalos getting some love given how incomplete Gen VI was. I still don’t understand where Zygarde fits into Kalos mythology or the Mortality Duo. It’s just there with abs no explanation. I would have even accepted a single NPC mentioning Zygarde protecting the ecosystem in XY.
2024-02-27T19:15:45+0000,"I feel like this is inevitable. It's coming no matter what, whether we want it or not."
2024-02-27T19:19:17+0000,Unova already has two sets of games so Kalos deserves it more
2024-02-27T19:39:34+0000,I really want them to do Mega Charizard Z simply because I want to see the fandom reaction to it. Would be fantastic
2024-02-27T19:40:29+0000,Mega Charizard ZDragon/Flying typeAbility-Fiery Spirit-Gives 50% boost to Fire type moves.
2024-02-27T19:45:52+0000,The evolutions went from orange to red back to orange? Well none of the Mega Charizards were red. Here's hoping a Mega Charizard Z would be red.
2024-02-27T19:51:56+0000,"O yea Hisui Pokedex was only 242. If this game is very similar, expect a small pokedex."
2024-02-27T19:57:18+0000,"Make it happen Game Freak, I want to see the outrage"
2024-02-27T19:58:15+0000,"Think I’ve over the initial hype. As someone who’s favorite Legendary and third favorite Pokèmon is Zygarde, I am very pleased with this. And they’re actually taking a break year for the first in just shy of a decade! Gives me a chance to catch up on my backlog. It being a Legends game is the perfect way to end this for me. Kalos being underdeveloped is a low hanging fruit in the community at this point so I’m glad to see that it’ll get a redemption. There’s a few other ideas I have about this game but I’ll save that for later once I’m off work.I am so glad it’s not Let’s Go lol. I would’ve taken a BDSP styled game over thatPlease. Mega Incineroar sounded like a fever dream but it could be a possibility."
2024-02-27T20:04:08+0000,"XY had the largest regional dex by far (457, compared to USUM, SwSh, and SV which were all around the 400 mark), I agree that we definitely should not expect anything on that size for PLZA.That said, I do hope there are more Pokémon than in PLA. The small dex was my biggest gripe with that game, and depending on how much PLZA builds on PLA a lot of the groundwork may already be in place."
2024-02-27T20:04:40+0000,"Wait until it's revealed, that Nov. 2024 will have a new Pokemon game, (like B/W 3), that was made by ILCA."
2024-02-27T20:08:21+0000,"I wonder if we will be able to visit Laverre or Snowbelle City, they would look beautiful with the switch graphics."
2024-02-27T20:09:05+0000,"I wouldn't be super surprised, but at this point I'm not really expecting it. IIRC USUM had a June reveal to November release turnaround in 2017"
2024-02-27T20:10:18+0000,"the twitter accounts is saying that the game will ENTIRELY be in Lumiose Citywhether or not that is true, I don't think we'll be seeing any other cities outside of this one"
2024-02-27T20:11:20+0000,"Also from the looks of TPCI Japan's Twitter, the title is closer to being pronounced as Pokemon Legends Zeta in english."
2024-02-27T20:11:33+0000,Perhaps the locations where those cities are supposed to be? Snowy and Autumn places?
2024-02-27T20:15:40+0000,"If they have areas like the ones in Indigo Disk, then I don't mind being confined to Lumiose City.  We will probably get a better look at how that will function in the next trailer(which won't be anytime soon, unfortunately)."
2024-02-27T20:18:01+0000,Hohhhh!! Is this going to be like GTA where it's just the city?
2024-02-27T20:18:29+0000,*good grief* if they make bosses and any noble bosses anywhere near that tough or even just 3 phases then the games better not have that glitch where you are unable to summon a pokemon into the battle.I never managed to finish PLA
2024-02-27T20:20:43+0000,"Yeah, I kinda find hard to believe that we won’t at least get some nature locations."
2024-02-27T20:23:42+0000,"One possibility is that this is set sometime after the war and what we're seeing is the survivors attempting to rebuild, hence there being no other towns/cities. I can't really think of too many reasons why we shouldn't have at least one small settlement outside of Lumios. After all, Kalos isn't exactly a new region."
2024-02-27T20:24:40+0000,"So what are we thinking about possible mega evolutions in the game?My guesses:-Most, if not all Pokemon that are available in game that can already mega evolve (from XY/ORAS)-The starters for this game-The Kalos starters assuming they aren't the actual starters-The legendary trio will get some form of mega evolution (see: Primal Groudon/Kyogre/Mega Rayquaza)-Flygon (lol just kidding)-Maybe Volcanion since it doesn't have a mega or alternate form?-Mega Charizard Z and Mega Charizard A (not really but I wouldn't put it past them)Any others?"
2024-02-27T20:25:59+0000,Or they could give Chesnaught and Delphox Bond Phenomenon forms
2024-02-27T20:28:40+0000,75% being based off of Sleipnir to finish the theme of Loki's children would be awesome.
2024-02-27T20:36:53+0000,"I kind of wonder how leaks will be handled going forward after this announcement.People were apprenshive about them for a while, and if they’re like me they’re probably also fed up with the drama between (ex- the Centro/Khu scenario), but since they all “claimed” we were getting Johto or Unova games (sometimes even both), I can’t see anyone really giving leaks any attention or paying any attention aside from the die hard fans"
2024-02-27T20:41:43+0000,"Khu will still have some diehard supporters who will bend over backwards to believe him, but it seems like his credibility is gone now. He almost certainly had a legit source at some point, but that has likely dried up by now."
2024-02-27T20:45:57+0000,he pulled out his leak about the codename for Pokemon Legends Z-A and now everyone is thinking his leaks are in relation to this game.
2024-02-27T20:50:59+0000,"Hey you know what would be interesting?If they some how normalized Inverse Battles as a battle mechanic like the Style Moves.Type Flipping moves? Type Changing Mega forms?New Alt Evolutions?Also reminder that the Z Axis moves both up and down, we could be exploring areas above as well as below this Lumiose City."
2024-02-27T20:57:03+0000,"The official LEGENDS: Z-A subforum has been opened.Please use it instead.Pokémon Legends: Z-A DiscussionDiscuss the coming game, Pokémon Legends Z-A hereforums.serebii.netAlso, this thread has been renamed into a General Discussion Thread."
2024-02-27T21:12:30+0000,"Because people would rather believe he was right than admit they've been fooled. It's what he's been doing for years.He is almost never correct; he merely bides his time until someone else has accurate information or an announcement is actually made. Then he pulls a Houdini to tie in his riddles with the announcement. People fall for it every time, and it's quite sad."
2024-02-27T21:14:47+0000,Charmeleon is always red as if the skin is abut to shed.
2024-02-28T00:33:46+0000,"The whole thread can be moved, but it'll be redundant.Pages can be merged with the Z-A Discussion/Speculation thread, but it'll mess up the posts.So, I'd rather not."
2024-02-28T02:01:57+0000,SpoilerThe Scarlet/Violet rotom phones remains untouched.
2024-02-28T02:39:04+0000,this continues to bother me as they are the best phone cases imo
2024-02-28T21:26:45+0000,I wouldn't be surprised if we got Charizard Z1 and Charizard Z2 lmao
2024-02-28T22:50:10+0000,The fact Charizard didn't have a new form in Gen IX was almost as shocking as the plot twist around the professors
2024-03-04T02:43:50+0000,"I lt was the first to get dedicated Tera Raids. That's Charizard's ""form"" for Scarlet & Violet."
2024-03-05T00:43:43+0000,It is also the first mighty raid to have its event repeated.
2024-03-06T14:36:12+0000,Can we take a moment to discuss how Scarlet & Violet does a terrible job showcasing the new pokemon?I keep forgetting most of them even exist. Ifound out Kilowattrel is the regional bird.
2024-03-06T14:57:08+0000,I would say both are the regional birds. Some regions have more than one but only one line is seen a bit more. Take Hoenn for example. Taillow is commonly said to be the regional bird due to how common it is in Hoenn but Wingull is also extremely common and used by just as many Trainers as Taillow.
2024-03-06T15:02:41+0000,"I think the issue is should the regional bird be Normal/Flying if it isn't 2 or 3 stage, or should it be some other */Flying.Wingull is equivalent to Wattrell, for example.That could be why GF made the Fletching line Normal/Flying even though it eventually becomes Fire/Flying, or with Corviknight's pre-evos being Flying before Flying/Steel."
2024-03-06T17:46:24+0000,"the problem is the open world systemits why the dex ordering is such a mess as wellbecause it takes into account several different places at one to categorize orderthe other issue is that Wattrel was placed along the coasts so its not actually available on route 1 really without the ability to swimthis would be solved with a more linear route system mapped out.Sqwakabilly is more like Spearow of the region or a stand out like Chatot is for gen 4, its not found until the 2nd gym"
2024-03-06T18:46:23+0000,"It would've been solved by simply having Wattrel show up on the Poco Path. lolAlso, I do agree that the dex ordering is trash. It should've been ordered according to province: South, East, West, then North."
2024-03-06T18:50:40+0000,"speaking of whichI remember the dex order bugging me so I remade the original gen 9 dex in a order I felt was more suitable, its not perfect but to me it works more.EDIT: I think what I'd fix is just putting the Grafaiai line between the Houndstone and Lokix line"
2023-07-19T23:23:56+0100,I was surprised by many things involving area zero such as Zada/Turo not being alive and the AI working on their behalf.
2023-07-19T23:25:10+0100,Until SV came out I didn’t know how much laggy and buggy a game can be after production
2023-07-19T23:39:58+0100,Yeah the twists with the professors were a genuine shock.  I'm happy I managed to avoid plot spoilers for those reveals.
2023-07-20T21:41:27+0100,"the ending for sure, even with rumourings of AI characters in the game, I thought if it was going to happen it was going to be Geeta.speaking of which, I am surprised at the team Geeta uses...."
2023-07-21T22:05:06+0100,"I was surprised that I actually enjoyed the battle system being closer to the previous mainline titles. After PLA I really was dreading going back to battling to capture without just chucking Pokeballs. Yet weirdly I really enjoyed it this time around, the interactive aspect of the game's battling encounters felt polished.I have also been pleasantly surprised by how lovely Paldea is to just travel around. Do I wish the graphics were better? Yes, but it still has a certain je ne sais quoi.I am surprised that I am very much looking forward to the DLC packs."
2023-07-21T22:11:14+0100,"Arven's backstory, most I've cried at a pokemon game plot in a minute."
2023-07-23T15:15:05+0100,"I was surprised to have actually like it as much as I did. I was expecting something I'd do because ""I'm too far gone into the franchise"" just like SwSh but I really end up enjoying it and still keep playing it."
2023-07-23T16:12:12+0100,"I was surprised at how much I liked Nemona’s storyline. I saw all of the jokes about how they interpreted her as a creepy stalker and thought she was going to be annoying at best, but as the story progressed I really started connecting with her because she came off as someone who hyper fixated on battling but constantly has to hold back because she’s too much of a people pleaser. This was the first time I really saw a character in Pokémon who really felt like me and she ended up becoming my favorite rival because of it.I was also surprised at how I ended up bonding with all of the teachers. I did the classes at first just because I was a completionist, but by the end they all felt like fleshed out characters that made the school portions of the game feel like an anime"
2023-07-23T21:38:27+0100,That the Pawmi line could actually swim and look adorable treading water. I thought it was one of the cutest things I’ve ever seen in a Pokémon game. I was also surprised how useful Naclstack and Gargnacl that have Sturdy and Salt Cure can massively help you during the story especially during Gym battles as Sturdy lets you be able to survive one massive hit to setup the Salt Cure effect which in turn can cause the target to lose a good amount of health in between turns. This is especially useful against Teratilized Pokémon.
2023-07-23T22:36:54+0100,"If we're talking major aspects then it's definitely the art style for me. I kind of like it but I was surprised by how realistic they decided to make the human characters look in-game when we got the first proper trailer. I feel like most aspects of SV feel like natural steps to build on SwSh and PLA though.If we're talking about minor stuff then I think the most surprising thing for me was the removal of Set battle mode. It doesn't matter much since you can emulate it by simply not switching after a knock-out, but it was one of those things I didn't expect ever to get removed."
2023-07-27T07:04:41+0100,The ending being the most depressing piece of media I've witnessed in a while.Also wasn't expecting a character who's on screen for like five minutes actually as themselves without pretending to be someone else or being essentially possessed to be my favorite character in the game by FAR.
2023-07-27T07:18:48+0100,The games touching up upon death was not something I ever expected from a Pokemon game because it's something they've mostly shied away from since generation 1 and Marowak. Hearing them say the professors passed away was genuinely surprising.Also most of Arven's storyline.
2023-08-04T21:48:03+0100,"It wasn't ineither, and I think no one batted an eye. I would like fishing to return though."
2023-08-05T01:20:38+0100,"The plot twist, of course.I never thought Pokémon would go that route."
2023-08-05T06:31:15+0100,"Yeah, it feels like the only other time Pokemon has usedcharacter deathas a plot device was in XY withFloette, only Floette got better"
2023-10-06T02:31:01+0100,"Almost a year later the game still runs awful and slow, the glitches, I love the game and story and if they fixed that it would be up there for me with B&W its just so much fun!"
2023-11-03T23:33:58+0000,One of the things that surprised me about Pokémon Violet is the way Miraidon completely replaced the bike.
2023-11-04T15:06:26+0000,"Yeah, after nearly 30 years Game Freak shouldn't be having these kinds of issues. But alas, they keep biting off more than they can chew.I really wish they would just pass on series development to Bandai Namco."
2023-11-04T15:19:01+0000,"Number of 6v6 battles:GeetaNemonaArvenClavellPennyAll the Teachers + Hassel in the Academy Star TournamentSada/TuroKieranOnly sad Carmine and Muramasa were not 6v6 from those which disappointed me.In SV we only had Hop, Leon, Mustard and Honey. Even Champion Peony was a 5v5 sa.e for Leon rematches."
2023-11-12T02:36:39+0000,"I was surprised to see how many pokemon that had fur or scales that we couldn't quite tell had them until now thanks to the more detailed models, like Gliscor having short fur on the back of its wing membranes."
2023-11-16T00:49:05+0000,I didn't realize until recently that the number of Pokemon who can learn Scald has been greatly reduced.
2023-11-16T09:38:50+0000,Another thing that honestly surprises me is reaching the peak of Glaseado Mountain and - from there - having the sight of the entire Paldea region.
2023-11-16T15:39:52+0000,That would NEVER happen. Pokemon has been one of Nintendo's biggest moneymaker franchises for decades. They're not letting the franchise go.Big twist in how the Gym Leaders levels are hidden. Obviously Brassius and Katy's are similar levels. But if you thought Kofu is next instead of Iono you are dead wrong. His level 29 water pokemonhit a lot hardercompared to Iono's level 23 paralyzing tactics.
2023-11-22T16:55:24+0000,"selling items in bulk and the fact that you can grab up to 10 eggs at once in picnics... and a bunch of other QOL featuresalso I was quite surprised when I jumped off a watchtower and there wasn't some kinda black transmission screen, I was so used to slow transmissions from gen 6-7, but now the game loads zones in real time and it's still wild to me"
2023-11-24T20:20:25+0000,"The games have already been out for quite a while so i think its safe to say it but the fact that the Professor Sada/Turo were dead the whole time and a robot with a ""malfunctioning"" program was in charge.Quite a shockerThis franchise only has a few other deaths (Floette isn't the only one)Latios (That blue psychic dragon gave his life to protect Alto Mare)Sir Aaron also known as Lucario's owner/masterCyrus is most likely deadLysandre in the games the weapon of mass destruction got buried i doubt anyone survivedThe old/sick Stoutland that Ash's Litten followedBut Turo/Sada really felt like something else since it is a real death that was confirmed and were likely were killed by the rogue versions of Koraidon/Miraidon"
2023-11-27T08:45:52+0000,"In what timeline is Cyrus ""most likely dead""? Even in the anime when they revisited the plot they heavily implied he was still alive.""Likely were killed by"" those pokemon? The AI explicitly tells you what happened."
2023-11-27T19:21:59+0000,Maybe Platinum? I mean the Reverse World didn’t really show any signs of plants and vegetables that were fit for human consumption and we don’t even know if the water found there was suitable for drinking. Giratina had adapted for living in this world but nothing else was ever found on our way to the Legendary Dragon. The other two games implied that Cyrus found a portal to a new and different world which is most likely some parallel universe with slight changes to our own world. The anime is pretty much the same thing. Cyrus technically succeeded in his plan and got to have a brand new world of his own even if the one he was currently in wasn’t destroyed like he had originally planned.
2023-11-28T01:20:30+0000,We also don't know that he's stuck there either. The player character and Cynthia just walk out. And the other two games imply that he just left and is still searching for a way to achieve his goal (or in BDSP where he works for Palmer at the Battle Tower).
2023-11-29T12:33:40+0000,"Is that being fair though? They're not a triple A studio and the majority of those years they have been developing games for subpar Nintendo handhelds. The Switch has probably been nothing but one giant learning experience for GF, heck you have had triple A studios put out games in far worse conditions than SV. TOTK is more expensive & suffers from performance issues and the map is mostly empty compared to SV where you literally have Pokemon scattered all over the place yet people have no issues blaming the hardware for that but when it comes to Pokemon it's GF being ""lazy"".People constantly say they aren't an indie studio but they are still a relatively small studio, a quick google search shows they have 169 employees vs like 400+ of InsomniacYes the game shouldn't have been put out in the state that it was, but they didn't publish the game so ultimately don't know how much say they had in delaying it"
2023-11-29T22:28:56+0000,"I'm well aware that they are an indie company, and that is my point. They are doing far more than they are capable for a franchise that demands more than they are capable. Not to mention Game Freak has been wanting to develop other IPs for years now.By passing development on to Bandai Namco, Pokémon gets the high-quality development it needs and Game Freak is no longer pressured under insane time constraints. It's a win-win."
2023-12-01T05:51:17+0000,Why Bandai Namco? Why not just hire more people for Game Freak/Pokemon company?Though oh god thank you for bringing up performance issues in TotK I've had them WAY more in that game than in SV (exception--the lake. The lake is slowdown central) and despite VIDEO EVIDENCE people still act like I'm lying.Anyway more on topic I was surprised how SMALL so many mons are! Gosh I'd be tripping over them every day if they were real.
2023-12-01T10:08:54+0000,I was surprised that there wasn't a more obvious Rooster of Barcelos Pokemon added. I suppose Skeledirge is suspected to be partially inspired by it (and Skeledirge is awesome) but I did think there was going to be a bigger role referencing that story.
2023-12-02T22:47:21+0000,I think Skeledirge is a more of a pinata version of the rooster. The only bird attribute is limited to his nose flame and the bird that appears when Skeledirge uses the Torch Song.
2023-12-02T23:09:21+0000,It's inspired by a few things probably. The cocollona and various other mythological creatures the rooster or barcelos being only a partial possible inspiration for the bird bit.  My point was more that I thought there would be more of a clear Rooster of Barcelos Pokemon.
2023-12-03T07:01:58+0000,What about Hawlucha or Ho-Oh for that role ? Both are colorful red birds.
2023-12-03T18:30:50+0000,Ho-oh is more various different phoenixs and isn't catchable in Scarlet or Violet yet and isn't native to Paldea. Hawlucha is more lucha libre and is based on hawks rather than roosters. Neither really fit and neither fit the mythology.
2023-12-17T19:39:48+0000,"One thing I came through in the Terarium that really surprised me was a blatant Lion King reference.If you run along the border between the Canyon and Savanna biomes, you'll see (on the Savanna side) a big rock that looks identical to the Pride Rock. At the end of it, there will be a male Pyroar looking at his kingdom.He will even completely ignore you, so you need to start a battle with it instead of it running at you like usual Pyroar."
2023-12-17T20:02:55+0000,So with the Indigo Disk I can now add the disturbing knowledge that the Magby line are covered in hair.
2023-12-17T21:34:28+0000,Same here. Can say that about a lot of mons actually.
2023-12-20T12:43:32+0000,"After the Indigo Disk DLC update, I'd say that flying all over the place aboard Miraidon is one of my new favorite things. In the previous post I was appreciating how cool it is to have a large view of the Padea region, by giving a look from the top of Glaseado Mountain... Well, now this feature makes the view even better."
2023-12-20T13:21:07+0000,"Yeah, flying is really nice. Also happy they put a nice surprise on top of the Terarium Core for those curious about flying up there."
2023-12-20T19:32:57+0000,"Not sure if this counts, but the fact that the Epilogue part of the dlc is coming out on my birthday is something that surprises me."
2023-12-27T13:38:31+0000,Auto Heal is the most underrated QoL improvement! It's one of those when you playing older games you don't realise how much you miss it! Hopefully they refine it next gen and allow it to heal status and reviveAlso outdoor Pokemon Centre similar scenario being so used to it don't realise how cumbersome it is in previous games to keep going back entering a building healing up
2023-12-28T18:37:39+0000,"Not much from a gameplay thing but something I just found out today...Grusha is... A dude. I dunno if it was just an impression or I misread something but I was completly sure he was a ladyDarn, after all those years of anime and always being quick to pick those things up, can't believe it'd come the day where I'd be fooled lol"
2024-01-06T22:35:48+0000,"I figured that the professors were sus pretty much the moment we got their names, considering their names meant Past and Future instead of some sort of tree like literally every other core series professor. What really surprised me was the twist that the professors were Life Model Decoys and the originals were killed a decade ago"
2024-01-29T14:16:18+0000,His design didn't fool me. We already had a female Ice Gym leader in Galar just a few year. But they are uncommon.Kanto: Lorelei (Elite 4 exclusive)Johto: PriceHoenn: Glacia (Elite 4 exclusive)Sinnoh: CandiceUnova: Brycen (Exclusive in Black 1/White 1He seems to prefer uses dark and steel in Pokestar Studios)Kalos: Wulfric (only other instance of same gender copying specialist in very next game)Alola: Only game that has no Ice Gym Leader and no Ice Totem either.Galar: Melony (Shield only)
2024-01-31T02:10:08+0000,Not nearly that long. They were probably alive when Arven tried to reach them in the incident that got Mabostiff injured. The implication is that they died either in the incident that the paradox dragon was fleeing from at the beginning of the game or soon before that (since it left a power imbalance between the dragons)
2024-02-19T23:32:29+0000,"I'm surprised at how great the selection of grass type Pokemon was in SV. The grass starter is good, there were a lot of good grass types available in Paldea, some more good ones added in the DLC (new and old). I never really cared for the grass type but I'm liking it this gen."
2024-03-18T23:41:28+0000,"To be honest, I am surprised just how big Paldea really is.I didn't notice it in my first playthrough, because I just went wherever the missions were. Now, in my second playthrough, I'm doing a lot more exploring, and I'm finally realizing that the region really is huge. This is particularly the case when you're exploring without all of Koraidon/Miraidon's riding abilities.There is truly a way to get to every town and every area in the game from the start, you just have to find them. I recently found this large winding path that takes you from Medali to the Glaseado Gym, and directly behind that gym is a cliff that drops you right into Montenevera. I didn't notice all of this in my first playthrough, because by the time I made it to Montenevera I had already unlocked the Glide and Climb features. Thus, I had no need to go around the mountains."
2024-03-19T11:28:09+0000,"I found that out rather quickly after exploring Glaseado. I had fought Grusha before Ryme and while I had previously gone to Montenevera to get to Glaseado, I accidentally found the slope leading back after I missed a jump with Miraidon and started to slide down the mountain."
2024-03-19T20:56:10+0000,The best place to explore is the Poco Path and surrounding area. There is so much we miss because we're busy doing what the tutorial tells us to do.
2023-06-01T09:45:59+0100,"Oh my god why do they make such a big deal about being able to pin the map to north but you still can't pin the MINI MAP to north? Come on, that's the one we're looking at all the time...Also the incredibly fast text speed the friend group has in the crater is just inexcusable. I read REALLY fast and it was still too fast for me. What in the world why can't it be timed like every other bit of dialogue in the game where it changes to the next line when we say it does?"
2023-06-02T13:44:22+0100,"Even worse is when a wild Pokémon engages a battle with you in mid conversation and it continues to be spoken and by the time you get out, the conversation is either near the end or has ended. I missed out on some really important info about Arven’s backstory about his relationship with his parent because of this and the conversation literally ended as soon as I escaped the battle. He was saying something about how the Professor would annoy him by doing something which I could get to see because the wild Pokémon battle animation began and the screen cut to a Raichu immediately with a message saying “Wild Raichu has appeared!”"
2023-06-03T21:11:39+0100,When you get into battle with an entire herd of some pokemon but end up having to battle all of them one by one. Even if you run another will attack straight away. While this did happen in legends arceus the fact that you could move in battle escape was much simpler.
2023-06-03T22:29:14+0100,"Oh god and they put such an emphasis on his story and put a lot of work into making it so good, but then people will miss so much. Even if you go out of your way to read the journals (which a lot of players don't for some reason), if you miss the super speedy dialogue you're still missing the full story. And it's such a good and impactful story! It's clear that they had a lot of real effort in making that story top notch! But rrrrgh!I wonder if the script writers were pissed at whoever decided to zoom though that text."
2023-06-03T23:38:49+0100,"Veluza.I like to pin the next raid location in the map so I can there while riding Koraidon but whenever I'm crossing the rivers this thing spawns, it ends up annoying me with forced encounters. Gets worse when the game gets slower duo the frame-rates issue.Now that's a species I won't mind seeing Dexit'd on gen 10."
2023-06-04T02:53:43+0100,I love Veluza but I think I only love them because I first came across one in a mountain pond and it was just the one of them. I didn't yet know the horror of the constant barrage of dimwitted psychic fish.
2023-06-04T04:20:10+0100,They’re so bad that I ignore any outbreaks that occur in water. Spend too much time running and fighting those instead of what I’m actually looking for.
2023-06-04T09:51:01+0100,No voice for characters  we need it really we have 2023Aggresive water pokemon all  they like shark in petroidVaporeon supremacy in mass outbreak really Nintedo did you  know Vaporeon is not ONLY ONE EeveeelutionOp Eevee Evolution  in raid they  make what  they want
2023-06-04T11:54:44+0100,I um...I don't think you guys understand what I was asking for. This isn't about small gripes or things the game is missing (and no we do not *need* voice acting--good god I do not trust this fanbase to not harass the actors either). I'm asking about actually annoying stuff.
2023-06-04T14:15:26+0100,"And yet, something being ""actually annoying"" is HIGHLY dependent upon each individuals own perception, and therefore highly variable... Because everyone is different, and level of annoyance of something is not a concrete or consistent thing (unlike, say, color or size), what could be just a ""small gripe"" for you could be ""actually/highly annoying"" for someone else and vice-versa, and because of this there is no fair or appropriate way to enforce which complaints are ""actually annoying"" and which are not.TLDR: You've created an opinion-based thread, not a fact-based one, and you cannot say/judge that one opinion is more right or wrong than others."
2023-06-05T08:09:43+0100,How many of these things though are things that SERIOUSLY annoyed you versus just being minor gripes?
2023-06-05T12:35:15+0100,"You still don't get it... You even gave a contradiction of your own above when you said you love Veluza after someone else posted about hating them, but here, let me give some examples of my own:You know how the mini-map is apparently a SERIOUS annoyance of yours, particularly how you're unable to pin it to north? Yeah, I could genuinely & honestly not care less about that as it doesn't bother me in the slightest and I'm just appreciative of having a mini-map.Also, you're probably aware of how some people get sooooooooooooo seriously bent out of shape over the forced Exp Share always being on? Guess what, I'm one of those who truly appreciates this feature because as a busy adult with a wife, a house, two dogs, a full time career, and eventually children, I don't have time to grind like I would in the old days. This feature also grants me the opportunity to easily try out new Pokémon even later on in my playthrough.And before you jump down my throat saying I must just love everything, there are still things that actually annoy me, such as raids of 5+ stars being (in my opinion) much more difficult to succeed in solo & without specific Pokémon / strategies. And yes, this does ""SERIOUSLY annoy"" me when I find a raid I really want, such as Walking Wake and/or Iron Leaves that took several days and some luck to finally capture.I can also agree with Janejane on the degree of annoyance for no interiors, and personally am still very irritated that there is STILL no permanent auto-sort for PC Boxes and/or Pokémon Home.Lastly, I find it incredibly annoying and slightly offensive just how much you use ""oh my god"" or ""oh god"" in your posts/comments... but as I'm trying to help you understand, that's clearly a phrase that doesn't bother you in the slightest because: everyone has different opinions, and every opinion is just as valid as any other."
2023-06-05T14:45:39+0100,"As someone has stated previously in this thread, this is an opinion based question. What is a minor gripe to you could be something incredibly annoying to someone else. There really is no right or wrong answer.For example, Veluza is one of the most annoying Pokémon in this game for me—way more annoying than Sharpedo was in the Isle of Armour. For you, you stated you like Veluza. Both answers are totally fine. Opinions are just that."
2023-06-05T18:32:55+0100,"Brrrrr, i haven't encountered a Veluza yet, but it still makes me get the chills aboutthose damned Sharpedo's in the Island of Armor oceans."
2023-06-05T18:57:21+0100,I don’t like that Pokémon cry out after they knock out an opponent especially in a Double Battle. It’s cool the few first times but get a bit annoying the more it happens
2023-06-05T19:58:08+0100,"You can turn it off. I did that with the menu buttons in Gen 9. Sheesh, so loud even on low volume"
2023-06-05T20:19:20+0100,You can? Guess you learn something new everyday. Thanks for letting me know I’ll have to change that next time I play because I will go crazy if I here Skeledirge’s cry again
2023-06-05T20:54:48+0100,"It's better than having to find the headset from a old man, in the third city if i remember correctly before Fire Gym in Gen 8"
2023-06-05T21:14:28+0100,That was such a needlessly obtuse way to access a key feature
2023-06-05T22:23:40+0100,you can speed up your swimming by pressing the left analogue. Koraidon swims a lot faster than Veluza if you do this.
2023-06-06T12:51:21+0100,Oh. So that’s why I don’t have trouble with Veluza unless I accidentally run into one because I couldn’t see it from a distance and I collide with it. I’m always holding down the left analog stick out of habit to traverse faster.
2023-06-06T13:38:37+0100,"Following Pokemon unable to keep up with you and therefore end up back in the ball.I appreciate the accuracy for certain Pokemon speeds, but even if walking there should like a set locator for them so they don't fall behind and keep a current pace.Also perhaps faster Pokemon should be set to follow beside you instead of behind."
2023-06-06T14:08:26+0100,i hate not being able to turn battle animations off
2023-06-06T15:45:48+0100,"I have a opposite, the lack of battle animations are not shown in raid battles and the terastallization animation not activating or is heavily delayed.Also if on my second playthrough i tried going after Kofu's gym instead of Iono as third but compared to her level 25 team...Kofu is actually level 35 and the wild pokemon outside his city are in the level 40 range and if you catch anyone it won't obey of course because of low levels.This is a opposite of a open game not adapting the gyms compared to your levels. Tulip is also this her pokemons are near level 50 while Larry's is barely in the level 40's if i remember correctly.I'd prefer if the games would try to adapt like Brock did in the anime where he actually asked Red how many badges he had beforehand as a reason for which pokemons he would use. Giovanni did the same in that anime, choosing which ones on his team were strongest."
2023-06-06T15:54:34+0100,Miraidon and Koraidon can also jump but are they faster than the Rotom-Bike?
2023-06-06T18:55:51+0100,This brings up another point for me. The speed can be an issue even more this gen when walking with a Pokemon as its now part of an evolution method. It can make those Pokemon a much longer process to evolve (e.g Pawmo to Pawmot)
2023-06-06T18:58:04+0100,"I’d say about the same. They can definitely outrun faster Pokémon wandering around but without any Sharpedo automatically targeting you and it being nearly impossible to outrun them in SV, there is no way to be sure."
2023-06-06T19:20:49+0100,"I hate checking a Pokemon's habitat in the Pokedex, unlike previous generations it shows where the Pokemon lives on the map, but not where YOU are currently on the map. You also can't zoom in on the map to get a better look at the area of habitation. You also don't have stamps to mark things on the map. Yeah, you can mark a destination, but only one at a time. What if you want to mark multiple locations to get all of your Gimighoul chests in one go?"
2023-06-06T19:24:06+0100,What I do is mainly fly to every watchtower and see if there is a Gimmighoul there. Paldea’s Highest Peak has one on top of the sign daily so that’s also a must go to location for Coins.
2023-06-06T20:53:15+0100,Gimighoul is definitely a one of the worst challenges. I bought the game on launch day and i only have335coins. *screams*Does Gholdengo register into the pokedex if you get one in a trade?
2023-06-06T21:57:15+0100,Yes. I got a hacked one through surprise trade. I traded it to my other profile for the dex entry then released it
2023-06-07T00:11:58+0100,"Thanks, that's REALLY helpful. I might do it for the annoying ones that only evolve while traversing maps in the online mode.I already finished Pawmot, but i don't know about Brambleghast."
2023-06-07T15:11:59+0100,"Yeah, at least with Sharpedo, you could see it coming from relatively far which gives plenty of time to dodge or at least plan for it.Sometimes Veluza even cross the start of the border in the land areaTrue but thing is: sometimes I like crossing the routes on normal speed, mostly to hoard for items. And with the ocean routes, it's easy to miss if you go too fast."
2023-06-07T15:45:48+0100,I think finding the Stakes to unlock the Ruins of Legend rather annoying. I am missing one to get Chien-Pao (which is one of the two that I actually want to use) and for the life of me I can’t figure where it is! I am using an onl8ne guide that is rather accurate with a map with the markings where the Stakes are hidden and how to reach them but I spent two hours going in literal circles and looking exactly where the guide says to look and I still can’t find the last Stake. I want to get it so that I can move on to getting the other two.
2023-06-09T18:38:06+0100,Paradox Pokémon are the most annoying thing the franchise has ever created. It’s more annoying than the funny Tera hats.I also hate that they take unique dex number. Those dex slot could have gone to a real new Pokémon and we could have gotten a much better Paldea dex. Choices.
2023-06-11T18:45:30+0100,"They’re no different than the ultra beasts ultimately. A group of stronger than normal Pokemon. No different to the convergent Pokemon we’ve seen in Paldea.Given Paldea has one of the larger exes amongst the last few gens, this is a nonsense complaint.If you want an “all only new Pokemon Pokedex” you’ll be left waiting because I think every game since Alola has made it clear that Game Freak want to reinvent some of the older Pokemon each generation. That’s a given now."
2023-06-11T19:46:04+0100,Well at least the case of ultra beasts they are actually new designs and not just reimagined or reskinned versions of older pokemon.What I’m complaining about is paradoxes taking up unique dex numbers instead of just being considered as forms similar to Regional Variants.
2023-06-11T22:33:00+0100,"Toedscool/Toedscruel and Wiglett/Wugtrio take up dex entries and are basically the same thing. If you're okay with these four Pokémon, you can't complain about the Paradox Pokémon. Different categories but amounting to the same thing."
2023-06-11T23:18:41+0100,"Diglett is based on a mole. Wigglet is based on garden eel. Tentacruel is based on jellifish. Toedscruel is based on mushrooms.Meanwhile, Delibird and Iron Bundle are both based on a penguin.There’s a difference there."
2023-06-11T23:37:39+0100,"You cannot be serious.Wigglet is based on Diglet. Wugtrio is based on Dugtrio. Same for Toedscruel/Tentacruel/Toedscool/Tentacool. They're new interpretations of the original Pokémon.Iron Bundle is based on Delibird in the exact same way.It's the same thing, categorised differently for the purpose of the Pokédex and storyline.Cannot believe you are arguing there is a difference between them, frankly."
2023-06-12T10:17:12+0100,Pokémon being too small for me to see them in the wild.Being forced to use those awful preppy kids uniforms.New shinies being barely any different.New evolutions being barely any different.Characters describing ugly places as beautiful.The complete lack of level scaling for gyms.Having to use EV reducing berries once again aswell as having limited options to raise EVs.Each of the three routes repeating essentially the same cutscene for most of the game with only a few little changes.Battles taking too long to start.All TMs being breakable and the whole crafting system in general.
2023-06-12T11:33:57+0100,Honestly I am generally fine the crafting aspect but I don’t like how hard it is to get some of the materials necessary for some of the better TMs. They should have stuck with non breakable TMs being found in various locations and have us craft TRs which do break but are some of the more commonly used moves such as Brick Break or Substitute.
2023-06-12T11:48:59+0100,"If they weren’t given their own dex numbers, Paldea’s dex would simply end on 1000+ instead of 1015+It’s not like we would get 15 new Pokémon if the Paradox were treated as forms without their own dex numbers."
2023-06-12T13:37:48+0100,"I thinkTM's should always be unbreakableIn this game the pokemon you are looking for aren't guaranteed to spawn and it can depend on time of day.On my newest gripe i hate that you could get more clothes than uniform styles, helmets, gloves, hair, backpacks, shoes and version exclusive uniform colors and.(annoying for those not wanting to buy dlc)Sword & Shield had aamazingvariety of clothes. Brilliant Diamond gave us themed clothes sets and a Platinum retro outfit. Legends: Arceus also had a lot of different outfits including a lot of and garchomp theme kimono and many color choices for all of the clothes.Lets Go was more limited but your partners can get outfits (i didn't use them)"
2023-06-12T16:01:03+0100,The TM machine is a massive downgrade tbh. The unbreakable TMs made putting together squads and useable 'mons so much easier.I reckon using materials to manufactureitems would have been a good thing - it was done in Sw/Sh using the Cramorant machine albeit with a lot of randomness - but the crafting for materials feels like a step too far.And to be frank - why can't we craft for elixirs/potions/etc? That would have been more useful by far.
2023-06-12T16:08:55+0100,"Good grief... you are BOTH equally correct in what these new Pokémon are inspired by. Copley Hill Gym gave the Pokémon-based inspirations, while 1991 gave the real-world inspirations. Neither of you are more wrong or right than the other."
2023-06-12T17:34:45+0100,"Yeah, no.I’m not arguing that they’re not “inspired by eels” etc. I am pointing out that the Paradox Pokemon and Convergent Pokemon amount to the same thing.I am also saying that arguing for one group to not have Pokédex entries based on an entirely arbitrary and subjective definition is ridiculous.Either way, Paradox Pokemon and Convergent Pokemon both have Pokédex entries and that won’t change, that’s an end of it."
2023-06-12T21:48:41+0100,The fact that there is no icon on the map detailing the shops or places of interest (e.g the specific types of shops) within the urban settlements other than the Pokemon centres. It's something you can cope without of course but it would be useful when you are first getting used to the map to have an icon so you can find the specific shop you are looking for without having to check online or wander around until you find it.
2023-06-12T21:49:59+0100,How quickly shinies can despawn in multiplayer. Failed a Tatsugiri because of that.
2023-06-12T22:38:28+0100,"- I try to adjust the camera to make pokemon battles look like in previous entries (the trainer behind the pokemon), but it always cut my character and depending on the size of the pokemon I’m using, it cuts them as well.- Not being able to enter buildings in a open world game lol"
2023-06-12T23:12:52+0100,"Actually, there's an option to zoom the map (ZR/ZL button, I believe) that allows to pick a few key places on cities. Mostly shops and restaurants"
2023-06-12T23:25:46+0100,That does seem to be the case. Probably could be a bit more visible without having to zoom the map but ultimately at least its something.
2023-06-12T23:36:02+0100,"Veluza being Sharpedo 2.0, it can make exploring areas where they appear a bit annoying. Same goes for Tauros since they tend to spawn in herds.Don’t mind the crafting TM thing too much though Spiritomb not being a potential raid spawn can make crafting TMs requiring its material a hassle (you are limited to a few fixed spawns per day)."
2023-06-12T23:39:41+0100,It seems like every generation they want to change how we obtain TM’s. Totally annoying and unnecessary. Unlimited TM’s is the way to go.
2023-06-13T00:52:23+0100,"I definitely enjoyed the SwSh approach to TMs above all other games. 100 unbreakable TMs with relatively weak moves that help progress through the game and then 100 breakable—yet easy to obtain—TRs that contained most of the strong and desirable moves. I wish this was the SV approach; or, at least, make some of the materials easier to obtain."
2023-06-13T00:54:06+0100,"I preferred the gen 5-7 approach. All TMs should be reusable. If they're going to make TMs single use again, why not bring back HMs too and make us carry a Bibarel around everywhere just for traversal?"
2023-06-13T01:33:53+0100,"Found Tauros's to be a bit more of a pain tbh. And rather funny. Kept on running into me, so I try to give them a huge berth."
2023-06-13T12:24:20+0100,!? Just go to watchtowers and maybe grind some. I bought the game on June 1st and I think I have more than u
2023-06-13T12:31:29+0100,"I’ve been able to outrun most Veluza that I see while exploring and if I am attacked by one targeting me, it’s because it sneaked up behind me. I could never outrun Sharpedo. Tauros I don’t mind that they appear in herds as it makes sense given cattle tend to be seen in groups and are social animals. What I don’t like is how hard it is to find a Blaze or Aqua Breed in the herd. I’ve literally never found one in the Wild and only have them via trading."
2023-06-14T03:04:10+0100,"I wish there were better options for EV training in the early game. The power items are expensive, and you may need multiple of one type of band in order to train a team of six. Vitamins are even more expensive and are locked behind gym badges.. For all the crap that gen 6 gets you will never convince me that Super Training wasn't the best thing since sliced bread!"
2023-06-14T06:17:18+0100,at least these aren't locked behind Battle tower points.
2023-06-14T09:51:46+0100,Having zero post game . Didn’t even have a battle facility
2023-06-14T15:00:18+0100,"I think we'll get a battle facility, it's just gonna cost us thirty dollars extra :/"
2023-06-14T15:01:57+0100,It will be the first time that I won’t get the new dlc. Not going to play these laggy and buggy unfinished games
2023-06-14T15:23:28+0100,I don’t know where you’re getting that they are still lagging. They put out an update to the game so it loads less into the frames. Obviously sitting in a hoard of Veluza or dropping into the bamboo forest might slow down the game. But overall the game performs ok. I’m not going to rave about its performance but it really isn’t terrible.Bugs? It has more than its fair share of bugs. Most have been addressed. But there are still a few things they need to fix here.Unfinished? Yes. Entirely. The video game industry has evolved in such a way that games are sent out 80% complete and then the remaining 20% is released through DLC. That’s how it is now.
2023-06-14T22:15:29+0100,"The mention on HM slaves on last page made me realize the -raidon is pretty much a glorified HM Slave. They rock climb, swim and even headbutt trees!"
2023-06-15T10:45:56+0100,It's always easier for some members of the Pokémon community to remain defiantly negative.
2023-06-15T11:10:34+0100,"The game lags. That is not a matter of being too negative, it's merely a fact, proved by countless testers who showed it's unable to keep a stable 30fps, certainly not just in a few areas, even after the update, (which had some areas performing worse).Whether you overlook that lag because you like the game, it's up to you, but let's not spread misinformation and try to gaslight the others by acting like the update fixed it for the most part when it really didn't lmao"
2023-06-15T11:15:12+0100,Don’t call my Koraidon a slave. I have severe emotional attachment to it and you will be severely emotionally damaged
2023-06-15T13:20:43+0100,"Hey, I love Koraidon too. I was just pointing out that in a way, the legendary also fills the role of HM slave."
2023-06-15T14:01:29+0100,I forgot about that feature! I always did enjoy watching the Pokémon hit the punching bag so hard that it flies off screen. I think this was the only way I’ve ever done any EV training outside of feeding Vitamins to Tyrogue in hopes of getting all three Hitmon’s.
2023-06-15T14:28:17+0100,"I actually am with you, let's not spread misinformation. Totally agree.But let's also not pretend it's so buggy and laggy that it's unplayable. We've seen many of those negative voices (one in particular on this forum) basically complain at every opportunity and downrate the game to an unplayable mess - when we know it isn't."
2023-06-15T17:01:48+0100,"The more ambitious the games are, the more glitches will be and a lot of those people point about SV are stuff you expect in any 3D open world (although when it comes to low frame rate, SV definitely goes beyond what should be allowed).What I think has become obvious, however, is that the yearly release schedule of Pokémon games don’t allow for games as ambitious as SV.You either make a properly finished open world or you release one game every year. You can’t do both, games of this scale take time.I wonder, though, if the people who complain endlessly about how unfinished these games are would accept waiting 3~5 years for a new game? Because I seem to remember the same people throwing almost daily tantrums because they had to wait 2 months for news in 2022."
2023-06-15T21:26:30+0100,"So much this!In any event, I have played far worse games. Just replayed the first two gens of Pokemon. You want a buggy mess - !!!Yet, of course, I love Red and Silver. Excellent games."
2023-06-15T21:27:19+0100,Not to mention you power them up with Herba Mystica which literally has HM as its initials which is likely a reference too. I think its a fun one off idea to have legends join us early. I wouldn't do that every game but I think it works here.
2023-06-15T22:10:40+0100,Gen II wasn’t so bad with the glitches if you never used the Time Capsule. That is where a majority of th3 problems came from.
2023-06-16T00:02:03+0100,Breeding being locked into picnic is annoying. You can’t do anything while waiting for eggs.
2023-06-16T02:02:13+0100,"I just kick around the ball with Miraidon, Ditto & whatever Pokémon I’m trying to get eggs of."
2023-06-16T02:35:06+0100,I generally run around the picnic or I sit my Switch down for a bit.
2023-06-16T14:06:33+0100,the fact that most plot-relevant characters got hair streaks but YOU CAN'T also annoys me without end. here's hoping for Arven's hair in the DLC
2023-06-16T15:29:19+0100,"I think SV had the best use of the legendary, not going to lie. He finally feels an actual character and he joining the player feel satisfying."
2023-06-17T07:28:25+0100,"When I run away from a battle and then immediately, the Pokemon attacks me again and I'm in the battle screen once more. That is annoying."
2023-06-17T21:12:02+0100,The fact you cannot buy Ice stones from a shop but you can buy some other evolutionary stones from shops. Its not completely the worst thing in the world but it is mildly annoying that they can't be as easily obtained as other stones like the fire stone can be.
2023-06-18T01:56:46+0100,I also think that is odd. It’s not like the Ice Stone wasn’t easily bought in a Mart before as LGPE had them for sale and the Pokémon who can evolve with it aren’t exactly hard to find nor is the list as limited as the Dawn Stone. I mean the Thunder Stone went through four generations where only two Pokémon could use it and even then it could be bought.
2023-06-19T02:14:56+0100,You can take me off of Miraidon for everything else but picnics are where you draw the line? Okay Game Freak
2023-06-19T19:25:00+0100,"Ever since the DLC additions were added, I've been unable to do a union circle meet up with my Scarlet & Violet games. I used to do it no problem for stuff like raid battles & mass outbreaks, but now I can't have both games playing at the same time even though they're on separate devices."
2023-06-19T20:20:15+0100,Do you have physical or digital copies of the games?
2023-06-19T20:48:19+0100,Scarlet’s digital & Violet’s physical. It seems to be working now because when I tried to load Violet it said “downloadable content not working”
2023-06-19T21:08:59+0100,Can’t guarantee it’ll work but I have both as a digital game and I uninstalled both games when I had the same issue as you. Once I downloaded the games back after “deleting” them the problem was solved. Let me know if they worked. I’ll be happy to help you out.
2023-07-09T00:49:07+0100,"I’d say some of the evolution requirements, the fact that I have to take 1000 steps with a Pokémon with the let’s go feature that is busted half the time is very frustrating"
2023-07-09T04:50:14+0100,"Uhh you can walk up and down the academy stairs 10 times and it takes ~20 min to do, in which you can watch Netflix"
2023-07-09T04:52:36+0100,"Yes but that was just one example, it also doesn’t change the fact that it’s still annoying and frustrating at times"
2023-07-09T07:23:40+0100,I ran around Levincia City three times and got it to happen in ten minutes.
2023-07-09T17:15:24+0100,"I didn't try anything besides keep playing with Pawmo as the leading mon. Took a while but I eventually managed it.Hope process will be easier if it makes the cut on Gen 10 (and I do hope it does, as I've been wanting an eletric/fighting mon for ages)PoGo will make it another case of ""walk with your buddy to evolve"" (how I hate those)"
2023-07-09T19:42:42+0100,"Not being able to jump. It's pain in the butt to retrieve items in places where Miraidon/Koraidon can't reach, because I can't jump or roll to get to it."
2023-07-09T20:59:15+0100,Yea like coins that are in small areas. Hate those.
2023-07-09T21:36:51+0100,Yep money gouging with unfinished games being bait on fishing rodsBreakable TM/TR's are SO ANNOYING.I miss the days when the Alola games were the last to still have unbreakable TM's.The problem with items in any game starting from Legends Arceus/Gen 9 materials you can't always guarantee the right pokemon you need will spawn and the Gen 9 games won't let you track more than 5 TM'sBDSP has a limited ammount of TM's especially SURF (Not counting from the ones you can buy in the Veilstone Department Store) and theHikers aren't easy to find or the items they want for them
2023-07-09T23:13:00+0100,"Oh, even worse, I found the TM Fly atop this steep mountain in Glaseado, and the peak was so narrow Miraidon couldn't fit. So I had spent half an hour trying to maneuver my way to the tippy tip of that damn mountain peak."
2023-07-10T02:33:00+0100,Word. Hated that one. Koraidon couldn't fit either. So it was a fiasco. Same with the coins at the top of the mountains.
2023-07-10T02:34:36+0100,Where was the TM tho? I had 0 trouble getting my Koraidon fitting on Paldea's Highest Peak and that gimmighoul spot near the Leaking Tower
2023-07-10T20:47:51+0100,"Never ran into issues with getting places with Koraidon tooBut then, I'm not that active on farming the Gimmighoul coins..."

Just because the Paradox Cyclizar double as transport does not make them less legendary.
2023-07-10T22:21:15+0100,"Oh no, this was at the top of one of those thin snow pillars on the lower end of Glaseado. It was SO difficult to climb."
2023-07-10T23:34:55+0100,"Now do one with their personalities, development and characterizationAlso Mewtwo, the OG legendary, was just a lab rat. And will be forever more iconic and popular (not to mention a far superior design) than any of those legendaries that need some life/death/time/space godly attribute added to help make them remarkable. So not really a good parameter."
2023-07-11T01:37:16+0100,Ohh can you give me a vague description of the place? Imma go check it out
2023-07-11T02:11:27+0100,"Bro is so f**king Kalos biased. The Paldean Legendaries (Korai/Miraidon) are literally the sons of Terapagos and Dialga, and the only reason you can catch multiple are because in-universe, they are the copies (imagine mitosis) of the true Legendary. Why can't Pokemon make positive changes about the Legendary and the player creating a legend of their own? And don't call them bicycles. Go look into their damn origin before spitting out these blatant complaints like your home bug, Spewpa. Go devote yourself to Kaleido Star if you think the only good in Pokemon is Kalos, or whatever early gens you like"
2023-07-11T02:13:09+0100,"The overabundance of encounter power electric among the restaurant meals, which further pronounces the encounter powers that don't show up at all in those establishments.Like, this isif you're an electric Pokemon enjoyer, a bit less so if you just want to grab a quick bite and not go through the hassle of whipping the table out to cram a sandwich down your face."
2023-07-11T02:15:56+0100,"Yea and the meals are overpriced and filled with random crap, but then a 500-Pokedollar Sandwich gives you Lv.3 buffs (Herba Mystica are basically free at this point)"
2023-07-11T05:56:24+0100,"Here, I actually posted the video on my Twitter.https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1678629088356106240"
2023-07-11T14:22:06+0100,The SV Box Legendaries aren’t related to Dialga at all. Cyclizar is where they came from and Koraidon and Miraidon are just evolved versions of Cyclizar. I like to think of this as a Carbink transforming into a Diancie situation where there is a physical change in a relatively common Pokémon into another distinct Pokémon but it’s not an official evolution as not all Cyclizar will undergo the transformation. Koraidon I know is said to be the “prehistoric” version of Cyclizar but it’s really more like a prehistoric evolution if anything.
2023-07-11T16:35:18+0100,One thing was never established. Did Koraidon only exist during ancient times and is during the Ancient/Future times but are now trapped protectors in a Paradox situation ?If they have any connection at all to Cyclizar at alli'd say it is a forced evolution created by Arceusas if he has determined that something from the dlc stories are a impending threat to Paldea.
2023-07-11T21:14:39+0100,I’m thinking of something similar as it is very evident that people in Paldea Ride Cyclizar for transportation and even have safety gear for riding the Pokémon yet Miraidon/Koraidon just happened to evolve from a Cyclizar without any explanation and it isn’t an official evolution as the cause or reason why it had occurred is ever mentioned. My guess is it has something to do with the time machine and Paradox Pokémon and there are two of the Box Legendaries because the process happened only twice when no one was looking. We know Diancie is created when a Carbink stores enough special energy to cause it to mutate. Cosmoem evolves into either Solgaleo or Lunala depending on how much sunlight or moonlight it stores in its body. Koraidon and Miraidon seem to be recently discovered Pokémon as there are no mentions of them prior to ten years before the games began.
2023-07-11T23:26:53+0100,One slight issue is with that while they are recently brought to the present these Koraidon/Miraidon are the ones on the cover of the Scarlet Book/Violet book and  were seemingly named as the Winged King/Iron Serpent . This book is apparently around 200 years old (not sure on the exact year) and while they still may have been created recently I think it's explanation I think will be slightly more complicated and tie into that expedition. To me this isn't isn't really annoying unless they left it unexplained and given that Arven points it out I think we will get an explanation in the DLC as it seems like a deliberate mystery.
2023-07-11T23:47:30+0100,Still Koraidon at least seems primal in design. Perhaps Koraidon was brought back was a from a Winged King fossil guardian that went extinct ?Miraidon is probably way more advanced revival of a similar fossil but technology was used to create it.But what caused it to be sent to the present is a mystery?
2023-07-12T00:37:07+0100,What caused them to be in the present is due to the time machine Sada/Turo invented at least according to the AI (and is backed up by Turo/Sada's journals). According to them they believe that Koraidon/Miraidon was brought from another period in time (Past/Future). The AI is fairly upfront with us on how they think the machine that they helped build works.I have my own speculation how i think it works but until the DLC is out its hard to be certain based purely on the information currently in the game and without leaning into rumours which is a whole other topic.
2023-07-12T01:32:06+0100,"You don't need to get off your ride to get that one.   The collision detection in this game is pretty forgiving, as long as you're reasonably close to it you can pick it up."
2023-07-12T01:53:26+0100,"Lmao they’re not actually the sons of Dialga, it’s that they aren’t bicycles and actually affect time so yeah, connection to Dialga because he controls time so the -raidons essentially are closer to Dialga than other ‘mons."
2023-07-12T02:40:18+0100,"As someone who has used Eelektross in a playthrough, they definitely had it float too close to the ground. Sometimes it goes through the ground, especially when it uses a move like Flash Cannon. It's face goes directly into the ground while performing that move."
2023-07-12T03:08:10+0100,"I tried it. For half an hour. Didn't work. lolI mean, if it worked for you, congrats! But it ain't work for me."
2023-07-12T12:07:08+0100,Not being able to rematch the Elite FourNo battle towerBreakable TM’s once again
2023-07-12T12:13:50+0100,The TMs breaking I don’t mind since we can craft our own at any time as long as we have the recipe and materials required. I don’t like Thunder Wave or Confuse Ray and having the option to just ignore them is nice and I do like creating the TMs for Moonblast and Drain Punch multiple times. You fight a lot of Pokémon while exploring anyway so TMs being useable only once isn’t too bad.
2023-07-12T14:25:38+0100,"I always thought TM should be one-use only until you beat the game, to avoid cheapening the game by loading your Pokémon with an overpowered set.But once you beat the game, they should become infinite-use. There’s no reason to keep it one-time only once the game is over."
2023-07-12T15:37:31+0100,"Or maybe they could have de AI be more intelligent, have better attacks and stats, plus higher levels. Even with giving the player access to better attacks they could still be a challenge."
2023-07-12T21:44:16+0100,"This isn't purely a Scarlet/Violet specific thing but, I wish the judge function was available from the start of the game. I don't  really see a reason why you can't know the strength of your pokemon from the get-go. It would give players more options when training their pokemon if they knew their stats"
2023-07-13T02:21:26+0100,They should also implement the difficulty option from BW2 and have it be available from the start.
2023-07-13T17:48:56+0100,"This is a nitpick, but the Pokemon league rooms in Unova and Kalos are so beautiful while in Scarlet and Violet it’s just a plain room. No epicness or charm whatsoever. Maybe that was the idea since it represents school."
2023-07-13T23:04:36+0100,"I know this has been covered before and there’s been a Mod come in, but…“They are bicycles”No, they’re. Subtle difference. If you play the game and get into it, you feel fond of your steed. Maybe this resonated with me more, being a horse rider in my spare time, but Koraidon in particular felt like a steed. They basically made an Epona for Pokemon and that was no bad thing. The Titan storyline involving the Herba Mystica (HMs, ha ha) gave some more depth of story and feeling to the game and the new legendaries."
2023-07-13T23:26:04+0100,Koraidon became my favorite legendary. Hands down.He might not be the coolest-looking ever but the story made his bond with the MC truly remarkable.
2023-07-18T20:10:50+0100,"battle form Koraidon is one of the coolest critters they've come up with in my opinion.something that annoys me is that your dorm room remains bare even after all your adventures. I expected at least to get our picture with Penny, Nemona, Arven and Koraidon put in the frame"
2023-07-18T20:39:32+0100,"Or better yet, all of the selfies that were taken after defeating each Gym, Titan, and Team Star Boss. They put so much effort and detail in them to be wasted on something that can only be seen once."
2023-07-23T01:12:54+0100,I am not a Fan of ScVi semi-realistic Artstyle.They should have stayed 3D Anime/Cel Shade.
2023-07-23T01:27:15+0100,Be nice if we could customize our dorm room like a secret base.
2023-07-24T02:19:06+0100,"-This will probably be a null complaint when it eventually releases but I'm kind of annoyed on how the DLC is seemingly focusing on new characters and not your buddies in the base game, I'd particularly want Arven to be relevant since it's about Area Zero and I want more info on Geeta, the opposite professor, and Heath (which we'll probably get)I'm at least hoping they implement gym leaders in the DLC areas like how they did for SwSh-The amount of two stage families when some of them look like mid stages (I like Scovillain but I think it looks like a mid stage evo, and we need a yellow pepper)-No Starmie"
2023-07-24T03:21:46+0100,"Perhaps they feel that their character arcs are done after all the area zero, team star, gym challenge stuff, but maybe they’ll get a cameo in the DLC. Now that I think about it, Sword/Shield DLC mostly focused on new characters, aside from Oleana having a cameo in the Crown Tundra and the Gym Leaders appearing all over Isle of Armor."
2023-07-24T04:09:07+0100,"That's true but IoA and CT were disconnected from the main story, Hidden Treasures of Area Zero is connected to the main story of SV"
2023-07-24T19:19:50+0100,The lack of a blank plate. It just seems weird to have all regular plates other than that one. I know some people say its not needed as Arceus doesn't need it as its already normal type but I think there would be some use.
2023-07-24T19:45:46+0100,Given that all of the other plates increase the strength of moves of their type there is an argument for the inclusion of that plate. It does overlap with the Silk Scarf but the other plates overlap with the other type items.
2023-07-24T19:50:53+0100,I sort of find it annoying that I keep finding the TM for Thunder Wave on the ground. I despise that attack and won’t teach it to any of my Pokémon and if any of the know it due to learning the move as one of their first four slots then I try to get rid of it as soon as I possibly can. Same with Confuse Ray although I might keep it if the user can learn an attack that gets additional effects from the target having a status condition and because of possible damage in between turns.
2023-07-24T20:02:38+0100,I’m curious. Why do you hate Thunder Wave? I tend to use that sort of attack to catch pokemon.
2023-07-24T20:18:31+0100,"Every time I use it, the paralysis never makes the target unable to move. I’ve lost so many Gym battles because of that. Yet whenever the AI uses it on my Pokémon, they can never move and lose the entire match. I lost to Lance in Crystal once because he swept my entire team with his first Dragonite because of Thunder Wave and I had a full team at max health all unable to move because of paralysis. I only took out Gyarados and then became unable to even inflict 1 HP of damage because of stupid Thunder Wave."
2023-07-25T04:45:24+0100,"Yes i so hate confuse ray, no matter who uses them. But Fantina, Crasher's Wake's Floatzel, Crasher Wake's Gyarados's Water Pulse, Hoenn E4 Phoebe and Unova E4 Shauntal are the worst."
2023-07-27T17:07:51+0100,"One thing that really irritates me is how Maschiff's dex entry literally mentions its thick fat, but it does not have the ability Thick Fat."
2023-08-08T22:57:56+0100,"They removed basic content (ex: battle facility) and story elements (ex: any remote lore explaining what makes the box arts legendary) of the game that every previous major mainline series game had as a default. Basic staples of the game every previous entry either had right from the get go or with like 1 free update, just to repackage it as $35 DLC. People are having to pay $95 to get the same levels of content previous entries had for $40."
2023-08-09T02:04:35+0100,"Battle facility was basic content? In what game? It's always postgame. Even in HGSS where you can access it early they won't let you compete.And they explained the box art legendaries. In all the years of pulling creatures through time, only two of these ever came through, indicating they're at the very least extremely rare in the future. And heck, being ""really really rare"" was good enough for the legendary birds of Kanto, yeah?"
2023-08-09T02:27:22+0100,"Postgame that I didn’t have to pay extra for. It was already in the base game, you just had to unlock it of course."
2023-08-13T05:51:42+0100,"Having certain Pokemon be limited events... ie: Iron Leaves, Walking Wake.It sucks for anyone who prefers to take their time and not rush in a game or for those who rent games."
2023-08-13T07:48:27+0100,"But Iron Leaves and Walking Wake didn't drop until three full months after Scarlet/Violet debuted, and they've been repeated periodically since, have they not? What's the threshold at which ""anyone who prefers to take their time and not rush"" has been deemed to have had enough time to prepare?And Pokémon is simply not a game that can be effectively played if someone only rents it periodically, how are they to somehow factor that in as well?"
2023-08-13T08:08:53+0100,"I don't think Walking Wake and Iron Leaves are going to be only tied to that one event, anyway.Especially since Raging Bolt and Iron Crown are found in the DLC.They were also found to have deleted Pokedex entries in the datamine, and many Pokemon in that list have been confirmed for DLC."
2023-08-13T13:34:06+0100,I hope so. Because trying to get them via Home is impossible.
2023-08-13T19:07:23+0100,"When the raids were first announced they stated that they would appear again so the train has definitely not passed (""). But I agree that there is a good chance that they will appear in the DLC as non-raid encounters as well."
2023-09-25T01:26:40+0100,When I first visited the paldea league I didn’t felt inspired to battle with this government looking office.
2023-10-04T09:38:21+0100,"I am pleased that the very first item in this thread, not being able to pin the mini-map to north, was remedied with the DLC. Now I can navigate like a true free adventurer, always knowing where I'm going."
2023-10-04T20:09:28+0100,"That really struck me as unfinished. I think they planned to have voice acting for that part; it would have worked so well. Seems like they blew the budget on Ed Sheeran though.I am just now getting serious about EV/IVs. It was a let down to find almost all of my mons are all rated just ""OK"". I was pretty excited to see some rated as amazing and great, so I'm going to start EV training them. But yeah, I wish I had had the benefit of getting good ratings early.I'm hoping this is an ""asset library"" problem. Each successive generation built on the previous generation's assets, so they could copy assets and make new variations. For the Switch, the workload exploded.  The modeling has to be more detailed, so you get all sorts of new tasks - maybe trying to salvage old models, but also ""high-resing"" textures; increased algorithmic complexity (anchor points for tera crowns, move animations for each mon). And all of it has to be done while contemporaneously upgrading the game engine. I can imagine that not all tricks that work to make things look nice in 2D/2.5D/isometric are going to work for 3D. These last few generations on the Switch remind me of how gen 1 in that it's rough outlines of a much richer and enjoyable game. They probably do need to slow the release cycle though.As for me, this isn't theannoying, but it was kind of a let down... in postpostgamewhen you go back to the depths of Area Zero and see *aidon, you can't interact with it. I think that would've been fun - to rebattle or have some kind of interaction with them.Also wish it was possible to do multiple map markings like what can be done in PLA. Especially right now, since I'm not ready for five+ star raids, being able to mark it as such on the map would be nice."
2023-10-04T23:45:24+0100,"Not sure whether not having the judge function until the post-game is out of fear people will adopt a Paul-like mindset when viewing their Pokemon (as numbers rather than pals). Bottle Caps do exist but Hyper Training only really becomes an option in the late or post-game (they are quite pricy, even with the required level dropped to 50 that is pretty much late-game levels)."
2023-10-05T00:37:49+0100,"yeah, it seems to me most games avoid giving you the option to micromanage too much stuff until late game or even New Game+Micromanaging is something that usually ruins the immersion, so I guess developers want to avoid people treating every step they take on the game as a chore that must be optimized - then blaming the game for not being fun."
2023-10-05T06:58:18+0100,"As far as voice acting, why would they only have it in one single part?As far as the spoiler there...Spoilerwhat do you mean can't interact with it? If you mean the second paradox dragon, the ""Guardian of Paradise"", yes you can. You engage with it and can catch it. I have a video where I do it if you need proofI engage it at about the 28 minute mark"
2023-10-06T02:22:15+0100,The freaking angles while battling It ruins the immersion why cant it be set like LGPE or even SS.
2023-10-06T04:33:56+0100,"A lot of games will do a mixture of both - some scenes with voice acting and some scenes without. My no-evidence-whatsoever speculation is that they didn't have enough time to rework the dialog before release. It would have been cool to have voice dialog with the Arven, Nemona, and Penny through out the game.I found out about theGuard of Paradisea few minutes ago and knew there would be a reply waiting for me about it. I guess I didn't engage with it by pressing A."
2023-10-08T19:03:05+0100,the fact that you can enter a wild battle literally directly after having just finished one makes me syo mad when im trying to avoid them
2024-01-03T05:15:16+0000,The annoying thing at least for me is the lack of store interiors and always having to squeeze by pokemon encounters of pokemon spawn anywhere near where you battle.I missed where the stores have a kind of personality to them instead of just a simple menu. Yeah we have the interiors of certain sandwich stores but yeah...
2024-03-12T19:58:16+0000,"Getting the EXP Charm in the Teal Mask as early as you do, and being unable to switch off its effects. Once I have it, my team levels up way too fast and ends up trampling all over the major battles in mid-to-late game, and everything becomes a bit too easy until you start the Indigo Disk."
2024-03-12T22:18:25+0000,"A barren open world with nothing but pokemon to fight, no interesting sights or secret areas to find.  It's not even just the lack of side quests, it's the lack of people existing in Paldea. Everyone that isn't a trainer is holed up in the cities and towns. No team star goons to bump into, no traveling merchants, nothing. Trainer NPCs have set locations and are sprinkled around the areas but there's also only a dozen or so (if not less) of them per area. So you end up with like 90% of every area just having nothing to it, no incentive for players to stick around and try to find cool hidden things, you can just move straight to your next destination and that's it. It also doesn't help that a lot of the environment can feel similar, and even the names of the areas are bland/uninspired with the ""Area One (South Province)""."
2024-03-13T12:16:43+0000,"And u cant even enter buildings when you are in the ""cities"".......I didnt touch this game for a year and its going to stay like that."
2024-03-15T16:09:59+0000,"I feel the same way, got discouraged to keep playing after defeating the league and I’m not buying those DLC’s either."
2024-03-16T10:18:49+0000,"Same... why would I buy a DLC when the base game is full of low frame rates, lags and bugs"
2024-03-17T19:42:03+0000,"Raid bosses that literally no-sell your efforts even when you have the right counter and they take minuscule damage on from your super effective damage,when it is a lowly 5 star or 6. (I can understand the occasional need for it on 7 star events though)I absolutely hate when i forget what weakness a Tera type is. I has can attest to often using a wrong pokemon since i was sure it would work.But when the game decides that""only fighting is effective on Ground type on a Garchomp""when Grass/Water/Ice would work but the boss shrugs it off.Fighting is not a common used counter on Ground in the base game."
2024-04-20T09:38:53+0100,The new characters in the DLC are all annoying especially that emo kid.
2024-04-20T10:25:24+0100,Amarys I thought was pretty cool on a few different levels.
2024-04-20T11:51:22+0100,"The fact that sometimes (but not always) connecting to the internet resets all the raid dens.There have been so many times where I've come to a raid, thought, ""That would be a good Pokémon to have, but I'll probably need help from actual people to beat it,"" only for the raid to disappear when I switch to online mode."
2024-04-20T11:59:17+0100,Yea that's annoying. What's the point of it  if you're not able to get help online with it?
2024-04-21T06:44:32+0100,"Most likely if you still have data for a raid event that has officially ended, the forced raid den reset once you go online is to remove all the event dens from your map (along with the data for said dens). Not sure whether that is also the case for outbreak events."
2024-04-21T22:16:14+0100,I only dislike Kieran. Sure he is a growing kid or teenager. But his attitude doesn't seem like a good a personality to respect Ogerpon or Terapagos or a Elite 4 Champion.His sister is Carmine is a lot more mature despite being wary of outsiders and hiding it behind her anger.Ogerpon had a tragic and terrifying backstory and Terapagos showed it could be destructive in it's final Stellarized form.
2024-05-18T18:08:53+0100,"I think its just the Pokemon Centers for me.Being outdoor gas stations although thematic, are not practical for being a resting spot for trainers and a mini-hub to rest and shop at.I am hoping next gen does allow more interior buildings."
2024-06-16T00:42:15+0100,"1. Veluza. It's one of the most annoying Pokemon I've ever come across since they ambush you easily and they're hard to avoid in watery areas late in the games. I thought the Sharpedo in the Isle of Armor were annoying, but Veluza is so much worse lol.2. The lack of building interiors. It began to bug me after a while because it makes exploring cities and towns so boring. Most towns are just a Pokemon Center (or two) and a ton of food shops now. Even interacting with NPCs is basically pointless in these games since very few of them give you items. :[3. The fact that some Eeveelutions like Vaporeon are so common while a few others like Sylveon or Umbreon are much rarer. Vaporeon is basically found inlake late in the games.4. The way some Pokemon spawn right behind you. I cannot even count how many times I stood idle for a few seconds completely sure that no Pokemon were in my vicinity, only to have one pop up and ambush me when I least expect it.5. The size of the region kinda grinds my gears. It's huge but there's nothing really that interesting to explore. It would've been nice if there were an occasional plot relevant building here and there to visit outside of cities and towns, but all you get is grassy areas, trees, rivers and lakes and an occasional ruin. Oh and a boring ocean that only has like 7 evolutionary lines of Pokemon in it. It gets boring after a while when the vast majority of the map is so bleak.6. Not the most annoying aspect, but the treasures of ruin Legendaries are frustrating to unlock. I've seen people compare them to the Regis, but I still think translating braille is easier and more fun than having to find 32 stakes."
2024-06-27T00:17:46+0100,"I thought about this, and I wish more of the Pokemon programmed in the game were obtainable.I halfway don't care if it's via a tera event, but like, where's my Enamorus?"
2024-07-14T04:38:19+0100,"When I accidentally run into a pokemon and it makes me battle them then leave the battle instead of backing up away from them like when you’re flying and accidentally collide into oneWe can only go inside a few housesThey don’t tell you how to hatch eggs specifically, I still don’t understand it and I miss the daycareIt loads when you want to fly out of the main city and it doesn’t do that with anything elseWhen I was playing the dlcs there was a lot of things I had to look up or find out myself because they didn’t tell you what to do after something happenedNo one in the game told me about paradox pokemon, I just found out about them a couple days agoWe can’t exit the “continue” part of tera raids if you accidentally click it or you decide you don’t want to do it anymore and you have to wait for it to finish loading"
2024-07-14T12:36:32+0100,"To get eggs, you need to:1. start a picnic with just the two Pokemon you want to breed2. make a sandwich with Egg Power. The best ones from my experience are  the Ultra Peanut Butter (which needs butter, jam, banana and peanut butter), Ultra Marmalade (cheese, butter, marmalade and cream cheese) and Ultra Pickle (pickle, basil, olive oil and watercress).3. Once your Pokemon have eaten the sandwich, the Egg Power effect lasts for 30 minutes, Stay in the picnic for a while and keep checking the basket at the picnic table. It may take time for an egg to appear, but it eventually will. You may get a few eggs if you check the basket enough times.Also, when it comes to unlocking new sandwich recipes, each time you earn a Gym Badge, you need to go into one of the ""Every Wich Way"" sandwich shops in any town, speak to the fat guy standing by the counter saying ""New Sandwiches"", and he'll give you the recipes."
2024-07-16T12:17:13+0100,"Thank you so much, this helped me a lot, I appreciate it"
2024-07-23T03:23:51+0100,"I don't like how breeding works in these games. I hate basically being forced to use egg powers since eggs are really hard to obtain otherwise. It's just a time consuming system compared to the old way of breeding.Also I hate Drayton's trial. You don't get told that you'll need to raise Pokemon caught in the Terarium until you talk to Drayton at his battle location, so you have to go out and train a decent team to defeat the trial trainers before battling him which is a hassle even with Chansey running around. If they'd at least foreshadowed this when you first get to the Terarium it wouldn't be a problem, but they just spring it on you after you've probably spent hours hanging out there."
2024-07-24T15:58:50+0100,Agreed That rule came out of nowhere but i used rare candies from online raids to ease the pain. I can understand how the game doesn't want players to steamroll over Drayton with imported/caught before The Indigo Disk came out. At least the pokemon near Drayton aren't too ridiculously low leveled XDFinding the Rockruff with the Hidden Ability to get the Dusk Form Lycanroc in Gen 9. The game literally hates players hoping to find it and i had to import one from my Gen 8 save file (I have two in Gen 9 now) I'm glad to have one since i love that design
2024-07-24T16:16:46+0100,"Yep, you can't even get a photo album for potential moments when you defeated a titan pokemon/star boss/gym leaders Thosezoom past you really fast and its hard to time it with the switch screenshot button."
2024-07-29T04:21:59+0100,That's why you have to read the books in the library and the notes in the labs.
2024-07-31T04:25:55+0100,i honestly randomly stumbled upon a dusk form lycanroc in north province area one first time i entered it
2024-07-31T12:14:45+0100,"The shiny locks on the Snackworth Legendaries. Aside from getting both of the scrolls for evolving Kubfu (rather than limited to one tower per profile in SwSh) and an easier mean to get extra Glastier and Spectrier, there isn’t much motivation to go out seeking all of them."
2024-07-31T13:46:07+0100,How did that even happen ? Finding this pokemon directly in the wild is like a 1% chance spawn but it is still practically unheard of.Not even Gen 8 Raids or Dynamax Adventures or any online Scarlet & Violet battles have ever had a Dusk form as a boss.
2024-07-31T14:44:56+0100,"funny you mention that  tooi encountered a dragon tera type dusk mane lycancroc as well offlinealthough I have never seen a Palafin, Family of 3 Maushold or a shiny tera raid."
2024-07-31T15:27:13+0100,It’s not entirely crazy. The first Sinistea I encountered in SwSh ended up being the antique form. Sometimes luck finds us at the right (wrong?) times.
2024-07-31T17:34:14+0100,I never bothered about the tea bottles. A pokemon is just a pokemon. Probably rarest thing i found on a recent console would be the shiny Shinx i found in the first realm you unlock. This was on the hills close to where Alpha Snorlax. It was less than 4 days after i bought it (in real time)
2024-08-02T06:09:28+0100,There's a kleavor in the terrarium but we can't evolve scyther into kleavor? Okay
2024-08-02T19:49:06+0100,I guess Black Augurite is extremely rare or hard to find in Scarlet and Violet? That’s the only logical answer I have.
2024-08-02T20:16:35+0100,"That would be fair to say, but the area where Kleavor spawns in the Terarium is covered in spiky black rocks that are very clearly supposed to be Black Augurite. They definitely should've made it available, it would've been fine as either a Pokedex reward or something you can buy from the School Store, like Archaludon's Metal Alloy."
2024-08-14T18:58:19+0100,"Sadly it won't happen. Players will have to breed themselves in scyther from another game and train it stats before sending it into Hisui to get specific stats on Kleavor if you want to train it from low levels. I haven't tested if the fixed spots Kleavor in paldea always has the same natures or stats spread, he's not on my watch list."
2024-08-14T23:45:19+0100,"I did something similar to this. When PLA came out I went and caught a Scyther in the Gen III Kanto Safari Zone and proceeded to get as many ribbons from there all the way to Gen VIII and made sure to get the SwSh and BDSP ribbons before transferring into PLA and evolving it.I did expect the Augurite to be available in SV but it seems like that was missed. So except for the solitary spawn in the DLC, Kleavor is locked into transfer only territory. Aside from Wyrdeer I had expected all of the Hisui cross-gen evolutions to be obtainable in game. So that also makes Ursaluna-H available by transfer only as well. Annoying for players, indeed."
2024-08-15T00:10:36+0100,"If I have to say it, it’s the exclusion of potential egg moves most Pokemon could learn."
2024-08-17T00:01:04+0100,"I'm stuck on a Tera Raid battle against a Copperajah whose tera type happens to be fighting. It's a 5-star battle, and the moves I have seen it use include Heavy Slam, Curse, Iron Defense, and Sandstorm. And yet, no matter how many times I try to go up against it, it keeps winning with all the help I get. It doesn't help that everyone who joins me always seems to use a FAIRY-TYPE!!! It's like these people ignore type advantages and just go for flashy moves and not think smartly! But this isn't the only time something like this has happened. Every time I try to get help from others to win a five to six-star rated tera raid battle, people always use pokemon with a type DISadvantage against the pokemon I'm up against! What is wrong with people!?"
2024-09-03T19:02:24+0100,"~Not necessarily the fault of the developers, but I'm so tired of getting into Raids where people just want to show off random shinies who are not strong and are not of proper typing to take on the raid. I think some of these are those advertisements (bots?) but I swear it's not just them. This is really annoying.~The character customization. I liked that we get to customize the face, but then all of the rest of it is so lacking in comparison to recent generations (X/Y, S/M and Sw/Sh). On top of that, I just feel like everyone looks the same. Even for us girls, we all look the same as the boys, because everyone has the same body types and there are no actual long hairstyles. GF really dropped the ball here.~Slow interface and animations. Why is it that stat changes are still a thing that we have to have to pause and watch a full animation and text box for? Why can't they just be a little ping on the side of the screen instead? This is particularly annoying in Raids, which are already so slow with all of the other strange stuff that happen in them. This isn't 1996 anymore, GameFreak.~Unobtainable Pokemon. It is a thing in all modern Pokemon games now and I will complain about it with each one (aside from Legends: Arceus, which has actual reasoning for it)."
2024-09-08T18:14:23+0100,They should add a way to kick people out of the pre raid menu because sometimes they spend all their time scrolling through their boxes just to leave.
2024-09-15T18:30:53+0100,"When the high level Tera raid bosses too often get scripted effect that resets your hard earned boosts during the fight.Tera Raid Bosses that aren't taking damage from obvious weakness, like tera dark taking way too low damage from a fighting type pokemon.Instead you need odd strategies that you would probably never guess; like using a Bug Tera Mew with bug moves against 7 Star event Mewtwo and even then it is a 80% chance that you would lose andweren't allowed to catch him(if i remember correctly)"
2023-01-17T11:06:55-0500,"Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet have been released on the Nintendo Switch for two months as of tomorrow, January 18th, and now that the new generation has had some time to settle, I figured it would be a fun way to start posting in OI again than to talk about something everyone on the Internet loves to hate: other people’s opinions. Had I thought of this thread idea back in 2020, I would have considered posting a similar thread for Pokémon Sword & Shield also, but I guess it just didn’t come to me until now.In any case, the premise of this thread should be pretty simple. With every new generation comes popular opinions about them, and with popular opinions being a thing, the opposite is bound to be true as well. Ideally, this can be a space where we can discuss the latter, whether those opinions be positive or negative feedback. It’s good to be back, and happy posting!I’ll start with an opinion of my own, just to get some form of discussion going. I genuinely think Tinkaton might be one of the most overrated Pokémon we’ve had in quite some time. For a Pokémon with one of the best type combinations, its battle performances honestly isn’t that great, and its “Corviknight lore”, so to speak”, feels like little more than a reason for Game Freak to give it an incredibly lazy Shiny form, since it’s only actually the hammer that changes."
2023-01-17T14:26:30-0500,"Nemona kind of sucks as a rival, and I was surprised to see so much praise for her. She’s just sooo generic. For most of the game all she really does is talk about battling and/or Geeta. The likes of Hop at least had his relationship with Leon and eventual switch to research.I think the way they handled the open world kind of hurt her. She never really interacts with anyone bar the player and Geeta until the end of the game, and by then it’s mostly just background stuff in Area Zero."
2023-01-17T15:21:05-0500,"Oh I like these type of thread! I can state things I consider true without being massively flamed! Anyway:-I actually rly like dudunsparce. Sure, kinda anticlimactic all things considered. But it managed to preserve all the things that I liked about dunsparce, while also granting them better stats (and stab boomburst!). Also, and this isn't an opinion it's just a fact, dudunsparce has much more changes than just one or two more body segments.They also gain an extra pupil, one more chin spike and a weird thing at the tip of the tail!I also like other unpopular mons like grafaiai, scovillain and spidops, tho those don't get nearly as much detractors as the earth snake.-This may sound weird, but I.... actually wasn't as bothered by the bugs as other people. I mean, they were certainly there and were kinda hard to ignore. But....Idk really. Maybe my childhood of watching movies on damaged cds made me overtly tolerant to sudden frame drops and stuff like that. Oh well. All in all, I'm happy that my brain wasn't bothered by that, it certainly helped me enjoy the game itself more."
2023-01-17T15:46:30-0500,"The group dynamic between Arven, Penny, and Nemona is, I feel, somewhat overrated. I’ve seen a few posts around the web saying they’re “what Hop, Bede, and Marniehave been,” but like… in the grand scheme of Scarlet & Violet, your three rivals barely even interact with each other outside of the final mission. I think people are mistaking them being strong individual characters that end up paired together as them having a strong group dynamic. But really, Penny and Nemona hardly even have a reason to be involved in the final storyline. I’m not going to fault Hop, Bede, and Marnie for never being shoehorned into a scene with one another just to exchange some snarky remarks about each other.Actually, expanding on that, I feel like the writing for The Way Home is maybe some of the weakest in the game. At least up until the very end. The stuff with the AI professor and their relationship to Arven, that’s all good. But when you’re adventuring through Area Zero, why do Arven and Nemona’s IQs take a plunge? How did Arven manage to confuse “research stations” for “radish rations”? Why is Nemona like 10x ditzier than she ever was during the rest of the game? Penny at least gets to be sarcastic about the whole affair, but that running commentary is all she contributes besides turning on a lightswitch (we really needed a STEM track hacker genius to handle that).I don’t really follow your logic here. Tinkaton’s hammer isn’t made of Corviknight metal, it’s made of metal from stuff like Pawniard and Bisharp (see Tinkatuff’s Scarlet Pokédex entry). And in any case, Shiny Tinkaton’s hammer is bronze, which doesn’t correspond to the Shiny colorations of Pawniard, Bisharp,Corviknight, so I doubt they had any kind of “lore” in mind when determining that."
2023-01-17T15:58:41-0500,"I liked their dynamic and I thought Nemona was still in line with the rest of her characterization but I agree Penny's contribution to The Way Home is so weird, just being turning on the lights.. The entire reason she's brought on at all is because of the worries about the security systems, but every single security system is handled by the AI even the more dangerous or beat up ones.Wonder if there was some rewrites there at some point."
2023-01-17T16:11:38-0500,"Well to be fair, it still is ""logic"" in the sense it's not that they would know beforehand that the AI would handle it, so her presence there was a necessity"
2023-01-17T16:20:28-0500,"I'm not a fan of open world Pokemon done this way. It worked for Legends: Arceus and I liked SwSh's Wild Area and DLC places, but there's something about SV I don't like. It's just so uninteresting! Too few landmarks for a map too big and it feels like it's flat or mountainous with little in between. The main exception is the field between the Grass and Electric Gyms, but there's nothing there. Going from Mesagoza, you either go west to a different colored flat area or east to a different color mountainous area that I have to admit is more interesting but is annoying to navigate as the north east mountain areas. There are some really nice areas like the cliff bridge leading to the Psychic Gym, the Forest where the Poison Team Star Base is, and even the area with all the lakes before Mesagoza, but I just don't like most of SV's open world. Maybe there's some other stuff I can't put my finger on too. I'm pretty sure the next thing I want to complain about is a major thing too.Not sure how unpopular this is, but Shiny Pokemon areWAYto common in SV and makes even looking around at whenever Pokemon spawn when I'm running around for Terastal Dens almost feel like Shiny Hunting. They were already too common is Legends: Arceus, but SV makes it even worse by letting Pokemon despawn so easily to let new ones spawn. They should've changed the odds back to 1 in 8192 for wild Pokemon, or this may be a veryunpopular opinion, but maybe even decreased the odds to 1 in 16384!I don't see how Shiny's Tinkaton's Bronze is anything like Shiny Corviknight's color but I completely see not liking Tinkaton's Shiny for just changing what it's holding. It's still better than Shinies you can't tell like Paladian Tauros. (Why did they think a Black Shiny for a Black Pokemon was a good idea in a game with overworld Shinies!?) At least it looks better than Komala.This is probably because you can't make changes to make lots of people happy withoug making some others unhappy and I'm in the minority, but I think I liked SwSh better... Not being able to hunt for a Ditto for breeding as easily as even Pre-DLC SwSh and not having a Battle Facility would probably be enough to make me feel that way because there's no postgame without a Switch Online Subscription, but even other in game things too like Trainers being so ignorable instead of obstacles..."
2023-01-17T16:28:38-0500,"I don't think the past paradox mons as a group look any better than the future ones. It feels like they only remembered to have a consistent design aspect in the dinosaur tail for some of them, and it looks pretty stupid on some of those."
2023-01-17T16:52:50-0500,"Tinkaton's shiny form does actually change something about the body, but it's very subtle.  All three mons in that family have metal bits sticking out of their torso that changes color to match the color of the hammer (though oddly their eyes remain the same color despite being the same color as the metal in the regular form).It's most noticeable with Tinkatink, since its metal bit covers most of its torso."
2023-01-17T17:05:06-0500,"I had nausea - the type of nausea I get watching my siblings play Bioshock and me and my family play Katamari games - watching my nephew go through Pokemon Sword's Wild Area the first time, and all I can think about with the open-world direction Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are taking is that Game Freak is losing a not-inconsiderable portion of their audience with nausea-inducing open-world gameplay. I now have to watch my nephew playing the latest Pokemon games from behind the sofa, not sitting on it like he wants me to be. I probably can't play open-world games for more than 20 minutes at a time without nausea unless I use handheld mode on the Switch or only play games behind the sofa (and probably getting drinks or bathroom breaks every 15 minutes or so).~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Regardless of how close its design (and the Naclstack line's, especially Naclstack) is to copyright infringement, I actually think Gholdengo's design is kinda cute.The post-release marketing for Natdex #999-#1000 is getting a little too on the nose, though. I get how Gimmighoul takes most of a playthrough to evolve, but do the official Pokemon websites and videos have to emphasize the line and their positioning at the 1-grand markmuch? The official website's SV Trainer's Guide mentioning this line abnormally often compared to other lines with weird evolutions is pushing me over the edge, and this line is already probably my favourite lore-wise in all of Gen 9.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Say what you want about all the future Paradoxes' names beginning with ""Iron"" and all of those Paradoxes looking like robotic versions of their counterparts - their official art all having cool white dot effects on body parts is anice touch.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I do not get how Maschiff evolves facially into Mabosstiff. At all. The other 2 dog lines make sense; this one does not. It's like they switched dog breeds in the middle for the ""please stay mastiffs"" line.I do like how it's implied that Mabosstiff has given up completely when it comes to making children treat it seriously, though.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Compared to the worrying levels of flamboyance in descriptions of Lechonk2's and the PinkHammer lines in pre-release leaks, I like and appreciate how restrained Oinkologne and the Tinkaton lines' designs turned out to be. Tinkaton isa loli - she's a teenager at oldest, and she has a square-toothed dwarf/troll face to boot.Roaring Moon, on the other hand, deserves all the roaring praise it got on its initial leak through gameplay. Really cool design and MegaMence shout-out. Game Freak did not hold back there, and I appreciate that, too.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This might be my habit of tracking Magic: the Gathering set previews leaking in (and most of the average MTG set consisting of bad cards - by design), but I prefer judging generations by peak design instead of average design. And as floozy as several lines of birds and uncreative as 3 lines of 2-stage dogs are (we'll ignore the 3 lines of 2-stage insects/arachnids because those arthropodsthat diverse IRL), and as obviously derivative as every single Paradox(-category Pokemon) is, Gen 9 has some of the zaniest Pokemon designs in years. Honestly, I think they're at least as zany as Gen 7, if not more. And that zany creativity is really nice to see."
2023-01-17T17:13:44-0500,"Scarlet and Violet's open world isn't actually a good open world.For one, it only gives you the illusion of choice. Yeah, after the two hour tutorial, you can do whatever you want, but people tend to overlook there are like 17 tiny asterisks next to it. You're still going to be forced into progressing in a specific way because if you don't, you can't swim or climb or glide, and catching Pokemon soon becomes a pain in the ass. But even the former can mostly be circumvented in clever ways. The latter is all messed up because catch rates and obedience are tied exclusively to the gym badges where instead they should have been tied tooverall progression.There's no sense of danger, and barely any sense of discovery. The most memorable open worlds are ones where the world itself feels dangerous and where through multiple playthroughs, you'll still discover something you haven't in the previous ones. What's the point of high level areas where you can simply walk past them like any other area? And all you're really doing in the overworld is scavenging items and collecting Pokemon. where's the sidequests?And then the three arcs don't even tie into the overworld all that much. Team Star feels like the most neglected and wasted potential. You have this whole group that's supposed to interrupt the whole quest in the first place, but then they pretty much stay in their corner. Plus all they unlock is just some TMs in which you can get most of them through the overworld in the first place. Team Star should have done what Team Yell was doing in Sword and Shield and hinder your progress until you beat the snot out of them. It would have made them feel moreThe Pokemon League, a concept that's been around since the very beginning is downsized in its importance so it wouldn't outstage the finale. I wouldn't be surprised if Game Freak outright removed the League and didn't replace it with an equivalent in Gen 10 because they seem to be doing this often. Just look what happened to having all the Pokemon playable in one game, and the Battle Tower.Arven's quest does manage to tie into the overworld because his arc doesn't even end at the completion of the quest.And then the actual layout in itself. It's just geometrical shapes slapped onto each other that make traveling it pretty cumbersome. There are actual 90-degree turns and stuff within the map.In many ways, Scarlet and Violet is like the Sonic Frontiers of Pokemon games. They both made a change to the formula after a controversial previous entry. Both stories are held in a positive light because of the previous entry's story and characterization. They both have some great highs, (maybe even some of the best in the series), but also some egregiously disgusting lows that neither IP should be making when considering how old each franchise is."
2023-01-17T17:28:10-0500,"This game overall feels more like an elaborate tech demo or proof-of-concept than an actual, complete experience. Complaining about TPC’s crunch culture and lack of polish is nothing new or unpopular, but frankly I think this game is little more than an unpolished template and feels horribly incomplete as an actual 60-dollar AAA game.Do I want Pokémon games in the future to expand upon and improve from this template? Yes, 100% I do. But I don’t think these games will stand the test of time at all - which is a shame, because with just a bit more time to marinate (say, a 2023 release to better Soave it out from PLA), it could have been something truly special. I’m glad that people found the game fun, and I do to an extent, but my frustration with it feeling blatantly incomplete outweighs that."
2023-01-17T19:42:20-0500,"I like the new egg system of idle -> hatching. I know some folks are frustrated with the fact you can’t hatch and get eggs at the same time, which is fair, but I still like the idle for eggs bit a lot. I feel like I’m wasting way less time going for shiny Pokémon when I’m working on something else with Pokémon going in the BG.Jubilife Village should have been in SV and the big school should have been in PLA. What I mean by that is that the game with segmented levels should have had a nice cool central hub I can explore in between visits to places while SV should have had a mostly tame little town you don’t feel bad about not visiting a lot. I’ve still spent basically no time in the school; I don’t actually remember its name. I want to drive around the open world, not sit in some laggy city."
2023-01-17T20:43:39-0500,"Starfall Street is the best of the three storylines, or at least a strong contender. The gameplay is bad, except the sheer hype of the squad boss fights, but that's not what I'm here to defend.Most criticisms I've seen of the story boil it down to just ""bullying bad,"" but there's a lot more to it than that. In fact, I don't think it says much at all about how/why bullying is bad; it kind of just reasonably assumes that we'll accept that and focuses on other themes. The word ""bullying"" is said often, but there isn't a lot more in there about bullying itself.Meanwhile, Starfall Street gives you:Various kinds of loveable misfits, perhaps relatable to anyone who struggled/struggles at all to fit in as a kid (I doubt I was half as ""weird"" as Atticus and I find him kind of relatable anyway).Those misfits rallying together in the face of adversity and supporting each other in a really wholesome and endearing way.A group that seems abrasive at face value, but then flips that perception on its head pretty much as soon as you beat any boss.At the same time, a group that stood up for a righteous cause but ended up taking things too far and needed to be confronted about the path it was on.And my favourite of all: An authority figure who goes out of his way to understand the abrasive-seeming outcast group, and ends up properly apologizing for the ways his institution failed them. It's kind of weird how Clavell, an extremely important character in this story, seems to seldom even be mentioned by its haters. Also, Pokemon is partly a children's game, the SV stories all deal heavily in children's story themes, and I think the example of a respectful authority figure that Clavell sets is excellent for the kids.Throw in an okay gag with the Clive stuff, a reasonably fun character in Penny, and an identity twist that's obvious to adults but might plausibly fool some kids, and you've got a solid story here.It's fine not to like Starfall Street - this post is just sharing my opinion - but this is one of those moments where a lot of the vocal critics don't seem to have even understood it."
2023-01-18T13:28:49-0500,Team Star is a bunch of weirdos that deserved to get picked on.
2023-01-19T18:34:09-0500,"By the end of the game, Nemona had cemented herself as my most disliked major character in franchise history. I skipped gens 6 through 8, so I'm sure that I've missed some other clunkers, but out of the games that I've played I can't remember a single other character who left a strong enough negative impression to actually bother me. This is partly because of how she's written, but also part of my biggest problem with the adventure as a whole: this game doesn't have a real antagonist. Not until the final boss anyway, which is mostly out of left field and not really built up to.I don't care for the Team Star plot and think that it's pretty lame on the whole, but I'll at least score that one as a matter of taste and preference. There's at least a novelty to a non-villainous villainous group, so I can live with it even if I don't really like it. But even taking that into account, Team Star suffers further from the way the open world is set up: the three major questlines are treated as entirely separate things, and not one of them ever really has any bearing on either of the others. In past games, you'd have the villainous team get in your way in some manner or another as part of your main quest, diverting your attention and establishing them as a threat that needs to be defeated. That can't really happen here with how S/V is set up. You can (and I did) ignore Team Star entirely until the other two quests are completed. So not only are the stakes lower than they've ever been in the series for a villainous team, the way that they're implemented here ensures that they have the least possible impact on the world around them. They hardly matter.Arven's plotline ended up being my favorite of the three, but even then, I expected more out of it than what I got. Like at first I thought, okay, this guy is using me for his own ends and is probably going to double-cross me at some point for one reason or another. Or barring that, his plan of reviving Mabosstiff is going to backfire on him and I'll end up having to battle Mabosstiff as the final Titan or something. Neither happened; there wasn't any twist at all. And you know what? I'm okay with that too. On some level it's actually refreshing to have a somewhat competent supporting character whoneed me to completely bail them out in the end. Way to pull your weight, Arven.And that leaves Nemona, the so-called ""champion"" who--despite being a super-competitive battle genius--never actually tries to defeat you and never once even expresses any disappointment for losing. That's an awful spot to be in for a ""rival"" character. I don't need every rival to be a GB-era jerk, but I expect them to at least. Nemona doesn't. All she's good for is some of the most patronizing interactions I've ever seen in a video game, in the same encounter going back and forth between ""taking it easy on you with a weak team because you're a greenhorn"" and ""showering praise and astonishment on you for being a genius who knows how to... utilize type advantages."" It's borderline insulting.With BDSP fairly fresh in my mind, I think back to Barry for contrast. He wasn't a scumbag out to make your life miserable like Blue was. But he very much felt like he had his own goals to achieve for himself and was--quite literally--one step ahead of you throughout the adventure. He plainly demonstrated as much through his actions. Until he loses to Team Galactic ~75% the way into the story, that is, and you switch places with him from that point onward, being one step ahead of him for the rest of the way instead. That's a really basic but nevertheless effective way of conveying progress for the player character.S/V doesn't have anything like that. It doesn't feel like there's a single major character in the quest who is serving as a barrier for you to overcome. It feels like the player character is never really given an opportunity to grow. It's kind of a problem for all three questlines, but it feels most pronounced for Nemona because, out of any of them, you'd expect the rival to carry the load of being the designated obstacle.I've said this elsewhere and got ""lol way to overthink a kid's game lol"" in response, and okay, sure. But every single Pokemon game is built for barely-literate children, and every other one that I played managed to have at least one antagonist."
2023-01-19T23:41:44-0500,"Look, I love Nemona, but I will say this:There is NOTHING wrong with wanting to think a lot about “kids’ media” (man I hate that condescending term).I like “kids’ media” because it does so much of a better job sneaking mature themes in rather than the obviously adult media going “LOOK HOW ****** DARK AND EDGY WE ARE” - see: HBO Max’s Velma.Kids media doesn’t have to be exclusively for kids. It can be for everyone, it just takes the right execution, and screw people who think otherwise. I’m 25 and I still enjoy several kid-related franchises and shows and movies. Pixar is perhaps the shining example of this philosophy."
2023-01-20T03:32:04-0500,"Making it so the only buildings you can enter in the game are the school, the gym lobbies, the sandwich store and that restaraunt where you fight Larry makes this ""open world"" feel tiny and closed off. (Especially since most of them are tiny little square rooms). Was it really that necessary to appease people who would joke about player characters barging into strangers houses in RPGs to make the world feel so barren?"
2023-01-20T03:42:50-0500,"The benefit of this is that the game barely has any loading/transition screens or ""guardhouses"" littered all over the map that do nothing but connect the actually functional areas. That's worth something, and it's a notable QoL perk in a game that's otherwise full of performance issues.But it does make the world feel pretty empty at times. Like there ought to be at least one notable and unique building per city to explore. Or actual dungeons for the titan and/or legendary pokemon."
2023-01-20T17:34:40-0500,"I hate the new designs of the human characters in this gamethe player characters; for an anime aesthetic, they're coded as ugly"
2023-01-21T14:25:41-0500,"Disclaimer: I have no idea if any of these opinions are actually unpopular. But here goes!I think the Sprigatito line is amazing in every possible way and Meowscarada is one of my all-time favorite final stage starters. I'm very happy that Sprigatito stood up because it wouldn't have been nearly as awesome if it had stayed quadruped.The Fuecoco line is my least favorite starter line from ScaVio. I don't dislike it, but I just never saw the appeal in Fuecoco. Crocalor did not really improve upon it. Skeledirge on the other hand is the best member of the line, but at the same time, it feels very off compared to the pre-evolutions. I usually like when Pokémon evolutions take an unexpected twist, but here, it bothers me. I think I would have liked it better if the pre-evolutions had looked more similar to Skeledirge.From what I have seen, it seems like several fans were disappointed by Quaquaval, but I think it is fine. Not my favorite Water starter, but definitely my second favorite Paldea starter.I think the only real negative about the new Pokémon on the whole are the low number of new regional forms/evolutions.Being unable to enter most buildings wasn't as bad as I thought since it makes things a lot more convenient while shopping.I think the Let's Go feature outclasses the following Pokémon feature in every possible way since it actuallysomething, and it feels a lot more immersive than just having your Pokémon following behind you like a slave.The bad performance of the game didn't bother me all too much. I still consider it a negative since my game crashed once, but even so, I can live with it.However, one thing I consider to be a big negative is how battle animations can't be turned off. I think that's my second biggest issue with the games (the first one is obviously dexit).Nemona is a great rival. While not my favorite overall, she is still fantastic and I'll take her over Blue and Silver any day (those are the two most overrated rivals ever if you ask me).I think ScaVio are great games, but I think they are actually about equal to S/S (which I am also a big fan of). Though I think both are way better than L:A. With that said, I do prefer the way L:A handled the region design by having a linear open world, as opposed to a full open world.Tinkaton is the best Pokémon ever.Okay, that's definitely not unpopular."
2023-01-22T03:22:23-0500,"I feel like poor pacing via presentation (battle animations, # of menus/prompts, etc.) is an evergreen problem with the series. Some aspects improve or regress over time, but in general it always sticks out to me. Like I can still remember how glacial D/P's pace was and how much Pt tightened it up within the same gen.It's wild to me that trainer-to-trainer trades and box releases are still 1 Pokemon at a time. Compare it with how much has changed granularly over the decades for the many aspects of raising competitive pokemon. Trades aren't any speedier than they were on the Game Boy."
2023-01-22T11:50:00-0500,"They clearly like making trades an ""event"" and probably do not care that people might want to trade multiple things in a short period of time. Now you would think with how Surprise Trades work  (& encourage you to keep the train going) that they would make this a lot more instant, or at least have a faster variant, but....no. No they sure didn't huh.Mass box release meanwhile.... You'll note that Lets Go & Legends Arceus both have it, but I guarantee the logic is ""these aregames, you're capturing things all the time for resources but the normal games aren't that, qed there's no reason to have it because most people aren't capturing or filling in a million boxes""In the former, just about everyone is capturing a ton of Pokemon. In the latter, very few people are doing intensive breeding or shiny hunting through eggs for a finizen (my boxes are so full..........not to mention those hunts I did 3-fam Maushold and 3-segment Dudunsparces...), so they just do not see it as a thing that would be in there."
2023-01-25T21:09:52-0500,"For Regional Forms and Regional Evolutions, that’s understandable. Several more regional forms wouldn’t hurt anyone.For new traditional evolutions, I don’t think weany more of those this badly, since both it and LA just brought back traditional evolutions as concept for new Pokémon despite some caveats on the latters’ Pokémon. At the same tine, few more wouldn’t be a bad thing.As for the thread… Did anyone else thought we didn’t explored enough of Geeta’s questionable decisions in action?"
2023-01-25T21:28:12-0500,"I kind of floated it elsewhere, in the story thread I think, that we might get something more with Geeta (& perhaps the other characters in general) in DLC.Even ignoring the strangeness with Glimmora and that random errand she put Nemona on but didn't follow up with, it'd be a little odd (though, also, very interesting for a Champion) for the last impression of Geeta being ""she's a boss that everyone who works under her hates or is unnerved by"""
2023-01-26T15:20:31-0500,"Thought I'd voice my opinion on what I think Game Freak's mindset was going into this. From their perspective, the Paradox Pokémon must have felt like a sort of ""replacement"" of more traditional regional variants that also happens to fit better with the whole past and future theme of this game. I get that with the existence of Paldean Wooper, Clodsire, and Paldean Tauros, this argument only has so much to back it up, but at the end of the day can't one still make the argument that, say, Iron Bundle for example is really just ""Paldean Delibird"" with a fresh Metal Coat of paint?Also, just in case this comes up, Brute Bonnet could still be a Paldean Amoonguss even though the base variant can still show up in Paldea. I view these instances in a similar manner to how you can get a Kantonian Raichu or Marowak in the Alola games if you evolve a Pikachu or Cubone in Ultra Space respectively. (Exeggcute also works for this, but unlike the other two I can't actually remember where to find a wild Exeggcute in the Alola games off the top of my head.)"
2023-01-27T09:21:30-0500,"One major difference to point out is the BST of the Paradox Pokémon, often 570 BST and, in the case of Roaring Moon and Iron Valiant, 590 BST. I can see where are you getting at with them being essentially Paldean variants in all but name and BST.I wonder if there are more Paradox Pokémon planned for DLC in addition to the Imaginated ones (Scarlet Suicune and Violet Virizion)."
2023-02-02T23:51:47-0500,"The answer is, unsurprisingly, Exeggutor Island (also some other parts of Poni Island, but only in the original Sun/Moon)"
2023-02-03T12:15:33-0500,"I had a feeling this was the case, but not only has it been so long since I’ve played an Alola game for reals, but I was also thinking about Exeggutor Island being a late-game location, as such meaning the wild Pokémon would more likely be evolved."
2023-03-02T17:32:15-0500,I wanted Sprigatito to stand on both legs when it evolves from the start just to tick others off.
2023-03-03T11:24:50-0500,See the part that bothers me is going Quadruped to Bipedal. If Sprigatito had stood one 2 legs from the outset I don't think nearly as many people would give a shit.
2023-03-03T21:20:45-0500,Meh people still whinging about bipedal/quadrupedal stuff annoys me. Its been a thing amongst starters since Gen 2 (excluding Gen 4) and it happens in other evo lines and people don’t give a crap.
2023-03-03T23:28:32-0500,"It's more about bipedal=humanoid.Gen I: All starters keep the same stance, all remain similarly bestial.Gen II: Cyndaquilshifts stance, all remain similarly bestial.Gen III: Mudkipshifts stance, Blaziken becomes more humanoid.Gen IV: Chimcharshifts stance, all remain similarly bestial.Gen V: Serperior loses limbs, Samurott becomes quadripedal, Emboar becomes bipedal. Emboar becomes more humanoid, Samurott becomes more bestial.*this is where the problem starts*Gen VI: Delphox becomes bipedal. Delphox becomes more humanoid.Gen VII: Incineroar becomes bipedal. All 3 become more humanoid.Gen VIII: Inteleon becomes bipedal. All 3 become more humanoid.Gen IX: Meoscarada becomes bipedal. Meoscarada becomes more humanoid.Now, this is obviously subjective. But there was a shift around Gen VI to having the starters be more humanoid, have more distinct personalities built in, and be bipedal. People who object to one part of that are possibly objecting to all of it, just not being specific.Humorously, I don't object to bipedal, but I do very specifically object to humanoid. Fenniken and Sprigatito are adorable and their evos are awful."
2023-03-03T23:48:38-0500,"I actually quite like Floragato.  It looks cool, and its coolness is enhanced by a rose broach that doubles as a yo-yo.Meowscarada has fucky eyes and a strut.  I do not like it."
2023-03-04T01:39:04-0500,"100% agree with this. The humanoid proportions, poses, and distinctive personality traits make them feel too much like people instead of just intelligent animals. Even Pokemon that are abstractly based on humans in the past have not had as many distinctly human psychological traits (i.e. a Conkeldurr or Gothitelle does not feel like a person as much as Meowscarada). Cinderace is just straight up a guy in a soccer uniform. Meowscarada could easily be some spellcaster character in another work of fiction. It feels like these Pokemon are trying to more like individual characters than a species, which I don't like.It's not even just starters either, there's also Tinkaton, Palafin, and Maushold which do this. Even Mimikyu, a Pokemon I like, does this - it's basically designed as ""the character you're supposed to feel sorry for"" (though it doesn't seem as human as the others due to design and having ""personality"" traits which are less specifically human). There's more cases of this, these are just the best examples off the top of my head (I'd argue that Charcadet and Salazzle fall under this, but I decided to focus on clearer points first).Cynically, I feel like this trend is part of larger trends in marketing. There are a number of Pokemon seemingly designed to replicate the success of previously popular Pokemon (Cinderace taking traits from Incineroar and Greninja, Fidough playing a similar marketing role to Yamper). The influx of ""storytelling"" Pokemon which act more human seems like an attempt to replicate the ""specialness"" of Legendary/Mythical Pokemon (many of which also take more of a storytelling role and may actually specific individuals rather than an entire species), particularly the movie Mythicals. It doesn't seem like a coincidence given the increasing legendary spam over the generations."
2023-03-04T09:35:38-0500,"Based on the sharp contrast between (admittedly not-perfect coverage) Japanese and North American Pokemon popularity polls (seehttps://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/what-are-the-faces-of-gen-9.3715228/post-9509079for the only Japanese poll andhttps://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/what-are-the-faces-of-gen-9.3715228/post-9509167for the only North American poll I've been able to find for Gen 9 so far) and the Japanese poll results'favouritism towards Meowscarada while Meowscarada (arguably deservedly) doesn't show up on the American poll results at all (outside of its signature move), I'm wondering if Game Freak is making more humanoid Pokemon that are more human-like in behaviourbecause their Japanese audience unironically likes them and still wants more of them (unlike American fatigue).As for another example of ""more human-like behaviour"" along the lines of ""I wanna become a knight when I grow up!!"" Charcadet, I think Gholdengo is actually another good example of this that we players picked up on en masse. Explicitly based on surfers (see its Japanese copyrighted name Surfugo, its surfboard generation in-game, its dreadlocks, and one of its Pokedex entries mentioning that it is ""quick to make friends with anybody"" for further information), closer to human-looking than its pre-evolution Gimmighoul, flavour surrounding it emphasizing that it is friendly to and gets along well with others...I really do not think it's coincidence that one of Gholdengo's most popular nicknames is ""Golden Joe"". (Admittedly, its pre-evolution Gimmighoul's primary personality traits probably being aggressively wanting all your gold coins and then some, including whenever Gimmighoul-Roaming falls under the protection of a trainer, then draining life force from whoever tries to separate it from its gold do thankfully detract from the evolutionary line getting too close to human. There is a more than slight implication given the games' description of Gholdengo's Good as Gold ability that Gimmighoul cunningly values gold for its great physical and chemical properties instead of greedily wanting gold because it is valuable, though....)"
2023-03-04T12:33:25-0500,"Personally I ended up liking Meowscarada the best out of the three fully evolved forms. I agree it might have been a nice design if Meowscarada had more or less kept its look but was quadrupedal, looking a bit more like a Sphinx or something, I don't mind that it stands.While I appreciate that Quaxquaval wasn't just water Blaziken, I think the chicken bottom + humanoid top ends up looking worse than pure humanoid.For Skeledirge, I just cannot get over how its white head and mouth fire makes it look like a balding clown. It really ruins the design for me. Not a 'clowns are scary thing,' I just think it looks super ugly."
2023-03-04T13:07:46-0500,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasnt the whole ""starters all eventually become humanoid-ish"" a trend because it makes them more humanlike (duh) thus easier to get attached to for the kids, thus in turn, making mechandise selling easier?"
2023-03-04T13:14:56-0500,I feel like this is something I've heard a bunch but never had an interview attached to it.
2023-03-04T13:22:06-0500,"Meowscarada is fine as is and I don't want its design to be changed. Definitely my favorite of the 3 starters since it was first revealed and think its a marketed improvement over Delphox and Incineroar. It really nails the trickster theme its going for gameplay-wise too, learning all the sneaky moves like U-Turn, Knock Off, and Trick by level up. Also feels a bit more fun to use than in-game compared Cinderace despite its comparatively worse statline due to learning more physical moves by level up & egg move transfering letting it get its good egg moves easily. My one complaint about it is that its hidden ability is by far the worst of the three. Protean only has use of Choice sets, which is fine, but a bit limiting. Losing its amazing STAB combo on other sets makes it feel like a liability, especially since its STAB combo is all it needs most of the time. I wish its signature ability was something more practically useful, like Hustle, Sniper, or Magic Guard.Violet Paradoxes are cool. I like their chrome textures, esp on the shiny forms. and the futuristic neon energy lights most of them have are a nice touch too. The only thing I dislike about them are some gameplay related things, i.e movepool oddities like Iron Jugulis not getting Nasty Plot."
2023-03-04T13:23:10-0500,"Yuck. I hate both Incineroar and Primarina. Too similar to Emboar for one, and shoved down my throat for Smash.Sounds about right."
2023-03-20T02:04:37-0400,"So I watched my nephew play Pokemon Violet for the second straight Sunday this evening. Day 1 actually wasn't too bad. Today convinced me that Pokemon Violet's open-world implementation was even worse than I feared:even though I looked away from the TV about every 5 minutes and I was always behind the sofa. Game Freak has my sister's money, but it won't have mine until they stop making open-world games.I remain convinced that Game Freak is losing a noticeable amount of their otherwise paying audience making nausea-inducing open-world games.On another note, the worst part of the Pokemon Violet viewing experience tonight wasn't the jerky legs and walking, and it wasn't the disappearing Miraidon or Pokeball thrower. It wasn't even the lag after my nephew plunges Miraidon into a water area yet again before it learns how to swim.It was the camera occasionally dropping to the ground and zooming in on the player character and pointing skyward.This leads to some less-than-intuitive experiences trying to control the player character (at least IMO) and probably helped make me motion sick watching Pokemon Violet on-and-off tonight."
2023-03-20T02:57:06-0400,"I personally haven’t had this issue in ~120 hours, or haven’t noticed it. I doubt GF is losing much either since I haven’t seen this mentioned at all anywhere else, and a huge portion of sales come prior to any reviews being posted."
2023-03-20T03:53:53-0400,"I suspect I'm one of the unlucky <5% who get dizzy and motion sick playing or watching certain video games, but even that percentage has to be a noticeable audience.As for the camera issue, my nephew triggered that multiple times tonight and a week ago each. I only noticed the disappearing Miraidon and the disappearing Pokeball-throwing trainer (whose Pokeball amusingly did not disappear) tonight and once each."
2023-03-20T07:52:00-0400,"There are other reasons to dislike open-world games besides nausea. In my case, interest in exploring 90% of the environment is not enough to be worth the tradeoffs made to the difficulty curve and the other 10% of the environment is the only area that's closed off. Though unfortunately for both of us, it probably isn't a net loss for GF even though it is a loss."
2023-03-20T08:06:23-0400,"I would point that, not specifically linked to your issue with visual sickness, when a franchise does a change in direction (in this case, moving from linear to open world), it's guaranteed that a certain chunk of the playerbase may get discouraged or stop playing/buying altogether due to not liking the new system.What the companies usually bank on is that the new players you will attract will outweight the ones you lose.Ultimately expecially in modern era, you can't please everyone."
2023-03-20T08:15:50-0400,"The Sun + Moon anime series does have a Mimikyu who’s rotten-to-the-core that resent the Pikachu species’ popularity, which is noted as a large contrast to other members of it’s species. GF should not make the species feeling one-note in terms of potential personality between each species, otherwise it makes them too rigid for fanmade contents by making fans complacent about the species so-called behaviors.Meanwhile, I’m having mixed feelings about this generation’s power creep.One one hand, GF really took one step forward, two step backward considering an attempt of rebalancing Zacian (Zamazenta’s nerf isn’t so bad since it did get Body Press + wouldn’t care about Intimidate as much as the sword counterpart would), making sure Terastalization isn’t overwhelming like Dynamax and succeeded for the most part, and making Protean a lot less oppressive, but then we have even more overpowered moves and Pokémon within a single generation, to the point where plenty of Paldea-introduced non-Legendary Pokémon got either quickbanned or suspect banned within few months after Scarlet + Violet release, making their balancing act not sincere at all.But on the other hand, barring a few stinkers, they did succeeded at making many of the newcomers useful for in-game and competitive, so it’s nice to see many new faces in Singles OU and Doubles OU, as well as VGC. It helps that most signature move and / or Ability were actually useful and gel well with the Pokémon’s toolkit, even it ended up working too well in a few cases.Truth is, the power creep in earlier generations aren’t that bad, and it were the Pseudo-Legends, Legendary, Mythical and other restricted Pokémon to put the blame for it, since those from later generations were oftentimes blatantly better than what came before. While Gen 5 and, when considering Mega Evolution, Gen 6, were arguable exceptions, it wasn’t until Generation 9 that things went into an overdrive. Though Gen 8 can be considered as a harbringer."
2023-03-20T09:08:52-0400,"As a singles player myself, this seems a bit harsh on the balancing. Given they tend to balance the game around Doubles as the format they're trying to make an eSport out of, the Generation has had some banworthy mons, but I also think Singles has gained a decent number of influential-but-not-stupid Pokemon like Skeledirge and Meowscarada, Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and of course Great Tusk.Of the Tiering Actions that have happened so far, several of them are Pokemon that definitely are only busted in a 6v6 Singles context (Last Resorts having more faints for power, Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, Cyclizar for Shed Tail spam, for example), Terastalization got looked at but so far is considered balanced, and Espathra legitimately feels like an accident in that regard as a one-mon Baton Pass chain. Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle seem like the only ones that stick out so far as massive misteps since they seem to have VGC viability on top of Min-Maxed Singles play.I wouldn't call the effort perfect but I can't call the balancing act insincere just based on this, every Gen's had some stand out players, especially if we include the ""big"" players like Pseudos or Megas (Garchomp in Gen 4, a lot of Weather Abusers in Gen 5, several Gen 6 Megas, UB's like Pheromosa and Naganadel in Gen 7, etc)"
2023-03-20T21:40:45-0400,"The difficulty curve isn't that hard to fix, GF just...didn't. Now, Pokemon would find it harder than something like Skyrim or Dark Souls, where player skill and build are much more important than raw stats. A lvl 1 run of Skyrim which beats every boss is perfectly plausible. In Pokemon, if you're lvl 30 walking into a lvl 40 boss fight, good luck. So I get that fixing the difficulty would take a delicate touch. But there's several ways GF could have handled ""each boss fight gets harder as you progress, you are expected to level-up to compensate"" that wouldn't have been ""we've randomly scattered the various bosses around the map, each of them has a set level, and there's no in-game indication which is the next-most-powerful."""
2023-03-23T15:15:40-0400,"To be honest, I was thinking if the real question is what the actual intend about the difficulty curve was.While our expectation was that ""trials can be beaten in any order""m there's a part of me that believes that the actual intent was to create scenarios where the player attempts a gym (or trainer, or story beat, or something) and gets absolutely murdered to create the ""I'll come back when I'm stronger"" scenario. Incidentally what happened to me a couple times.Which isn't too different from back when in older pokemon games (as well as several other RPGs) you could tecnically access higher level areas right away yet you'd get destroyed by the encounters. It isn't even a huge deal in Pokemon considering there's basically 0 penalty from getting defeated other than a minor money loss.Skyrim is often considered how ""level scaling done right"" works, but even that one is imperfect, with a decent chunk of people often complaining that the system defeats the point of growing up your character if the relative difficulty of the game stays the same, so the aspect of ""getting stronger"" is completely removed when you're the almighty Dragonborn vanquisher of dragons and yet even the bandits near the starting area are as strong as the ones in the rest of the world for no apparent reason.There are also plenty of examples of games/series that attempted level scaling and it fucking sucked, with I think the most glaring example being Final Fantasy 8, which is infamous for how the game actually is easier at level 1 than it is at level cap, by a combination of the power you can gain from external sources (Junctions, magic) being way higher at lower level compared to the enemy strenght. (You can get basically maxed stats while having lower than level 10...)All in all, as I said at start... I do wonder if they actually *want* you to lose. Some games are designed in a way that you're meant to find out by ""rude awakening"" when you are challenging something stronger than you.Though if that was the case... the game really should have given some kind of better hint about the actual level of a given gym/trial."
2023-03-23T15:45:53-0400,Dudunsparce is a perfect evolution. Dunsparce was a dorky Pokémon and I am glad its evolution remains a dorky Pokémon. He is My Son and can do no wrong.
2023-03-23T16:19:01-0400,"I agree that the intention was likely that the player would settle in to doing the quests in level order after being pushed back. However, I think that they wouldn't be able to catch players with the same setup if the levels were clearly delineated since I expect more casual players will just follow the sequence anyway. Effectively, I think the part that breaks the system is that the bosses are too easy. You have players accidentally sequence breaking because they didn't notice they were supposed to lose, which then ruins anything they skipped over because those encounters aren't capable of being engaging to a higher-level party. Spreading out the bosses' levels (either by reducing their number or using more of the level range, pokemon games don't really do anything past lvl75) might help, in additon to the obvious answer of increasing the challenge."
2023-03-23T16:55:49-0400,"Honestly I don't think there was a ""good"" way to work this system in the way they orchestrated SV.In general I think that, if my assumption is right, it's a design that wouldn't really work in a turn based rpg like Pokemon, specifically because of what you said, if you do sequence break (either intentionally or accidentally) suddently the rest of the game becomes a joke.A very recent game that I still consider a masterpiece despite this issue, in fact two, are Octopath Traveler I and II. These games operate on a similar design concept, you have a open map, 99% of the map is open right from the start (everything except chapter specific dungeons), and you can tackle every of the 8 char stories in any order. The locations and level of every chapter are shown clearly on the map, and yet, it's basically inevitable that you will eventually overlevel some of them, simply because by the time you finished two of the last chapters, your ""main party"" is signifcantly higher level than the chapters and will often end up carrying everyone else, thus making the first 2-3 stories you finish pretty challenging and all others usually a breeze.(Absolutely great games btw, 100% recommend if you're into oldschool turn based jrpgs)I just... don't think there's a good way to do this, it's a inherent flaw of leaving the player free to sequence break but also not wanting to do level scaling.Overally I think Pokemon should just adopt level scaling for gyms (and similar challenges), have them have multiple teams and pick whichever the player level is closer to, maybe with a upper cap of 60-70 (aka their rematch). Ultimately this is canon in the anime (several gym leaders do say they pick their teams based on opponent's experience) and basically also canon in the games since rematches exist. Plus iirc, the bug gym leader in SV literally complains that she's always forced to use her weak pokemon because she's often the first gym the students take due to being the closest so she has to go easy on them."
2023-03-23T21:43:30-0400,Same with Nemona only being able to go all out when we’re done.
2023-03-24T23:35:48-0400,"There's even a ""Tell me where to go next"" feature at the pokemon centers that doesn't actually point you to the next leveled boss for some reason.Ways to fix the level curve:Level scale the bosses based on your badge count. (obvious)Make it more obvious where to go next/make the boss route more linear. (Basically, make the route up each side of the map very clearly point you towards the next boss sequentially instead of jumping around and having large gaps on each side)Include a few more roadblocks to keep players to low/mid/high level areas better(either make it impossible to sequence break, or at least harder. Don't have a 20+ level jump from crossing an unattended bridge)Some non-battle related badges(this wouldn't fix anything, it'd just be a nice change.)Rework the entire fight system to not be so level-dependent. (not happening)Probably other stuff I'm forgetting"
2023-03-30T09:08:44-0400,"There's a (perhaps foolish) part of me that thinks that while the main stat and damage calculation is strongly tied to level, it's still possible to have fights that don't lean as heavily on level as the current ones by using more of the other mechanics and less direct damage.  F.E.A.R. is the gimmicky extreme end of this idea: as long as the opponent is capable of knocking down the user to 1HP, no other stats are relevant."
2023-03-30T09:47:08-0400,"Some games do use actual ""damage scaling"" based on levels.One of the most recent infamous cases is SMTV, where if you're significantly higher / lower level than the enemy, there are massive damage buffs / penalties at play, to the point where if you're 5 or more lvls below a enemy you basically do negligible damage yet get absolutely deleted by them. It is still possible to beat bosses underleveled (speedruns do that) but it requires significantly more game knowledge and planning on top of luck.I wouldn't exactly trust GF to make this kind of level scaling work, but it is something some other games do."
2023-05-06T19:32:02-0400,"if one more person complains about how buggy sv is, i will commit a crime of an unspecified but non-insignificant scale.  game freak has to pump out a new pokemon game every three years, otherwise no new pokemon come out.  that means the anime stops, the merch stops, to some extent the card game stops, and all sources of income for gamefreak are halted until new pokemon come out.  and these pokemon have to be good.  when people bring up gen 5 pokemon, do they bring up bisharp, volcarona, zoruark, hydreigon, haxorus, krookadile, or any of the other cool pokemon it has to offer.  no.  they only bring up the lines of kling, vanilite, the monkeys, and garbodor.  those are just 14 of the 156 new pokemon introduced in gen 5, and yet they are the ones that get all the attention.  and thats just the concepts they have to come up with.  they also have to implimant the data for all of the previous pokemon they made, all in the best graphics feasable for the time.  this may have been fine when there were only 300 pokemon, but in case you havent noticed, theres a bit more than that now.  they have to code over 1000 pokemon in 3 years, while also coming up with new concepts for pokemon, people, places, and stories.  they tried to mitigate this by including only some of the pokemon, but despite there being statistically 0 people who like heatmor, fans were outraged that game freak were hesitant to not include over 1000 pokemon in the new games.  thats not the only shortcuts they tried to take to keep their buisness afloat.  sword and shield is a very unpopular game, and yet few people try to ask why it was so bad.  if they want to impliment 1000 different pokemon, a bunch of flashy mechanics, a giant world to explore, a compelling story, ballenced gameplay, and new creative designs, thats gonna cost the weekends of the aproxamately 400 employees who worked tirelessly to make sure the game was even released on time.  people like to complain about the situation the games come out in, but under these circumstances, they were gonna complain no matter how the game came out, unless it were to be delayed, which is not an option if game freak wants to keep their buisness running.  do you have any idea how cruel the japanese coding industry already is on the workers?  they worked tirelessly to feed their families, and you have the audacity to insult their results?"
2023-05-06T21:30:16-0400,"I just recently got around to finishing the main story of Violet for the first time, and while I haven’t had any major issues with the game myself, there may be people that have had issues with this game and/or the other Switch core series games. With a multimedia franchise with as big of dreams as Pokémon, trying to please everyone was not an option from the very start. They have to satisfy so many people and ask if their efforts will be worth it, because we all know Game Freak as a company is entirely carried by the core series Pokémon titles at this rate. As for The Pokémon Company International, they’re out here trying to make ends meet every three years like you said… so what’s the problem here if it’s not Pokémon’s fault?Simply put, a lot of your comments, while perfectly valid, such as that on the Japanese coding industry for instance, are hurt significantly by the fact that other Japanese IPs don’t have many of the issues that the modern Pokémon games do. It speaks volumes about product quality that franchises like The Legend of Zelda, Xenoblade Chronicles, et cetera can run perfectly fine on the Nintendo Switch hardware when they have enough time to cook in the oven. I’m almost positive Pokémon fans would be more than willing to pay $60 a year for new corse series games that weren’t released on such a tight schedule.The problem as I see it isn’t anything Nintendo, Game Freak, or The Pokémon Company have done.  Rather, this seems to be an issue of poor communication between all three, and for whatever reason this has resulted in the Pokémon franchise as a whole developing an unhealthy phobia of wanting to delay their newest products until they’re up to the standard of quality consumers should expect from a $60 first-party title. In other words, it’s not just the core series games that should be delayed. The next generation of merchandising on all fronts would have to be delayed so the guys over at Game Freak can have time to play catch-up."
2023-05-06T22:00:32-0400,"Elite 4 and Geeta was a letdownThe rivals were great though, especially Nemona, she was the best rival ever for the whole game. But, the world map sucks. It’s a critical part of every open world game and Scarlet/Violet's map really aggravated me.Also the overlaid grid is just a transparent layer that does not change when you zoom in or out. It's just a clunky decoration."
2023-05-06T22:22:09-0400,"Tbfh, to be precise, the people who complain about SV quality that aren't just being pepegas for the sake of it, are complaining of GameFreak's leadership's choice to not expand the development teams nor seeking help from other Nintendo studios.Anyone with a grain of salt knows this isnt the employee's fault, if anything they're likely suffering from the poor reception on top of the amount of threats they got last generation.That doesn't remotely excuse the poor decisions of the leadership.They've always been notoriously bad with 3d graphics, and the game development suffers greatly from it. As you said, this isnt 2d games anymore, the ""small staff"" doesn't cut it anymore.If they didn't own 33% of the IP, chances are they'd have been all fired ages ago and TPCI would have hired a different company for the games.And honestly, Monolith studios are a 260-ish employees company also owned by Nintendo and is capable of producing masterpieces like the Xenoblade series on the same platform. GameFreaks have 170-ish employees and still pretend they are able to keep up with the ""one game per year"" release cycle that Nintendo demands of them.Whatever the fuck GameFreak's leadership is doing, it's been horribly hurting the quality of the games for a while, and probably the psyche of their employees too."
2023-05-06T23:34:30-0400,"I feel the need to point out that while Nintendo likely bears some blame in so far as they also own a third of TPC and likely does influence developmental decisions and timelines and could likely step in and go ""hey we're not doing this"" as much as they can ""hey we're doing this""  it probably is far more on Gamefreak who are the ones actually developing the game, the ones presenting their game plans to Nintendo for approval, the ones working with Nintendo on the timelines, and the ones that provide that guidance for the conglomerate of TPC's various other stuff based on what they're doing.Also want to point out while we're here that the remaining third is fucking Creatures Inc.Literally a company dedicated to this!Anyway all that aside the series would easily be able to, like, delay things if needed. Hell it already has: the SV TCG set didn't start until a few months after the games came out and the anime didn't start up until April. And the anime barely even needs to be about the new games at this point; and the TCG certainly doesn't either. And there's plenty of non-Gen 9 merch lines they can put out, or merch focused on ones already revealed.And above all they can literally just go from the start of development ""this will be a 4 year dev cycle"" if they want, and everything is planned around that. But they don't. GameFreak themselves likely feels there wasn't a problem despite all the problems.now that they had to publically apologize for how buggy the game was maybe they'll go ""perhaps the next one can be longer in the oven"" but that likely won't help thenext game that's likely locked in."
2023-05-07T08:03:20-0400,"I'm at the point where my interest in the current mainline games isn't enough for me to buy them, so while a game might be releasing every year I sure haven't been playing a new pokemon game each year. Effectively, a longer dev cycle that leads to a more complete experience stands toincreasethe number of new games I would be buying and playing."
2023-05-07T10:00:44-0400,"your asking them to stop all means of income for them, just to apeal to some ungrateful crybabys that cant handle games having bugs in them, even though gen 1 exists.  thats not happening even if game freak wanted it to happen, because they are a second party developer for nintendo.  all the complaining about the bugs is doing is ruining some japanese programmers day."
2023-05-07T11:15:03-0400,I can't believe Gen 9 delays stop the sales of their 300 Charizard Toys.Real talk though this is a point for stretching the Gens out more to me. I barely had time to remember or internalize most of the Gen 7 and 8 mons outside of the big Mainstay Legendaries with Anime appearances because by the time I got a feel for any of them we were on to something else.Iron out the games before jumping into the next Gen both so the new games function better (I love SV's design and region but the 18 FPS genuinely hurts my eyes if I play as long as I usually would a game) and so that the old ones have time to make more than a superficial impact on the brand.
2023-05-07T11:55:55-0400,"No, because they can just keep making merch of the stuff they already have, until a new game is out. It'll be okay, I promise the entire pokemon apparatus won't spiral out of control if they have to go another year without brand new Pokemon (even ignoring that if they revealed it earlier as teases they have Pokemon to make merch of anyway)I will say as a minor aside, the the point of ""I barely had time to remember/internalize"" might be more of a you thing. The 3-year cycle has been a thing for a long time. Gen 2 -> Gen 3 was about 3 years, Gen 5-> Gen 6 about 3 years, Gen 6-> 7 about 3, 7 -> 8 about 3 too.Excusing Gen 1-> 2 since that whole thing is kind of a mess that involved a full reboot of what GS would even really be, Gen 3 -> 4 was the only time we had a 4 year cycle.., certainly, but I think that it's not a year, per say, that really stops you from internalizing it. There can be all kinds of factors. Not as young, disinterest in the franchise orspecific game, there's a ton of Pokemon now, playing other things taking up your time/mental space, real world stuff, etc, etc.Like, personally & anecdotally,  I have no problems interliazing these generations. I know other people who likewise dont have much of an issue. I also know people who never internalized anything after gen 1 or gen 2, even in the generations they still really liked.Another year in the oven could have helped but it also easily have just still not internalized them for you, is what I'm saying."
2023-05-07T12:07:22-0400,"Personally I haven’t had any glitches or bugs in Violet or even framerate issues. Honestly it feels very overblown. BotW has many glitches but I never saw people whinging about that (obviously it is a better overall game, plus many of those can end up being used in a positive way). If a game is worse people will whinge more about stuff like this just to denigrate it further. Plus these things get completely overblown by people posting shit on the internet and whining when the glitches themselves are extremely rare.I’ve learned to block out these sorts of criticisms of video games in general over the years."
2023-05-07T12:22:35-0400,"Look sir idk what kind of emulator you are using, but there is no way you havent noticed the absolutely massive fps drops in the lake area"
2023-05-07T12:52:06-0400,"and people wont by 5 different versions of the same pokemon.  new pokemon boost merch sales drastically.  the point im trying to make is that from an economic standpoint, waiting even a year longer in between games is not an option.  as a second party developer, they are under a lot of stress to  make as much money as possible, and that means cutting corners to get the games out on time.  if you have a solution for them that dosent involve shouting at them to do better or telling them to take their time and dont worry about their income, (like for example: maybe dont do it in hd, take pokemon concepts from fans, debug using known glitch hunters, cut out move animations, ect.) they would probobly love to hear it.  but complaining about the final product will only get the games and the game makers undeserved hate, and ruin everyones day.  this isnt a leadership problem, this isnt a technical issue, this is an unavoidable side effect of trying to keep up with the demand of the highest grossing media franchise of all time.  even now, the devs are still working tirelessly to fix the issues with the game, even though its already out.  no one here is in a position to critisize gamefreak for this, and it makes my blood boil every time i see someone do this."
2023-05-07T12:58:37-0400,"they absolutely positively will buy them, shown if nothing else by them. People will buy merch because it looks cool or because it has their favorite. Some lines are Eternal Sellers.It is one (1) extra year. It would be fine. There's a ton of Pokemon, they can find new little lines to create and put out.or as I mentioned before, put out merch of revealed Pokemon. Or both!or the lag in the various cities or in mesagoza, or the very public memory leak glitches at launch or seeing all the pokemon enter their T Pose or simply running around and just seeing the game stutter trying to handle Koraidon's speed + loading in the next area + spawning the Pokemon. Or anything going on in Raids, the jankiest battle stye.The really bad glitches are relatively rare, but the game is absolutely full of them and really easy to notice just by casually playing the game. Like I like the game! I like running around Paldea! It is impossible not to notice the jank and framerate."
2023-05-07T13:46:31-0400,My favorite is the information (admittedly hearsay) that apparently one of the contributors to Scarlet being preferred for Speed Runs is because Miraidon's particle and light effects make the game more prone to slowdown.
2023-05-07T13:53:25-0400,"Violet does lag compared to Scarlet, but it's not because of Miraidon since runners lose time even before they get the mount.  Nobody actually knows why it lags.Violet also has an out-of-place loading zone in Area Zero, which would save time if not for the constant lag."
2023-05-07T22:32:18-0400,"My issue isn't framerate or glitches, it's the draw distance. I mean, I get minor movement glitches on a regular basis on the Ride Mon, but they're not a big deal, and I can handle lag. But mons appear next to me if I'm sprinting fast enough, which does not make moving around smooth or easy."
2023-05-08T18:05:46-0400,"Sorry to disappoint, but no I haven’t. If there is one, it hasn’t affected my gameplay experience at all.I have had certain lag issues in Online Raids, but I’ve yet to come across a game with online features where this is not an issue… so no complaints here."
2023-05-08T19:58:14-0400,"I don't even mean lag in raids, I mean things like desynching the turns, the text boxes not working properly, wasting time by showing the actions of another turn when it shouldn't be, the ability of the game to just not acknowledge that the enemy is actually dead for like 2full turns even when doing a CPU raid."
2023-05-09T01:50:48-0400,I don't understand why they can't just get help from another Japanese developer. More manpower can't hurt can it?
2023-05-09T03:03:51-0400,"So how's the taste of boot?But seriously, there is so much wrong with this. Even if Game Freak stopped making Pokémon games, they would still make an insane amount of money from merchandise as long as we're alive, as that's where the vast majority of the money comes from. Charizard, Pikachu, and Eevee sell well enough, there's no need for new Pokémon every three years. All the games clearly reuse a lot of code, so no they don't have to code ""1000+ Pokémon"" every single time. Also, ""best graphics feasable for the time""? Don't make me laugh. Also, that's a big strawman of people who don't like Dexit, it's easy to make it sound silly by focusing on one Pokémon, but when hundreds are missing it's easy to see why people are upset, especially when features such as graphics, online play, etc. are not improved nearly enough to compensate. You can appeal to the poor Japanese workers all you want, but by shutting down all criticism, you are defending this system. Scarlet and Violet is a mess that is so buggy that Sonic Boom laughs at it, has online play that would have been seen as lackluster in the 2000s, has less content than the Gen V games, and graphically looks like it could have been on the PS2. And the thing is,, higher than Marvel, higher than Star Wars, so there is absolutely no excuse for this crap! Game Freak doesn't care about what they're doing because they know they'll make money either way (hell, Scarlet and Violet sold as much as Elden Ring!), and things would be much better for both the fans and the workers if they stopped, but apparently it's not enough that they're already the highest-grossing media franchise, they just need to squeeze out every last penny."
2023-05-09T03:13:21-0400,"GameFreaks doesn't make the merchandise.That one goes to Pokemon Company.I think you may be not aware that the games are the only thing GameFreaks makes and gets money from, everything else is TPCI and Nintendo."
2023-05-09T05:31:53-0400,"Is that really the case though? Wouldn’t the directors like Masuda, Ohmori, and Takao Unno also get some of the money, especially since the former works at TPC now,"
2023-05-09T10:48:17-0400,"So a quick perusal of the Wikipedia page lists TPC as a joint investment between the Companies of GF, Nintendo, and Creatures (as opposed to just individuals within those companies), so my guess is that Gamefreak does majority work on the games and there are some terms in place about how revenue from the various branches of the franchise are distributed in turn.Of note is that apparently Nintendo specifically handles international publishing of the Console Pokemon titles (and the Console version of multi-plat releases like Pokemon Unite) compared to TPC in Japan in particular (not sure if this remains true for SV but was true as recently as Unite in 2021). With little basis beyond that, my interpretation would be that GF gets a larger ""cut"" of sales of the game among the Japanese audience due to having a (larger) stake in the publishing entity there compared to abroad, which by extension would mean they're more concerned with Japanese feedback about the products in particular unless prodded on it by shareholders/the other companies."
2023-05-09T13:30:16-0400,"I really don't think that Scarlet and Violet were released in as bad of shape as everyone says they were. It might just be me, but I've had multiple playthroughs of both games and there have been little to no noticeable bugs, glitches, or anything of the like. Some of the famous examples just seem a bit... exaggerated?Also an honorary mention to an opinion that isn't so uncommon. THERE ARE SO MANY STORY CUTSCENES! Seriously, if you watched the WR Pokemon Scarlet Any% runs, you see that the runner has a40 MINUTEgap between the game starting and when the runner is finally set free to go catch Flamigo. Sure, a bit of story is nice, but why is there so much??? It's honestly just too much. I don't want to mash ""A"" for any longer than like a minute."
2023-05-09T13:37:52-0400,Someone has never played a final fantasy or persona game before
2023-05-09T13:42:13-0400,"As someone who has played several Final Fantasy games (and thinks Persona is prone to overdoing this at times), I think the issue is less the amount of story cutscenes for me than their density at the beginning.You have the near hour long intro with meeting Nemona, the Ride Dragon, enrolling in the school, and finally starting the treasure hunt, and then after that you get maybe a 2 minute cutscene every 25-30 minutes on the objectives, many of which are fairly ""templated"" in several parts (Penny showing up after a Star Base, Arven's sit down to make a sandwich, etc). The end game in Area Zero goes back to a more frequent but still fairly tame pace for cutscenes now that you're back to a controlled/linear progression, and I think the intro would have done well to streamline things a bit more to that kind of rate, like maybe starting off the individual routes with their respective tutorial battles (Nemona's first use of Terastalization with the Pawmi outside Mesagoza), Arven giving you Koraidon/Miraidon's Pokeball, and Penny being ""recruited"" by Team Star) instead of placing them all before they open the world up to you."
2023-05-09T14:32:39-0400,"To be honest, I was kinda memeing on that, but as far as speedruns go, we've been memeing in long time how in some of the older rpgs like P3, the run beats the tutorial boss after over a hour and half.I don't think that ""1 hour until the starter"" is a huge deal, what I still don't like is that they *still* don't let you skip cutscenes or similar things. Which hurts even more due to lack of voice acting (hurted much more in L.A imo). Most games by now either have cutscene skips, fast forward, or ""press here to skip the tutorial"".Pokemon games could really use starting to do these...Then again, they still don't want you to have multiple saves, I guess they don't even consider the fact someone may want to ""reset and replay the game"" as a thing."
2023-05-09T14:40:15-0400,"i'm gonna be cancelled for thispokemon unite might be better than scarlet and violet, fight me on that."
2023-05-28T20:42:00-0400,"Please bear in mind that this is not only the first time I've been on here for at least a year, but that Violet version is my new first (Pokemon) game since Ultra Moon.Don't know if this is an unpopular opinion, but while Mints are nice and all, I wish that they kept the out-of-battle Synchronize ability as a secondary method to obtain the preferred nature. Ever since at least as early as Sun/Moon, I'd start farming for Synchronizers right away. It was kind of part of my way of settling into a new region.And now that practice has been rendered moot, and I have to wait until I start finding these Mints instead."
2023-05-28T21:24:15-0400,You can buy them wholesale in the game. No need to hope for finding the one you need on the overworld or grinding for BP like in Sword and Shield.
2023-05-28T23:07:23-0400,"That is one experience I am more than happy to skip. Grinding for BPs just to get the right nature...nope, just a ton of nope."
2023-05-29T08:45:34-0400,"I love that too, its really a good step forward to making Pokemon more accessible as an Esport, (and facility type battles if they return in the DLC)"
2023-05-29T08:58:06-0400,"Kind sir, can you share your source of copium, I too would like some of this :("
2023-05-30T21:22:30-0400,"I just found another thing that I liked that S/V has gotten rid of: breeding egg moves onto hatchlings.I just found this out after transferring some hatchlings from Ultra Moon.I'm sure that most of these moves can be replaced with TMs and leveling up in due time. But one of the most fun parts of breeding was choosing four moves, and breeding them on, and made Pokemon that would give otherwise useful a purpose. It also made receiving Wonder Trades all the more fun, and I imagine that many new players enjoyed the breeding spitbacks I randomly unleashed on the Wonder Trade network.Sure, it made the hatchlings even more ridiculously powerful, but that too was part of the fun of raising them! I wish that they kept the egg moves, even if only for older Pokemon, as a legacy to Gen II. I loved how Gen 5 made stacking egg moves easier, and I used the hell out of that starting in Gen 6!I will mourn those days, perhaps even more than the days of being able to transfer whatever Pokemon you like to every new game."
2023-05-30T21:38:49-0400,"You can still put the egg(/etc) moves you learned onto those Pokemon in most cases, you just have to use Home's move reminder. It'll remember egg moves and stuff."
2023-05-30T22:34:15-0400,"That's nice to know, if they ever make egg moves usable in game again.I bred Iron Tail onto my Gible for example."
2023-05-30T23:07:00-0400,"Uh... Gible just doesn't learn Iron Tail this Gen, but Egg moves as a concept are still around and work exactly how they did in previous games as a baseline!New Pokémon do also have full sets of Egg moves as usual, since you asked. (For instance, Shroodle's Egg moves are Toxic, Super Fang, Swagger, Copycat, Cross Poison and Parting Shot - that's a big selection with options it can use really well!)If breeding for them is your preference and that's all you wanted to know, they definitely didn't take anything away there!In addition to that, they made it by far theit's ever been to get Egg moves onto already-hatched Pokémon using a Mirror Herb.That's one of the new items in Gen IX - during a picnic, it instantly copies Egg moves from other Pokémon in the team to the holder if it has a free move slot, and it doesn't even get consumed so you can keep reusing it. In general, customizing movepools with stuff like this is more efficient than it's ever been, since deleting and remembering moves is just part of the regular menu now.This makes Egg moves usable for a casual run in-game in a way they have basically never been - the next-closest things were getting one Egg move at a time from wild Pokémon through DexNav in ORAS or the Grand Underground in BDSP, but now you can easily get as many Egg moves as you want onto the same Pokémon without replacing it or even going all that far out of your way.What R_N told you is a way to get Egg moves back onto your old hatchlings from Ultra MoonScarlet and Violet - youuse them in-game... just as long as they're still part of the Pokémon's current-Gen movepool.Iron Tail for Gible is an unlucky exception, but I'm sure most of your hatchlings can rememberof their Egg moves.It seems like the weird exceptions and losses are moves thathappened to be TMs and TRs in SwSh, but not in SV. (SwSh Iron Tail removed from Gible's Egg movepool because it was a TR anyway, and SV just didn't put it back, so it lost it more or less by accident.)"
2023-05-31T17:30:28-0400,"Okay, let’s see what happens if I try this…Torkoal’s moves like Clear Smog, Eruptionand Flame Burst are missing from the relearnable movepool.Same thing for every other hatching actually. Every egg move they hatched with in Ultra Moon are not relearnable, outside of leveling up and TMs.It’s great that Pokémon can still be hatched with egg move in Violet. But it sucks that you can’t transfer them from previous games. I haven’t tried it with moves only in the Violet egg move pool yet, which I might have to try."
2023-06-04T22:53:05-0400,"First of all, Comparing SV (a 20 million dollar game) to TotK (a likely >120 million dollar game) isn’t fair, secondly, your switch has performance issues. Sound like your machine has a skill issue to me. AlsoDo you see my point?Also, SV is peak PokémonYeah. I said it"
2023-06-06T11:25:08-0400,"Okay, so S/V (or the post Gen 7 games in general) have a number of issues that I'd like to see fixed.-The inability to transfer Pokemon with moves obtained via TMs and Egg moves from previous games, even if those moves could still otherwise be obtained by those same methods. It has made breeding moves in Gen 7 useless, seeing as how they will be automatically deleted during the transition to Violet version.-I'd like to be able to grow berries again-There are some moves I won't miss that have been removed, such as Bestow. Good for them, nobody cares! Then there are some such as Flame Burst (in this case, a move that served as a nice mid-level gap between Ember and higher-tier moves) that I wish that they kept in the game. It would be like removing moves like Psybeam or Aurora Beam, for example.But I've also found that Gen 9 is the most fun I've had in a Pokémon game in a long time.-3D models of Pokémon with greater detail and character than in Gen 7-A wilderness so vast, it takes at least an hour to fully explore each part, and it is so easy to get lost, with constantly regenerating item. Every time into the wilderness is like a treasure hunt. Also, I think that hunting for Gimmieghoul coins is another noteworthy addition, and it's fun looking for the little guys! Even in towns and cities, you might find items on the roofs, making full use of the box legendary. All and all, you can do more than just run around, even when you get to the point where you're mostly just breeding.-Access to areas with high-level Pokémon. I've even encountered Pokémon with levels at 60 before my third gym badge. This would be terrifying to younger players, but offers a challenge to more experienced players like us. Even a level 40 Veluza was impossible for me to stop a couple of days ago, but the good news is that my Pokémon are growing fast, and could probably give that same fish Pokémon some trouble now! Paldea is more like how I imagined the Pokémon world would be: filled with a vast wilderness full of surprised and dangerous creatures. If anything, wild Pokémon are more of a challenger than the Gym Leaders! I have also found that this game offers more opportunities to catch evolutions than in any previous game, making it easier to fill out the Pokedex faster than ever before! I've already spotted a wild Raichu and a wild Garchomp!-Free rein of the entire region, which you're free to explore in any particular orderSo yeah, there are definitely things on our wishlist that we wish that they would fix, or add into the game. I'm still hoping that we'll get to revisit the neighboring Kalos region and bring back Mega Evolution (there are quite a few Pokémon already in the games that could use the return of this mechanic), and cement the Paldea region as my favorite region. Knowing Game Freak now, they probably won't."
2023-06-10T10:16:01-0400,"Maybe this is an unpopular opinion, but I think that Megas were a great way to give Pokemon most players wouldn't otherwise give a second glance a chance for viability. Sure, some of them were overpowered, but I think that's part of the charm.It was also fun designing teams around a single Mega."
2023-06-10T12:40:35-0400,"As a Gallade fan, I think SV Gallade would be better than mega Gallade, as sharpness increases your power even further beyond what CC can offer"
2023-06-10T12:56:50-0400,The speed difference is a killer regardless of the power gain from Sharpness
2023-06-10T20:34:40-0400,"That requires an additional set-up turn on a Pokemon that does not take hits well, it's not a clean solution."
2023-06-10T20:47:29-0400,"Ok, equal, they both have their own ups and downsGallade-Mega has to rely on Zen Headbutt for psychic Stab, while regular Gallade uses 105 bp high crit psycho cut. If they give mega Gallade sharpness, it will truely outclass regular Gallade in my eyes"
2023-06-10T21:21:41-0400,"You know, gen 9 National Dex is a thing, you could go test this out empirically. At present, it looks like the Mega is winning, being in RUBL while the base form is in regular RU (note that Natdex doesn't have an official NU or lower, so the power gap may or may not be higher than it seems: Beautifly is also NDRU)"
2023-06-21T13:56:19-0400,"Clear Smog and Eruption are level up moves for Torkoal, not Egg moves. Flame Burst stopped existing back in Gen 8."
2023-06-23T18:22:06-0400,"Ok after all the official mons got leaked, there's one line that pretty much captured everyone's hearts.The tinkas! And ngl, I see why! They're pretty cute, they have a godlike type combination, they have decent performances on in game runs and competitive matches (not la creme de la creme or anything but still solid)and they're sociopaths!This is all well and good, tho for me personally, Imay or maynot prefer thebread dogs...For all tinka fan who aren't losing their minds rnYeah, basically I like the dachsbun line more than the tinkas. The reason for this is...well I'm not sure tbh. Maybe it's the combination of being more appealed to their designs (the tinka's hands have always been a little weird to me and fidough and dachsbun seem cuter in a way that I can't describe) and having used one to great success in my playthrough (lvl 18 play rough is still insane). Tho with that said I by no means think the tinkas are horrible. They're pretty cool, and I can see why people became obsessed with them! I just wanted to put my silly little personal preference out there.With that said, I still stand by my opinions I put earlier in the thread, dudunsparce is still not disappointing and the bugs still aren't that annoying! (If anything lake casseroya has gotten a little less laggier for me, tho that's probably just my system idk. That or I got too used to them to the point I don't notice idk...)"
2023-06-29T05:36:26-0400,"GameFreak should have waited until early 2023 to release these games. This would have given them time to fix the huge number of glitches and bugs in these games. Because the amount of glitches make the game feel rushed and unfinished, in my opinion."
2023-06-29T05:56:02-0400,"I'm not quite sure how this is unpopular, if anything that's what everyone thinks.Regardless, that's not a possibility. GF doesn't make the release dates.Any complaint about release schedule has to be directed toward TPCI or Nintendo (whichever makes them), and we pretty much widely aknowledged by now that ""pushing back the releases"" isn't something they are able to do short term, since it'd fuck up the schedule of literally everything else in the Pokemon Franchise.In order to take more time between releases, it'd probably need a very long term rescheduling of the pokemon franchise as a whole, something TPCI is definitely not willing to be bothered with."
2023-07-04T06:42:24-0400,"Thanks for the reply! Glad to hear my opinion is quite popular. :)It's a shame TPCi aren't willing to change the release schedule of the series. Since if the new games had an extra year development, we'd get a much better Pokemon game. Instead they seem to now choose quantity over quality, sadly. :("
2023-07-04T12:12:09-0400,"GameFreak is probably very involved in release date projections. TPC is literally made of a third board members, but even beyond that they're the developer and likely work in tandem with nintendo on projected release dates and issues.Likewise I think people overstate the series inability to make a 4 year plan instead of a 3 year plan. There's plenty of merchandise they can and likely would be able ot make, and if they had a sudden delay that also wouldn't matter because there's nothing stopping them from making merchandise of what has been revealed. Also likely why they don't hit the ground running with full merch of stuff that hadn't been revealed yet.If there's anything the end of last gen showed its that it doesn't matter if there was a delay. The TCG didn't launch until 2 or 3 months after the games came out, the ""SV Anime"" is (1) still not even ""really"" SV and (2) premiered 5 months into the generation. Things can be unmoored for a bit and adjust on the fly. Heck the anime has been flexible for a while in how it acknowledges mid-gen games too; DP only barely had a Platinum tie in, it threw a small chunk of episodes that could have been moved around for HGSS, ORAS was acknowledged mostly just through Megas and to an extent the new rival, BDSP was handled by just having more Sinnoh episodes (in this, the anime that just went everywhere in the pokeworld) and Legends Arceus was contained to a separate special that also didn't even actually advertise Legends Arceus. The little side materials (like Hisuian Snow) are web animes that can likely be held onto until they're ready to meet hte delay (or aired as a preview); if Nintendo can sit on games for over a year then TPC can sit on completed web animes that don't have any real merch to rely on until its game is actually out.And that's again just on the ""delay"" metric, the moment they lay out a 4 year plan this all becomes less of an ordeal.Point is: The Pokemon machine is overly complex, but I think if Gamefreak (the ones literally making the games) or Nintendo (the ones approving, producing and distributing the games) either needed more time up front or needed a sudden delay then TPC (literally just a marketing & merchandising arm that's made of 2/3rds GameFreak & Nintendo) would just have to deal with it. and it becomes significantly easier to deal with it when you're working on a projected 4 year schedule and not a 3 year schedule.Basically its probably more of a mutual problem. Perhaps one they've started thinking more about (DLC expansions likely takes less manpower and time than a ""proper"" third version, giving BDSP to ILCA is still an interesting move even if LA was meant as a similar time frame if nothing else), but still one they're all just going ""this is probably fine"" about."
2023-07-04T12:51:54-0400,"I mean when it all comes down to it, the games (despite any issues and complaints), sold amazingly as expected, and the other aspects of the franchise continue to truck along. I mean, has the perceived quality of S/V in particular made any actual affect on profits? As long as they keep bringing in the money, as it surely looks like for the foreseeable future, their mindset will surely be “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it”."
2023-07-04T12:53:56-0400,"Well yesn't.Having low quality games that ""still sell due to franchise"" is a risky path to walk, because it means that if you end up doing ""one mistake too much"" you will have much less chance of people to skip over it due to the quality.Obviously that doesn't exactly mean that either of the 3 parties cares, but there's a inherent risk of producing several low quality titles in a row, you risk breaking the rope"
2023-07-04T16:16:56-0400,"Alright, what I'm about to say is probably the EPIDEMY of unpopular opinions, and it might probably make everyone in the fandom flame me. But frankly, idc. This is what the thread is for after all.Despite all the technical goofs, scarlet and violet are, imo, still good games.Are they flawed? Oh absolutely. The bad performance, the confusing open world, the regional gimmick, the powercreep, all that jazz. However, I've always personally believed that the reactions have been a LITTLE overblown. Like, people just seem to overlook the positive aspects they provided all because of the graphics and all that. Which, fair enough, if graphics are a decisive factor for u then maybe these games aren't ur cup of tea. But it does frustrate me that it practically undermines the fun characters, ost, new mons and better in battle poses (at least better than before, u can't tell me ss leafeon looks more dynamic than sv leafeon. Not gen 5 sprite level of movement, but definitely an improvement), etc.Now, frankly, this probably contributes nothing to the conversation, unless the opinion of a conformist was needed and then again I already probably talked about these elsewhere. I just wanted to contribute my two cents to this. And again, it's ok if u don't like them, I'm not on some grand quest to make everyone like em, that'd be ridiculous.TLDR; I like SV despite all the glitches and stuff. Pls don't kill me for it..."
2023-07-07T09:45:43-0400,"Oh u know, people not knowing where exactly to go and thus ending up challenging gym leaders/titans/star bases they're either too underleveled or overleveled for. I had seen a lot of comments about that so I decided to mention it, tho I think I could've worded it better...Oh well"
2023-07-07T10:28:26-0400,You could ask for pointers in the Pokemon Centers tho.
2023-07-07T10:30:22-0400,"The Pokemon Centers literally just point to the nearest thing you haven't done yet.This is actually the crux of that specific ""problem"", because a bunch of people beat Brassius and then the Centers near by just say to try Mela."
2023-07-07T21:42:55-0400,Anyone else think that the gen 8 models look better than the gen 9 ones? I mean look at pult!
2023-07-07T22:30:54-0400,"The slightly jaggier tail doesnt bug me too much (I think I've seen it smooth out in game) but I do like SWSH's textures on the models more yeahThe trade off being I think the new ones react to lighting better, but SWSH's colors are quite vibrant across the board in a way that SV is not since it's going for a different aesthetic."
2023-09-06T09:48:38-0400,"Pokémon Black and White are average at best, and Scarlet and Violet are the best games in series."
2023-09-06T09:54:50-0400,"Thats because it likely is made out of shiny Revavroom, that has been worn by the desert winds, losing its shiny gold, making it look bronze"
2023-09-06T09:57:25-0400,Fracterra you know you can just edit your posts or queue up multiple quotes at once in the reply box right
2023-09-06T10:07:32-0400,"And GF has 169 employees compared to Nintendo’s, what,There were also people working on the dlc, and on the next Pokemon game.I did not know the second partWe love her because she is a sociopathAnd other notable open world games (Cough, Cough, Tears of the Kingdom) have much longer open endings, like, 2 and a half hour openings."
2023-09-14T02:02:01-0400,"GAMEFREAK should just do the right thing and disqualify everyone from worlds, I'm pretty sure that will solve all the problems"
2023-09-14T11:49:52-0400,"Forget the Championship, Gamefreak should cancel the world while we're at it."
2023-09-15T06:52:54-0400,"I mean I don’t think this is necessarily unpopular - if you break the rules you should be disqualified, its more people wanting the rule to be changed for the future."
2023-09-15T08:27:57-0400,"I dunno I saw a lot of people go they DIDNT deserve it because how can gamefreak expect people to make them legit when there's still so much cruft to work with.Which lord knows gamefreak still needs to alleviate various factors (the tera shards are only partially better after the DLC, the pokemon availability thing is still not resolved) but does seem to bury the whole ""cheating at a competition that doesnt want you cheating is playing with fire if they ever decide to crack down on cheating"" thingmy opinion is: if you're going to cheat. Kurt's run down of rental teams shows people aaaaabsolutely know they just don't care to hide it even though it's so easyAnd this applies to the idiots on GTS who couldn't hack a proper Legends pokemon to save their lives."
2023-09-15T13:16:11-0400,"It is definitely a controversial opinion at least. Some part of it is legitimate gripes about how hard it can be to get certain Pokémon. Others are less legitimate and quite frankly boil down to the fact that cheating is so normalized in the VGC community that the minute there's halfway decent enforcement people cry about how unfair it is they are punished for breaking rules they agreed to. Frankly Showdown doesn't help with how easy it is to just simply simulate a mon that may as well be impossible to get. Remember how much of a common option for Chansey and Blissey was Wish? A move that you could only get in Gen 3 from a specific event? In the actual games if you need a Wish Chansey/Blissey for your team, you have to either cheat one in or just suck it up and find something else to fill that role. On Showdown, it doesn't matter. Itbe legal therefore you can just put it in.It also doesn't help that the people who are much more vocal about the cheating problem have their own issues to put it lightly. Kurt is probably the best person saying how it's a problem, but given how he's the one who made the software used to gen in the first place it makes him less credible. Add in the drama chasers we won't mention here even though we all know who they are and bad arguments from the anti-cheating side which often devolve into ""cheating is wrong because cheating is wrong,"" it isn't surprising to see how it can be an unpopular opnion.Really the only way I see cheating going away is if there is physically no way to do it. As much as people say it gives no advantage, it clearly does or else so many people won't do it. It cuts down the time and effort needed to build a decent team so you can spend more time actually battling as well as giving you access to mons that are otherwise to impractical to get on your own. Even if they had something you could use to lower a Pokémon's IVs or otherwise modify them to give you anything you could possibly need, genning would still be faster as you don't need to gather those resources or even catch the Pokémon to begin with."
2023-09-15T13:53:54-0400,"Yeah there's never not going to be cheating, they could simplify it even more (and should, to be clear, there's really no reason for things like ability patches and HA to still be this level of annoying, PP Maxes should just be sold, tera shards should really only take 25 max and should honestly be something yo ucan freel yswap between once bought for that pokemon, IV lowering thing, the EV cleaner should have been base game and so forth) and it would still be there because unless it's literally a battle sim pokemon editor it's always going to be too much. And even if they had that you'll still have people who don't want to  bother and just want someone else to do it for them.Thus I say again: if you're going to cheat, cheatbecause a properly cheated Pokemon will be indistinguishable from a normal Pokemon. Or at least have differences so imperceptible that most people won't notice. Then we can just go back to the you know we know you know we know standoff and everyone can just keep cruising along.At least have a dedicated community cheater who hacks up on all the needed items or something."
2023-09-15T14:05:51-0400,"Ironically iirc that was the main reason for the bans: people who got banned had very poorly made mons that were super easy to scoop.There were a ton of genned mons as usual, and the properly made ones did not get punished.I do however moderately disagree with ""make everything easily accessible"". Sadly it does fight with what they want to do with the games, aka keep some pseudo-liveservice to keep people playing them even after beating them.I know how annoying it is to get ability patches and tera crystals, I hate it myself, but if they don't force you to grind / partecipate to raids, the games' online will be dead within a month outside of the actual VGC.They would need to change design model before they can allow ""easy access to competitive changing items"""
2023-09-15T14:17:49-0400,"Which is why I keep saying cheat better! Look at your better cheating peers!You can absolutely do both ""make things easily accessible"" and ""pseudo-live service""Like Ability Patches. You can make those a 5 or 10% drop easy and it would immediately be better while still needing you on The Grind25 tera shards still takes time especially if you want to keep swapping them across your teamThere's 0 reason you can't buy PP Maxes, it's just convenience. Honestly same for gold bottle caps too. The ones they sell at the auction house are just a scam compared to buying the bottle caps you need.Everything still costs money which you have to earnand so on."
2023-09-15T14:21:47-0400,"TBH a problem is you have people who claim that they absolutely don't cheat or offload responsibility by saying they have friends to ""catch"" them which creates a false impression for some people that cheating is less of a problem than it actually is. If you're actually involved, you know it's omni present. If you aren't, it's in people's best interest to keep it hidden because shockingly TPC might not be too happy when prominent VGC voices are telling people to break the rules or that they might do it themselves. This only makes it harder for people who are just getting in because they might not be aware that the reason they are too slow to adapt to meta trends or that they can't seem to get the exact right stats for their mons that everyone else seems to have is because they just genned them.On the one hand I can understand wanting to not have it so that everything is given to you with no challenge, but on the other hand reducing grinding is generally a good thing. To borrow a phrase, complaining about making the grind easier is like complaining about empty traffic. Besides, people will still do raids for other reasons. I mean not everyone goes into the game wanting to be some VGC champ."
2023-09-15T14:23:58-0400,calling nemona xenophobic or racist is dumb as hell. if i thought my town was becoming some tourist trap for people who didnt respect my culture id beat them with rocks. if they were spanish id beat them with hammers
2023-09-15T14:29:59-0400,"I assume you mean CarmineAlso I guess I shouldn't be surprised people feel that way about her. But even ignoring the valid feelings she's also, like, what. 17? 18 tops? Honestly probably even 16 but with a big ego. It's fine for her to be overprotective about the place you love (hm weird almost like this is a character flaw that applies to the rest of her life well anyway--).Especially when by the end she realizes she overreacted!It is very funny that the Caretaker is absolutely trying to turn it into a tourist trap though lmfao. he lets it slip in the post game"
2023-09-15T14:35:38-0400,"oooh im dumb as hell. id edit it but its funnier to let it uppokemon fans have this issue of constantly going grrr grrr why is there no mean rivals anymore, why is everyone so nice, but as soon as we get protags that have a bit of nuance theyre all bad people or something. with carmine its not as prevalent because she made a quick 180 but even then, having to see ppl say shes xenophobic or abusive to kieran (????????) over the most basic teenager characterization made me realize pokemon fans only want very shallow mean rivals and evil teams. which is kinda lame"
2023-09-16T10:17:01-0400,Yeah its silly I mean Blue/Silver/Gladion are some of the most popular (if not most popular - for me they are probs my top 3) rivals in the series. All 3 are generally dicks though Gladion gets some heavy backstory and character growth - Silver does too in the remakes. But yeah so mean rivals = good but then people complain - so stupid.I’m hoping Kieran is just a mean mean person in all of Part 2 (we already have his backstory ofc but I kinda hope he just treats us like trash)
2023-09-30T15:51:25-0400,"Getting rid of Scald was the greatest (competitive) choice that Scarlet and Violet made, and I'm honestly still really disappointed that they chose to bring it back.It is true that they limited Scald's distribution pretty drastically, and I like this approach with Toxic - it's a powerful defensive tool, but it's available to a few non-Poison types that have reasonable associations with poison. It's a much better approach than simply giving Toxic to literally everything! I will say, it is certainly an improvement over pre-Gen 9, where practically every single Water type could learn it. This is a concession I'll readily make - the state of Scald and its distribution isbetter than it used to be.For starters, I just think Scald is fundamentally an unbalanced move. A Water type move that can burn is just very difficult to deal with, because Water covers the one type that can safely switch into a burn move! Just from a flavor standpoint, I also dislike the idea of Water types being just as, if not more consistent, than Fire types at burning things. We also got Chilling Water just this gen, a much more balanced move that fulfilled a similar function to Scald without being as overtuned - lower BP and a weaker effect, but also a much moreone. I don't know if Chilling Water ever had widespread usage in any format, but I think it's still a much more reasonable power level than Scald, which was everywhere. Why introduce this move to begin with if you're just going to bring its superior version back with DLC? Matcha Gotcha is an even stronger move with the healing, but A. it's a signature move, meaning its distribution is nil and B. it's a Grass move, so you can switch in a Fire type with no concern.And among the 'mons that they chose to give the move, they still gave it to annoying bulky Waters! Nothing as bad as Toxapex, but even if Slowbro/king learn Flamethrower, I really don't think they should be able to click such a defensively powerful move. Alomomola also got enough of a buff with Flip Turn, if you ask me. If they had to keep Scald around, I genuinely do think it should be limited to Simipour and Volcanion only, both of whom naturally learn it and have the flavor to justify it. It'd also be fair game for any Fire/Water types to learn it, of course. I still believe in the glorious return of Bomushika!)"
2023-10-21T15:00:39-0400,"Friend Guard Evolite Clefairy is terrible for raids.Not because of stats or strategy, but because unenlightened internet randos will assume you're a troll and abandon the raid."
2023-10-24T13:02:20-0400,"Yeah, I like using that set, its very goodI disagree, I don’t like rivals who I want to commit unspecified acts of violence against because of how there head is stuck up their rear, ya get me? Bust I respect your opinion"
2023-10-24T20:09:02-0400,"Yes, that's why committing violence against them won't get you in trouble."
2023-10-30T10:57:27-0400,"Yeah, and I don’t have that kind of money, if that explains my reaction"
2023-12-23T23:47:53-0500,"Ok, I will say something controversial...I believe that SV is better than PLA, and I have 4 main reasonsMore new Pokemon to play with, discover, etcThe (imo) best rivals the series has ever hadArea Zero is goddamn beautifulCool new widespread moves"
2023-12-26T10:21:13-0500,I would agree SV is better than PLA for all those reasons.My unpopular opinion is that the DLC isn't really worthwhile and it's only redeeming feature is to give you a few more pokemon you wouldn't get otherwise.
2023-12-27T22:53:48-0500,"I know my opinion on the SV DLC isn't worth as much when I don't have it, but no Battle Facility makes it much worse than the SwSh DLC. Restricted Sparring is really fun and no Battle Facility is why I didn't get the SV DLC."
2024-03-29T05:27:56-0400,No increased Shiny Odds on the baby event is absolute bullshit *fume*
2024-03-31T00:37:47-0400,"As a Pichu fan who is not only a Pichu fan but would also appreciate a reason to hop on my Violet save again, I'll have to agree with thisLet's ignore the fact that unfortunately Pichu's Shiny just isn't that different from the original in these games anyway"
2024-03-31T16:08:29-0400,I think they should get rid of shinies entirely unless the player is actively hunting for them.  the joy of catching a random shiny is infinitely outweighed by the pain of failing one.

2015-09-17T22:07:36-0700,discussion something think would cool added Pokmon gamesI start asking think fusing Pokemon together get new PokmonNot like mixing designs two Pokmon together getting say Fire psychic type breeding two say Torchic Solosis make new Pokmon resemblances two allI think could take two Pokmon take someplace new game like near breeding house place two Pokmon receive fused Pokmon returnI base thought Zygarde forms information came recentlyIMO needs addition Fairy Steel Dark Poison Pokmon lists Perhaps Ice wellThis would generate new Pokmon new mechanic good possible combinations mix things bit could bring new Pokmon make use Pokmon dont really get much use many casesNot Fused Pokmon would huge powerhouse Pokmon base stats move sets could adjusted make competitive passiveWhat think
2015-09-18T03:30:34-0700,Bring Would breath fresh air somewhat stagnating game series Dont get wrong still love games new iteration find less less exciting new content might also interesting able breed andor fuse prime pokemon
2015-09-18T11:41:08-0700,would awesome get say example IceFire type fusion result Perhaps taking Normal types fusing singletype Fire even though Pyroar NormalFire along small handful others Normal could expand typing give boost variety battle sceneAbilities could expanded well fused Pokmon could take one abilities Original two Pokmon could new ability could ability result fusion processPrimal Fusion sounds great dont get wrong want see powerhouse legends Perhaps fuse say Primal Groudon compatible fuseing Pokmon result would minimix version legend adds second typing like ElectricGround Alhough would sorta cool see Rayquaza Groudon blend
2015-09-18T16:40:15-0700,thinking idea could cross breed pokemon stats typing like bred pidgeot zapdos could get pidgey lightning attack becomes part electric

2014-07-10T13:18:47-0700,Heard mega Metagross confirmed Dont know source hope since really like pokemon
2014-07-10T18:09:49-0700,confirmed Coro Coro leaks Im excited Metagross always favorite mine mega form sweet dont particularly care design mostly looks pretty lazy part flipping legs giving pointy goatee eh dont use Pokemon looks good isOne source says mega ability Tough Clawskinda hoping honestly Ok makes sense given mega form pic makes fearsome sweeper especially since cant intimidated start really wants needs Levitate especially since gained 2 weaknesses whole Steel type nerf gen subtracting 1 least
2014-07-10T20:40:18-0700,design looks scary sure pokemon dont need boost getting megas Since Metagross getting one pretty much assume Mightyna getting one also hope Zangoose gets one needs boost
2014-07-12T13:06:46-0700,Megas Garchomp Scizor says hi though kind moot since theyre rarely used base form anyways
2014-07-12T16:37:03-0700,look forwards Garchomp evolves base 102 speed drops 80 get free kill Zapdos Scizor always free kill even opponent didnt play understand GEN 4 5 metaOn side note Expert Belt Zapdos working really well
2014-07-13T00:12:15-0700,wellOne thing said pokemon mega evolver look numbers is718 pokemon18 typesthe total number pokemon typethe number dual type per 18 single typesthe number noneligible VGC pokemonthe number base stat battle worthy pokemon really used VGCthe move sets available said VGC worthy pokemonabilities actually worth using VGCthe hold items worth using VGCand number pokemon go megasomething need happen raise number actual pokemon participate VGC pokemon dont fit VGC scene criteria level considered battle worthy going see change metajust example real numbers tossed factual referencelets say 700 pokemon rounding simplicityof 700 say 200 able participate legendary500300 pokemon low base stats pointless abilities real use VGC based upon competitive level VGC requires able stand chance competition level20050 mega evolve 25 actually worth VGC battles17550 bad dual typing horrible move pools makes able stand chance due one many weaknesses yet decent base stats try compete frail battle compared remaining pool battle worthy pokemon12550 pokemon takes compete yet fail pair nicely pokemon make strategy worth trying use VGC75your looking perhaps 75 battle worthy pokemon pokemon determin meta game goessomething giving pokemon megavolution needing done game state VGC IMO stalelets hope new games pokemon get better base stats better abilities open VGC scene better playing state getting megas higher pool number draw better battle strategieseditI personally would love see number least 400 700 able battle worthy sake mixing strategy options break metas current state future VGC scene way little room seeing pokemon used list coming yearSure pokemon work well getting game story mode makes possible beat gym leaders getting around catching breedingbut seems rather saddening many pokemon make VGC worthy higher base stated pokies abilities make option battles level
2014-07-13T15:13:40-0700,Thats point weaker pokemon getting Megas useable Mawile use randomly gets Mega though think thats due getting new typing Pokemon got Megas really need Im hoping unique Pokemon get time around Would love see Mega Zangoose seeing Mega Metagross saddens bit know powercreep grow stronger
2014-07-13T17:25:06-0700,Well honest dont know Metagross stats affected getting mega may necessarily blessing guess moment
2014-07-13T20:07:20-0700,Based art tell attack stat going Based 135 like maybe 160ish assume getting weaker sure mega may see special stat drop dual 4x weakness may change darkmetal psychicdark
2014-07-14T04:44:48-0700,wont debate may indeed right Hey knows guess point may valid invalid anyone else fact rather hope right However point game arrives theres remote possibility might get surprised reason wouldnt start counting chickens yet could make fantastic claims right one would wiser release day Thats say subjectIts nice find bit Super secret bases like fact make mini gym people battle hope lot friends instead collector dolls However
2014-07-14T09:57:44-0700,Super secret base sounds fun One thing hope returns letting lead Pokemon walk around much needed change small things make game fell life like Also would nice dungeon crawling mode find items Pokemon Would cool mini game
2014-07-17T16:03:37-0700,Theres since information Metagross going get big buff Speed Im guessing bumping typical 100 rest stats also going buffed well getting Touch Claws new ability additionally source also said Mega Diancie going lose defenses pick lot speed attack statsIn regards Megas Im excited Mega Metagross Swampert bulky begin good movepools typing Im sold Mega Sableye Mega Sceptile yet Sableye losing prankster pretty big deal promises become bulkier Im convinced going enough make worthwhile Sceptiles problem hand always movepool focusing physical attacks stats emphasize Special Im expecting Sceptile pick Dragon Pulse unless gets something thatll leave 4 types special attacks including Hidden Power ability nice doesnt cover major weaknesses typing gives
2014-07-17T17:09:09-0700,Sceptile already learns Dragon Pulse right could sworn came across DP Giga Drain Hidden Power Fire maybe Focus Blast would work well Lightning Rod may get faster wait see gets anything elseWhere mega pidgeot though Thats really want
2014-07-17T19:34:07-0700,Yes notice news Metagross Good see since used Deoxys Rayquaza Swampert Kyogre lot playing original Sapphire game Hopefully theyll give Rayquaza mega well case good find vaporeons suspicions confirmed Im really looking forward ORASLOL side note show whats going house son Josh 25 year take EB Games preorder games assumed planning preordering one asked one wanted says course Get Dad Apparently really loved pokemon set games wants play come time Thats first us since usually gets one game get guess Ill buy Na na na Take annoying youngster
2014-07-17T19:45:51-0700,Dragon Pulse currently move tutor move gen 5 sad say unless give Dragon Pulse itll stuck Dragonbreath theyve throwing Dragon Pulse around lot XY itll probably get anyway Even 4 moves arent enough sell attacker especially Dragon little coverage blocked Fairies
2014-07-17T20:45:31-0700,Yeah 2 stab good enough mega though since hard switch Even got lightning rod boost would need good fairy counter move though still Black 2 game able get Dragon Pulse mine know tutor move thought egg move Thanks letting know
2014-08-13T16:45:03-0700,megas coming many announced farMetagrossAudinoSlowbroSalamenceLopunnyAltariaDiancieMawileSableyeSwampertSceptileI guess Kyogre Groudon arent really considered megas going see changes wellAny others Im forgetting
2014-08-19T16:31:04-0700,Mega Mawile already outI think going getting Mega Slaking many prerelease shots tended include Megas starters exception E4 Shiftry Dusknoir Slaking screenshots Mega Slowbro
2014-09-01T15:40:23-0700,MEGA MR MIMElol nah perhaps Mega UnownI think Pokmon getting Mega treatments helping balance games bit adding Fairy types IMO good movenow new 201415 VGC format gets announced well see balance goes favor
2014-09-06T20:24:18-0700,recent bit Pokemon Get TV apparently revealed moves used Primal Groudon Primal Kyogre new moves However effects names revealed reminds though dont know abilities yet
2014-09-09T13:00:32-0700,think maybe theyre calling new forms Groundon Kyogre Primal means maybe therell return Primal Dialga Sinnoh region think battle music anybody played MD2 beaten know Im talking Plus Primal Giratina would look amazing Primal Palkia might actually get typing makes sense Maybe new type Mystery Cosmic would definitly give pokemon like Deoxys Unknown something unique Deoxys phychic anyway Shouldnt ElectricPhychic instead plain Phychic Cause would make lot sense Speaking Primal form Deoxys much Probably
2014-09-10T04:21:26-0700,Primal Deoxys Yummm Doubt definitely nice dream rest guess wont know til later
2014-09-10T14:06:28-0700,new Corocoro leaking means getting names attacksalthough Kyogres still hasnt leaked yetPrimal Groudon gets Land Endings ability attack Cliff SwordPrimal Kyogre gets Sea Beginnings attack stated leaked yetThese abilities summon strong sun strong rain probably meaning infinite maybe effectsAlso 3 Megas leaked Gallade info Mega Sharpedo Strong Jaw Mega Camerupt Kinda sad see Wallys staple Pokemon gonna Gallade Gardey guess Diantha already stole thunder
2014-09-11T09:48:10-0700,even sadder think Dianthas isnt really good Id say going make bosss pokemon decent make bit challenge
2014-09-12T20:22:27-0700,Heck give gym leaders pokies mega evolve double battle make bit challenge
2014-09-13T07:26:24-0700,dont make players gym leaders Sure would complicated incredibly fun challenging
2014-09-15T04:43:46-0700,Smeargle1 explain mean cant figure would done taking opponent played advancing pokemon giving devastating attacks problem sometimes older learned attack sometimes effective example trick room would choose players become gym leaders second thought maybe make separate thread dont think would really fit one
2014-09-16T18:00:46-0700,guess Smeargle saying would awesome players could upload team system another player would able download team game gym battleThe hidden bases sort setup like gym friends battle guessing gym fashionI think would awesome way upgrade gym leaders gym downloads Say play game get badges defeat E4 would able download upgrade gyms Different Pokmon course higher levels time go E4 would successor come new championIn way would even better like say 16 people online wifi battles earn badge wifi gym could like 10 different teams disposal challenged battles different every time rematch lost match everyone challenges face team Personally like idea highly doubt something manner would happen wifi opens many ideas Pokmon games could interactive options trading battles like could Pokmon universe mode virtual world region set like XDGoD union area players sorts things
2014-10-02T18:45:33-0700,Oh thats Im talkin Mega Rayquaza Man love pokemon design great upgrade makes even better definitely cant wait used enough post Na dont think Heres
2014-10-02T20:09:39-0700,know ability would make bird team OP bad Ill likely chance use competitively
2014-10-04T14:21:36-0700,well might possible youll able use ability Vaporeon 1415 format yet announcedI think format say think ORAS Pokedex combined XY Pokedex restriction legendries list normal duplicate Pokmon duplicate hold item Like youll able ONE legendary party ban Pokmon like Celebi ban legendary ORASXY least could say format would doI think Staraptor would pair awesome new quazza perhaps Talonflame would awesome well
2014-10-04T15:11:52-0700,Well would Pidgeot Im also thinking might allow 1 uber legendary well would use mega rayquaza want know move works dont know removes weakness flying types makes immune rock lightning ice attack flying typing thats case make team abuse ability
2014-10-04T16:07:54-0700,Well understanding move removes current weather status prevents weather changes come activated keeps Flying type Pokmon taking weakness damage attacks normal damageThe Flying types definitely get great boost use sure quazza allowed many good Flying Pokmon get chance VGC scene Charizard see even use paired quazzaWhat meant 1 legendary used Celebi banned saying Celebi Mew Jirachi sort banned youll able use mascot legends
2014-10-04T20:38:19-0700,Okay see really dislike selective rules like ability say articuno would still take weakness damage ice type would stone edge deal 2x damage instead 4x Also hope get rid native rule
2014-10-05T18:13:07-0700,Im also looking forward see mega evolution Rayquaza looks shiny Rayquaza well

2013-11-04T09:42:45-0800,Sup guys Im sure lot people may may competitive team least still testing Im sure teams least one Mega Evolving Pokemon midst certainly wanted make thread others say Megas competitive standpoint know Mewtwo arguably strongest lol lets real talk majorityJust way Ill write short statements certain Megas eye onMega Mawile Mawile went one forgettable Pokemon tiny mighty competitive Pokemon Mega Evolution gives much needed stat boosts Huge Power sweet candy good physical movepoolMega Kangaskhan one worth mentioning mainly Ability Parental Bond allows certain attacks hit twice second attack understanding deals less damage first also came realize moves like Rock Tomb PowerUp Punch also dish double stat changes Powerup Punch essentially giving builtin SDance etc etc sure itll mean much competitively something Im keeping eye onMega Manectric Yet another underwhelming Pokemon made better design bit umm punkish Speed SpAtk skyrocket hefty 135 also gains Intimidate cases comes handy good special attacker many ways movepool shallow need moves wreck shop Moves like Volt Switch Thunder HP Ice Flamethrower part repertoire course standard ThunderboltNow enough perspective Lets hear guys say
2013-11-04T16:37:45-0800,May add ways counter mega threat use megas team
2013-11-04T17:15:41-0800,think Mega Pokemon need banned competitive play tend overpowered Reasons Mega Evolving cost anything use recharge cool time Mega Evolve attack changes stats also change turn counter works decrease increase speed base stat Pokemon losing bad typing kept broken top Pokemon Mega Stones dont need hold items begin benefit Mega Stone gaining power losing bad typing cool competitve play need banned reason Lati Twins cant hold Soul Dew rumor even Lati Twins getting Mega forms
2013-11-04T17:43:04-0800,Mega Ampharos improved imo several reasonsMold Breaker cancels several useful abilities contains Protean Sturdy Natural Cure Technician Harvest Magic Guard Speed Boost Huge Power Contrary Parental Bond Shadow Tag etcElectricDragon gained resistance happens 4x Electric Fire Grass WaterBuffed Satk along better Def SdefCan thrown Trick Room TeamThe negatives areHe gained weaknesses Ice Dragon FairySlowRequires Pokemon support Ampharos make effectiveShallow movepoolOverall Ampharos one Pokemon tons unique properties impractical several situations terms Pokemon going natural base stats wont see often better Mega Pokemon use Mega Stone cant use second one remainder battle However player encounter Ampharos use elements surprise advantage play cards right
2013-11-05T13:59:45-0800,agree many overpowered honest needed boost Manectric Houndoom Mawile Medicham lot Pokmon seem weak compared Pokmon labeled overpowered Garchomp Gengar even XY think lot Pokmon received Megas needed competitive merit Plus aint much chance Mega Evos banned mean yeah theyre strong banned since trigger one Mega per battle would hold anyone back using many isnt autowin use one
2013-11-11T12:08:37-0800,think relative strength bit misleadinglets consider Mega Heracross example big 185 Atk scary reality Gutsboosted Heracross actually hit harder mention mega form slower also gains completely different ability Skill Link forcing run completely different moves really want take advantage Garchomp loses speed well Mega evolve Garchomps speed tier 102 extremely useful outspeeding base 100s turns bit sitting duck Pokemon like Hydreigon KO Draco Meteor would otherwise outsped Mega Gyarados gains Dark loses Flying type smacked around easily Fighting attacks used laugh Manetricwell Manetric still pretty useless making faster harder hitting Jolteon Intimidate doesnt really muchI guess bottom line give something use mega form cases like Mega Mawile Kangeshkan clearly superior really gain lot mega evolving compared normal forms Otherwise cases basically akin putting Life Orb damage recoil maybe speed boost adding bulkiness cost speed Consider also hold mega stone losing potentially valuable items like Leftovers Choice Scarf Sitrus Berry typereducing berry etc powerful used right dont really see gamebreaking really
2013-11-17T04:16:13-0800,Yeah noticed mega Ampharos isnt good Perhaps might one Im impressed compared ones games Im looking forward able port pokemon near end year Maybe make better competitive pokemon previous versions
2013-11-17T07:47:43-0800,quick question use mawile scizor team attach mega stone
2013-11-17T15:57:48-0800,Kinda depends team really basic general statement Mawile prefers TRoriented teams Scizor usually function well thanks typing Bullet Punch needs usually SD belt start wrecking things BP Bug Bite
2013-11-17T16:07:11-0800,Ummm yeah realize Im little slow could please repeat english LOLPlease define following TRoriented teams SD belt BPThanks
2013-11-17T21:09:55-0800,Lol problemBP Bullet PunchTR Trick RoomSD Swords DanceSo basically Mawile works best Trick Room since speed bad lacks priority moves Trick Room reverses speed becomes one faster Pokemon 5 turns Scizor despite ok Speed doesnt need Trick Room since strong priority move Bullet Punch lets attack first regardless Combined Swords Dance boost attack wrecks havoc Pokemon dont resist moves
2013-11-18T17:17:48-0800,Mawile gets Sucker Punch learned hard way Took Floatzel Zangoose one hit 50 percent Zapdos
2013-11-18T19:04:50-0800,Well wit Megas around hope format become stale repetitious meta Megas think problems heavily considering Pokemon playable course restriction systemSay team 6 bring 6 pick 4no duplicate hold itemsno duplicate Pokmon1 legendry1 mega stone hold item onlyjust thought
2013-11-18T20:43:19-0800,Alright next question slightly topic really whats best way raise Scyther great Scizor use mega stone think might better without Im also thinking natures characteristics movesets happen know find best pokemon raise effort values also access Pokemon Black Black 2 helpIve always liked Scizor Volcarona inclusions teams Hopefully one really useful format
2013-11-18T22:04:59-0800,Duh good point forget thatfor reason given large flytrap Crunch comes mind beforehand lolHonest answer Breed raise Scizor one BlackWhite 2 carts get Bug Bite Move Tutor Without youre stuck XScissor isnt boosted Technician Adamant way go Nature probably looking something like Swords DanceBullet PunchBug BiteProtect moveset least doubles singles drop Protect something like Pursuit another utility attack whenever Pokebank comes next month transfer Volcarona still pretty useful Quiver Dance typing still powerhouse watch Rock attacks
2013-11-19T08:06:02-0800,Since speed wont really issue Macho Brace training Scizor
2013-11-20T06:30:35-0800,assuming X maybe super training reset bag think called dont worry EVs latter get perfect
2013-11-21T12:46:07-0800,IMO Scizor plenty fine without Mega youre probably better using another Mega saying Mega Scizor bad Scizor already good might well invest Mega something really change game
2013-11-24T13:28:17-0800,Ok good comment feel opinion valid one mega opinion worth change game
2013-11-24T13:50:49-0800,like Mega Kangakhan seems well school next Mega Mawile OP set seems PowerUp Punch EarthquakeReturn Sucker Punch Fake
2013-11-26T00:46:54-0800,really sure quite yet Im starting toy around teams Mega Kangaskahn Mega Mawile seem pretty good previously stated Mega Banette getting Prankster Wisp also interesting Mega Gyrados also pretty interesting becomes bulky still retains enough speed use Dragon Dance great effect really depends team support otherAs much loathe redundancy Singles Mega Abomasnow Mega Tyranitar could pretty brutal Doubles IMO able reactivate abilities Mega Charizards Drought Mega Abomasnow becoming even slower certainly frightening TR
2013-12-18T02:58:39-0800,find Mega Gyrados interestingbypassing Rotoms Levitate EQ Aromatisse Aroma Veil wants taunt 100 later someone tested confirm would great Im 8090 sure Plus gets rid nasty horrific x4 weakness Electric Mega Kang Mega Mawile suited goodstuffs teams pretty versatile think Mega Banette Prankster Taunt niche function well TR team eats Mega evo game suggested moveset would something like WillOWispTauntKnockOffSucker Punch Protect Shadow Claw Mega Charizard alot powerful sun expected havent seen many action
2013-12-18T06:57:33-0800,problem MGyarados give lot made Gyarados good Resistance Grass Fighting immunity Ground Megaevolve suddenly Mach Punch lot threatening Plus weakness Fairy Additionally Gyarados huge variety items benefits Lum Berry Sitrus Berry Life Orb Leftovers Shell Bell gone want MegaFor comparisonGyaradosWeaknesses 2Resistances 5Immunities 1MGyaradosWeaknessesResistances 6Immunities 1Not saying doesnt uses Mold Breaker undeniably good ability requires LOT careful playingscouting threats

2013-08-08T11:07:47-0700,Im loving designs Im HATING whole Mega Evolution thing feels Digimonish tastes
2013-08-08T11:08:01-0700,Lucario much win looks epic Adaptability broken Lucario especially since Fighting strong type already plus Fairytypes might weak Steel FoxMaster51 approves thumbBlazikens color scheme pretty cool sure like design though least Speed Boost accessibleAbsol looks cool guess Certainly feminine Magic Bounce good Ability like Mega AbsolMega Mawile say woahMega Mewtwo Seen Could better Ability Although first Legendary evolveMega Ampharos becomes Dragon type worst time really Ampharos couldnt get awesome design like restIt seems like theyre trying turn Pokemon pseudo Legendaries make Ninetales Megaevo better screw
2013-08-08T11:28:28-0700,dont like mega Pokemon thing chance fix game Please dont let mess
2013-08-08T11:32:44-0700,actually really like part designs pretty cool save Ampharos kinda Absol like idea pseudo Stage3 PokemonIm also excited see implemented TCG totally see Lv Xs making comeback seems perfect guys
2013-08-08T11:37:18-0700,vaporeon dont want Mega ex Pokemon 300 HP attacks 200 damage 1 energy mention also come deck immediately opening basic abilities let discard hand draw many times want
2013-08-08T11:47:04-0700,guys probably new EXLevel Xex XY TCG series Wonder implemented
2013-08-08T13:01:48-0700,remember Mega Digimon werent last stage Digivolution could also DNA digivolve fuse 2 digimon together Cant wait MegaBlaziken MegaMetagross DNA digivolve MegaMetaBlaziGrossIkenMon
2013-08-08T13:08:56-0700,Youll probably sacrifice 3 Mewtwos summon Mega Mewtwo Unless opponent plays defusion trap card original Nintendo nonono
2013-08-08T14:18:43-0700,Oh man used word Mega must digimon ripoff thisthread
2013-08-08T14:29:16-0700,totally agree could really neat way rebalance spice series since common complaint battle system hasnt changed enough could kind see equivalent special attacks RPGs ie Limits FF7 obviously handled differently since looks things theyll probably temporaryAlso one gets reminded Iriss design BW2 look Mega Mawile
2013-08-08T14:32:14-0700,temporary transformation thing dont like sort thing meaningful impact going main point battles couple ways could go though hopefully could permanent thing possibly reversible possibly new Mega pokmon different powerful similar Formes work eg Therians could mechanic meant completely new type battle like triple battles like giant battles Mario Luigi series Maybe something similar Conquest Rumble could exactly fear except ingame thing like Latios Latias banned theyre holding Soul Dew allowed without could let unleash Mega Blaziken Elite 4 let bring othersEither way hate name Mega doesnt mean big strong means million megablaziken sounds like joke way measure heat star Wow warm Four megablazikens pokmonI like designs far though
2013-08-08T14:32:27-0700,make pokemon different thats degimon Pokemon suppose organic creatures evolve exist Digimon data change need making pokemon means pokemon becoming digimon Also sounds like power creep worst game
2013-08-08T14:36:17-0700,People dislike thisThese Pokemon look absolutely amazing Im stoked already MegaMawile best thing ever
2013-08-08T15:24:10-0700,totally make Pokemon call Tron
2013-08-08T15:50:56-0700,really REALLY doubt called Mega English localization probably sounds fine Japanese English expect something different although Im blanking potential alternatives
2013-08-08T16:11:40-0700,DNA Digivolved guys still Mega level stronger Mega unDNAd Megas Remember even Mega level Digimon still stronger weaker others Ultimate MagnaAngemon stronger several Megas came across
2013-08-08T17:02:43-0700,Exactly like Digimon multiple branched evolutions makes sense much Pokmon see moreIve never fan Pokmon formes reversible probably wont like reversible generic prefix creatures Mega Evolution mechanicI really like designs though Mega Blaziken Mega Lucario look sickRumor referred Awakened stomach much better Mega Sort like awakening ultimate potentialpowerwhatever
2013-08-08T22:29:16-0700,Id liked Pokemon werent good begin Mawile good choice instance got given would give chance Pokemon like Beedrill dont chance become useful new evolution ability get stronger form Pokemon like Lucario Blaziken getting cheapens little IMO Though like MegaMewtwo seems specifically designed Darkrai counter lolAs comparisons Digimon different forme differences Theyre freely changeable ability Pokemon change forme almost always occured games debut actually seems logical forme changes sudden burst power makes change form cant sustain power temporary like certain kinds energy couldnt make Pokemon change shape power anyway Evolution stones come mind temporary doesnt make difference meFrom balance standpoint still know next nothing Though know one thing basically sacrifice holding item ability use Mega p dont think break anything
2013-08-08T23:30:37-0700,something incorrect apparentlyStill dont like name
2013-08-09T00:04:21-0700,according clarified information looks like forms show battles temporary even within battle words basically iteminduced super form works relatively short time battleEven Ive misinterpreted info bit one thing sure forms temporary happen battles
2013-08-09T01:03:03-0700,shouldnt problem unless decide make couple broken ones could totally see going overboard Mega Rampardos something
2013-08-09T01:58:23-0700,love designs especially Lucarios Blazikens enjoy gave Absol angel wingAdaptability Lucario amazing
2013-08-09T10:10:11-0700,think evolve battle thing could another general evolution method Like certain Pokemon need certain move evolve night case seems like bring Mega Stone battle Mega Evolves dont see much evidence saying temporary Im hanging back waiting info
2013-08-09T10:39:33-0700,Reread statement answer make point adifferencedoesnt make adifferenceto youre honest situationYou also started assumption assumption wise one make us dont care formes dont mind like dislike ones easily reversed neither opposed formes want make sense gameplay setting perspectiveNow consider also much copying one Pokmons major rivals Digimon due part implemented definitely named Finally consider us dissatisfied combat mechanics Pokmon arent going solve anything old thing new gimmick added wont advance combat wont balance old issues best hope isnotcreating new problems
2013-08-09T15:00:03-0700,pretty interesting since Mega forms used battle require use hold item Mega pokemon cannot Choice items Life Orb Leftovers et alSo choice hold item Mega formNothings original Quit parroting crap copying digimon copying one zillion things beings sort become biggerflashier get stronger example easily say Digimon Pokemon heavily ripping Dragonball Z using exact argument

2013-09-25T12:13:01-0700,Preface Sorry already discussedSoI read XY opening cinematic 3D mention since game isnt stereoscopic 3DDoes mean game 3D assumption WHOLE game 3D certain parts understanding correctlythanksken

2013-09-30T08:35:18-0700,Rumors Info leaks Nothing last post confirmed frankly Id surprised werekeniselvis Yes game 3D stated interview putting 3D overworld would meant couldnt put much detail world opted thought looked better
2013-09-30T12:39:38-0700,mean mean walking around 3D battles areAny ideas could read interviewMy son says pokemon rumble blast 3D pretty detailedsidebar probably care little much picked pikachu 3DS anticipation XY
2013-09-30T15:47:51-0700,3D would guess depend environment area Sort like BWBW2 bridge sort 3D graphics restricted change 45 degree topdown view battles would nice see 3D way think still nice see topdown views like going Pokmon Center buildingsWell wait see 3D toggled
2013-09-30T15:50:18-0700,really matter things 3D arent new Pokemon game Itll look fantastic even without 3D guess overworld well probably less noticeable 3D effect battle sequences
2013-10-02T08:54:06-0700,finally decided make Dragon FireDragon actually good type combo since Fire cancels Dragons Fairy weakness said Tough Claws increases power physical moves likely glorified version Huge Power Plus Attack goes upon MEvolving meaning Tough Claws Attack boost Charizard becomes physical powerhouse moves like Flare Blitz Dragon Claw even Outrage course Charizard Drought also appealingAlso makes wonder Venusaur Blastoise another MEvolution
2013-10-02T14:45:32-0700,Something keep mind 3D thing two things 3D refer stereoscopic 3D thats 3DSs trademark accessed using slider side 3D models backgrounds Pretty much entire game 3D models weve seen wonderfully detailed opinion look great However every item screen put stereoscopic 3D system create twice every single blade grass drawn twice every single tree stump drawn twice takes LOT power 3DS Particularly still wanted play high framerate smooth animations would drain battery like nothing else Saving stereoscopic 3D areas less things makes life simpler

2013-08-18T22:44:22-0700,Exactly one week birthdayNow get 3DS
2013-08-09T11:05:31-0700,PokebeachThis pretty cool cool game makes easier wish game made IV Individual Value breeding easier Seems like takes much longer breed right IVs battle right EVsWhat would awesome speculation would XY removed IVs used Base Stats EVs would perfect
2013-08-09T11:30:34-0700,hadnt seen official web site credited saw information
2013-08-09T11:54:08-0700,interesting meCould Super Training EVs Core Training IVs
2013-08-09T12:32:36-0700,wish Pokemon would stop treating EVs bases stats completely different things great tool good ev training nothing help pokemon need boost compete looks like system stay
2013-08-09T20:54:50-0700,Im surprised theyve officially recognized base statsI dunno half almost thinks way boosting IVs rather EVs text bit vague
2013-08-10T01:09:14-0700,would rather way boost IVs EVs think itI EV training forever breeding IVs long EV train sleep breedingI think since many things favor EV training time IVs get boost newest addition training aspect competitive play
2013-08-10T05:59:22-0700,Im pretty certain terms Base Stat Effort Value Intrinsic Value fanmade names stuck doubt internal names TPC GF uses values know internally call EV always called Base Stat always different term call Base Stat
2013-08-10T12:08:30-0700,Well word core could call base stats IVs flexible range maxmin stat inside base stats EVs additional boosts increase base statsTo understand Pokmon share common equal value meaning common shared equality Pokmon comparison base stats Two Charizards share core stats nature case IVs 31 0 equal coreThis keeps Pokmon different unique unless basecore stats exactly mannersWhat would like see change IVs get dropped factor allow nature characteristics deciding factor makes Pokmon unique things would need considered example two Pokmon Speed stat IV EV Nature would determine Pokmon attacks first battleThe games already randomly select Pokmon goes first Speed order tie stats totaled exactly alternates two round battle attack firstIf way increase IV training IV stats things satisfied general player base regards competitive sceneLess need RNG hackingMore level battle field players chances getting best performance Pokmon battlesNot many battles determined winner based low verse high IVs battles already factors critical hits luck status inflictions abilities hold items type coverage lack move setsIn way sort stinks lose battle based IVs contributing deterring Pokmon able serve purpose strategy would rather lose battle critical hit instead IV stat main matter giving opponent winEVs supposed give advantage stat waste invest EVs Pokmon mediocre IVs counter productive IMO advantage pays Pokmon facing EVd share Nature
2013-08-10T12:13:36-0700,thinking Creatures recognize Effort Values named game thing EffortoMetor super confusing
2013-08-10T22:11:17-0700,think IVs make game complicated complicated sake needed game Base Stats battle train Pokemon system Leave complicated part breeding right moves onto getting right ability choosing right item equip
2013-08-10T22:47:10-0700,agree would like see stats work differently want system Pokemon used competitively train stats past limit matter system choose use Pokemon strength always others outclass others make system train Pokemon stats much like people use favorites Pokemon
2013-08-11T13:50:53-0700,situation players would care ability moves pokemon learn Shedinja becomes godlike ability able escape lower stats
2013-08-11T14:24:20-0700,would need balance Shedinja would still 1 HP need something give Pokemon competitive chance edge seems gen nothing would change yet still dont know else plan though wish would tell us
2013-08-11T14:29:31-0700,get certain Pokemon dont see light day arent good enough Maybe Pokemon Company needs institute Modified Formatesque list certain Pokemon used season events changes every season 500 Pokemon dont think limiting amount playable Pokemon would remove many options
2013-08-11T14:35:45-0700,rebalance base stats Pokemon TPC know meta involved make list Pokemon used normally left community make sure Pokemon used competitively easily done either giving 80 120 base stat boost weaker stage 2 pokemon like 60 Pokemon dont evolve give hold item boost statsWith Mega Pokemon shown us confirmed thinking dont plan change base stats Unbalance base stats problem games
2013-08-11T16:07:28-0700,disagree every Pokemon needs competitive cant think game every character competitive Street Fighter miniature games system every piece competitive truth matter good characters must bad charactersEven boost weaker Pokemon players going concentrate tip top best Pokemon still Pokemon cant competitive many Pokemon offer exact base stats better ability type attack skill set
2013-08-11T17:26:39-0700,video games story mode need lower tier Pokemon given Ever battle gym leader uber hisher party first 5 badges get E4 youll find better tier Pokemon higher base statsTheir degree balance tiers Pokemon use progress game IMO better balance competitive scene comparison story mode casual playersTypes dual type combo Pokemon competative little offer higher tier base stats type Casual anything goes getting gameCompetitive vs casual tiers casual easier bring higher leveled Pokemon earn badge Competitive base stats matter restricted specific tier remain competitiveComp vs casual Numbers per type competitive base stats classed abilities move pool requires training casual open range long hgher levelBoosting numbers add upgrade base stats among Types dual types give competitive players larger tier bring better balance available stratagiesCasual play estimate really needs 225 total Pokemon get game provide variety battles face story mode guess say remaing 500 PokemonLower medium tier Pokemon basically see reach E4 small number 79 ish top tier OU Pokemon 57 levels higher starting party ie level 6570ishor pulling Lance things like battle Subway restrict usable boost base stats mid tier NURU Pokemon OU status instead adding another evolution hold itemBreak RU boost base stats
2013-08-11T21:56:40-0700,always liked Evolite item BlackWhite helped nonfully evolved Pokemon tougherPerhaps could items boost certain stat stats really lowSo item boosts Speed DefSpDef really low boost HP AtkSpAtk really low could put older Pokemon may competitive

2013-07-11T19:13:26-0700,like like frankly statement sounds backwardsA living GhostSteel sword exciting Golurk could even seem rather novel Pokmon wielding sword Pokmon sword mean thats Pokmon Tool territory take Machoke give swordAgain though like like complaint isnt making much sense
2013-07-11T20:29:08-0700,dunno short list likes without knowing stats Yveltal Pancham Noivern Honedgebut info outI think prefer Xerneas Yveltal probably enough powerful Darktypes Go Fairy would good counter Dragon LegendariesPancham evolves another toughlooking bear akin Ursaring Beartic EhNoivern Dont know much yetHonedge hand like seems hit miss people hit biggrin hope good stats redeemable attributes make playableHonorable mention Talonflame name cool like superhero something bird looks cool bad going average However indeed starting bird could see using Fly assuming still HM
2013-07-11T22:10:53-0700,Pokmon jumped shark character designs last set bunch gears pokemon Ice cream cones stupid know made get quota filled yes next set pokemon even worse sword pokemon indication ton really bad pokemon set
2013-07-11T22:29:54-0700,pretty much loved Pokemon far least liked Honedge really awesome Im quite excited himI dont get whole Pokemon animals thing Theyve never animals Anyone remember Muk Hes pile pollution crying loud Pokemon cant possessed sword
2013-07-11T23:39:09-0700,18 types many combos create anyone yet discovered animal best fits steelghost sort creature fit type comboWhomever thought cultural myths mixed Pokemon genius Sure makes creativity design less needed worldwide game adding touch culture bonusSeems Gamefreak working new designs working already 17 typesExpanding one thing adding new type like added dark steel opened way toss stratagy among battlesFantasy imagination creativity design restriction left expectation would original ideas concept would become old boring plus repetitive

2013-07-12T10:37:39-0700,stop truer statement think Pokmon issillyJust underlying animal plant design doesnt make plausible fantastic elements still Pokmon SPBs Super Powered Beings whatever preferred terminology things break laws reality time stored inside tiny little balls elemental affinity sometimes two creates unrealistic relationships designs dubious reality especially upon closer inspectionHonedge adaptation mythlegend like Charizard difference ghosts exist world Pokmon allow Honedge actually realistic Charizard Blastoise Venusaur etcAgain dont like told others think stupid think stupid implication objective validity given older Pokmon pretty absurd Pokmon wonderfully absurd makebelieve Pokmon plausible frankly failure
2013-07-12T12:10:51-0700,find Honedge interesting three Starter Pokemon combined personally Well actually combined together maybe would interesting
2013-07-12T13:58:48-0700,always thought Magneton could awesome actually threefused together Probably complicated back imagine yes raise threeto correct level trigger even got select traits used create Evolved form eg Ability Nature Moves individual StatAs Transformers fan totally want team five Pokmon optionally combine make sixth sure would painfully hard design would worth effort sheer awesome even ultimately proved either broken competitive play underpowered risks thumbOn slightly serious note appropriate Pokmon like Honedge option well weve seen TCG Honedge could treat like Pokmon Tool compatible Pokmon
2013-07-12T15:54:52-0700,Goronda known asPangoroin EnglishMaika Karamanero known asInkay MalamarrespectivelyShushupu known asSpritzeePeropuff calledSwirlixXerneas attack Geo ControlJapanese known asGeomancyYvetals attack Death WingJapanese calledOblivion WingAnd Otaku ideas magnificent ambitious could combining Pokemon Voltron mon
2013-07-12T18:20:20-0700,Perhaps less ambitious idea two Pokmon linking one acting like Pokmon Tool perhaps even allowed function second Pokmon Tool Obviously could worthless avoid overpowered need make sure mixing Pokmon way risky course OHKO attacks already provide Attacks discard Pokmon Tools might disconnect Pokmon functioning Pokmon Tools damaging maybe even autoKoing themI image head Machoke Honedge attached one hand Bronzor Kabuto head maybe two different Unown one front one back torso glowing cool looking
2013-07-12T18:46:31-0700,really like idea though Pairing 2 Pokemon even keeping 6 limit could make interesting mechanics Honedge obvious example sword Pokemon could allow type alterations attacks like making Water type attack Empoleon Fire type well paired tooled Charizard Pokemon fast like Scyther could paired something add Quick Attack top attack Pokemon uses Possibilities endless front though guessI quick search couldnt bring saw really neat picture Golurk Brozor Honedge superimposed like sword shield idea reminded Sigi art 3 colors similar still looked neat
2013-07-14T17:23:42-0700,think gens Pokemon released far much cooler ones gen 5 personal opinion Gen 6 shaping much interesting theme European mind Pokemon fit much clearlyEurope makes think Pokemon certain extent medieval times seemed lot wonder world unicorns dragons fairies oh even thats modern perception peoples beliefs Honedge Medieval look perfume makes think France okay cant really think place pandas like Spinda lionlooking Pokemon make think Trafalgar Square coats armsGen 5 themes ideals dreams location futuristic Pokemon tightly fit sort difficult designwise stark opposites distance always clear thats pretty hard convey whole set Pokemon although fine legendaries
2013-07-14T22:13:30-0700,Im still hoping tiger pokemon come lol
2013-07-15T09:51:02-0700,Gen 3s theme duality LOT Pokemon pairs generation gen 4s theme historyI think gen 5s design theme familiar new since first game taking place outside Japan

2013-06-21T17:59:53-0700,Closed think answered threads discussed
2013-06-13T13:28:14-0700,6th Gen coming October adding Pokmon think changing competitive scene current Meta GameFairy Type sure shake things waysThere newer moves hopefully stronger Attacks included Types little support like Poison Types think Pokmon stronger Attacks switch tactics bitWill first Regionals VGC Tournament 6th Gen Pokemon onlySo many questions want make lengthy list change coming soon VGC formatWhat thoughts VGC Competitive Scene release 6th gen
2013-06-13T14:56:19-0700,want see balance game dont want see Shell Smash moves like want know fairy types matchupVGC different sure yeah Fairy types immunities dragon type attacks huge sure
2013-06-13T16:56:50-0700,Fairy actually immunity even resistance Dragon Fairy attacks merely Super Effective Dragons
2013-06-13T18:35:31-0700,IMO Fairys effectiveness ultimately depend immunities resistances example doesnt either vs Dragon Id much rather Steel type still something like Metagross take Dragon attacks impunity still nab 2HKO good situations Otherwise whats benefit SE Fairy attack Dragon use Dragon beat also guess well see rumor true otherwise weakness Poison Steel isnt bad dont get fire resistance kinda odd Fire Pokemon would randomly resistant Fariyshrug
2013-06-13T18:51:02-0700,Fairy Type Attacks interesting see comes aboutAttacks like WillOWisp possibility Fairy type couls recieve support areaIt interesting see Pokemon access Fairy type attacks wait see comes Like TM
2013-06-13T19:59:32-0700,couple questionsIm really much competitive player play fun value competitive stats whatnot versus Pokemon game said couple questions1 First make Dragon type powerful first place find need balance Fairy type Seems silly hindsight Shrug2 Regarding comment someone made restoring power creep game would besides maybe either lowering andor increasing overall base stats wouldnt upset people say Dragonites base stats dropped 50100 pointsIm personally looking forward seeing Fairy types though hope nicely balanced powerful Pokemon category second thing piques interest new information horde battle One five sounds awesome unless Pokemon isnt prepared course Oh stepping PokemonLOL
2013-06-13T20:31:34-0700,first thing Base Stats need change Pokemon base stat 470 stage 2 Pokemon 600 Yes species Pokemon better way Pokemon need competitive edge way making attacks like Shell Smash Balanced Base Stats thing looked tied species Pokemon based animals competitive edge others even though may strongerThe idea balance stats competitive scene become using best making team good stuff Since new game change fix Perhaps Lati twins dont need base stat total 600 Pokemon like Metagross also powerful movepools Abilities also need unique Pokemon useful Keen Eyes ability bird Pokemon mean attacks always hit abilities useless competitive playIf remember ability Sturdy use Pokemon unable hit moves KOed 1 hit changed attack would KO full HP one HP left like Focus Sash ability overpowered competitive play game fixed power creep power creep needs stop fresh start hope
2013-06-13T22:03:20-0700,Guess would kind line example gave reducing Dragonite pseudoLegendaries would love see favorite Pokemon betterbalanced stats studying base stats rather extensively last couple months nonLegendaries even break 100 Attack Special Attackfor example course may may focus people competitive circle dont like zone Legendaries make great teamvariety niceAs abilities suggest would niceHeatran example seems rather unique ability combined stats manymostthat look abilities gloss completely useless agenda Maybe Pokemon like Reshiram Zekromthough part appeal stats seems makes cool ability bypass Sturdy etc Heh power creeping power creep still good marriage two stats ability would go long way make interesting PokemonJust two cents Oh guess mentioned power creep commentfinally found post wanted clarify credit
2013-06-13T22:39:50-0700,Another thing abilities balance give Pokemon Dragon Dance ability Moxie would like Pokemon unique abilities change flow battle Speed Boost needs go 6 timesAs legendaries abilities also need balance Mold Breaker hard deal pokemon 670 base stats ability ignores everything bit OP
2013-06-13T22:59:09-0700,complaints bunch combinations dont even see much play tournaments cant remember last time saw Scrafty use Dragon Dance Moxie ok maybe 2011 use Sturdy sees LV1 Aron things dont think Ive ever seen Shell Smash used competent player nerfing Latias last thing needs doneBenzo games likely come either around first set Regionals Gen 5 still almost certainly used first regional new seasonThere one Dragon type Gen 1 dragon attacks aside Dragon Rage always set 40 GSC came along didnt anything fix last time type chart changed 4 generations later enough changed feel type chart needs changed bit
2013-06-14T00:45:38-0700,Agreed would flipside said ReshiramZekrom Though must say love Mold Breaker going something Sturdy Rogenrola drives crazy LOL think part thats horde battles supposed counterIn games play Ive come point try use Pokemon Legendaries pseudoLegendaries challenge though given stats stacked favor doubt worse actual competition Honestly Id probably well competitionRealistically see MAYBE giving new Pokemon greater power much older generations much easier someone upgrade macrolevel downgrade Makes think Power Rangers series progresses creators find need mega megazords whatever Eventually gets entirely ridiculous reboot new Power Rangers seriesstarting cycle Similarly TCG XY actually reboot
2013-06-14T01:02:41-0700,decided base stats Pokemon alone break normal sure many Pokemon like cant hang VGC even abilitySome abilities circumstantial useless make wonder even helps Pokemon weak base stats first placeOne thing would nice rely Dream World get Pokemon new ability breeding Pokemon time consuming since three abilities requires female pass onBase stats alone even 31 IV still make good number Pokemon unable hang VGC yet game story line great battlers would like see balance available Pokemon Types become worthy seeing battle front lineIn many ways tend forget game focus competitive side like start game toughest Pokemon unless like trade Pokies 6 blast main story line get building competitive team time right away available later story line see Pokemon stepping stones get story lineI think balance add Pokemon make battle worthyness Like many Poison Type Pokemon see VGC Bug Ground Flying increase competitive worthy Pokemon TypeSure Dragon Type Psychic Type 1st Gen currently adding balance understandable advancing competitive side additional Pokemon roster Type wise probably last thing consider change games since game RPG VGC game featureI wonder transition move sets go converted Pre 6th Gen Pokemon goes far move lineup almost seems move leveling process lose moves replaced new Fairy Type good change bad option choose either move level
2013-06-14T01:06:13-0700,hope XY reboot adding fairy type game making older Pokemon fairies well also power change stats Pokemon XY completely new game series adding things BW handled poorly hope learned best place start would raise stats Pokemon need lower big ones altogether
2013-06-14T01:43:13-0700,Theyve said IVEV noticable XY hope easier control massive breedinghatching leads players RNGing
2013-06-14T08:05:09-0700,reservation changing base stats significant degree move sets greater potential alter game imo mentioned Types like poison forthgive better attacks could make big difference Pokemon one uses wouldnt mind losing old moves means upgrading quality attacks probably dont even cut anymany add games becoming efficient holding information
2013-06-14T11:46:37-0700,point going mention well games memory size verses older cartridges amount TMs cut amount TMs move tutors Pokmon higher move list available Dropping weaker attacks stronger ones Sure attacks like Poison Sting midrang attack final evolution stage able upgrade even stronger attack via move tutor TM make competitive nice
2013-06-15T13:41:15-0700,thing Dragon types inherently arent super powerful terms typing weak Ice hurts many posses flying subtype makes Ice even worse well opening Rock weakness losing Electric resistance firewatergrass resistance nice like tons resistances like Steel Dragon hits Super Effective damage Normal weaker attacking perspective since hits nothing SE hits 2 resisted damage cant touch ghost allRather dragon strong couple factors possesses 2 powerful attacks Draco Meteor Outrage given lack resistances immunities Steel types resist dragon attacks high base power 140 120 gives almost universal coverage basically 1 big nuke case Draco Meteor inflate Choice Specs Dragon Gem anything Draco Meteor think main problem doubles seems centralize degree Pokemon take hit survive steel type obligatory teams well dragon moves deal simply Draco Meteor OHKO power Pokemon doubles 4 Pokemon losing one lot damaging Singles thing dragon going popular ones Salamence Hydreigon Garchomp Dragonite upper level base stats normal PokemonConsider Psychic types old dominant typing back RBY strongest attack accessible type Psychic caps 90 BP Deoxys Psycho Boost psychic Draco Meteor unusable rulesets mention Deoxys incredibly frail defensively ruinous Pokemon like Chansey Blissey wall death unless happen use Psyshock insteadSo honestly take away Draco Meteor tutor move get make exclusive legendaries like Palkia Outrage manageable unusable doubles easily switched singles add another weakness couple Pokemon resist Dragon Steel think could balance without throw new type counter others like Dark
2013-06-15T13:49:22-0700,Like someone mentioning Nugget Bridge itd actually kinda nice away IVs junk like certain sites download Pokemon wouldnt much purpose evens playing field bit every Pokemon basically clean slate imprint EVs onto Hidden Power simply away make like stones click select type like swap Rotom forms going right appliance
2013-06-17T04:36:24-0700,mentioned exact IV idea beach along blocking simply allowing transfer mons BW12 create headache new mechanic like idea lol
2013-06-17T11:43:28-0700,Id like see removal IVs well dont suppose anymore competitive players
2013-06-18T16:56:08-0700,Exactly loss IV mechanic leaving EV mechanic place visibility games would level playing field newcomers veterans less stellar amount time hand train breed even RNGI problem RNGing BW figured even though much faster breeding desired shiny perfect stats perfect legend still time consuming adult full time job hard find time even use Pokemon products loved decade advent online tournaments last couple years would increase chances jumping competitive scene goes PTCGO well though
2013-06-18T17:17:37-0700,IVs removed good idea Allowing base stats determine placement EVs IMO better route take Breeding less pressuring think type main factors weakness verses need IVs determine advantageTake 2 Pokemon Charizard vs CharizardYou need place EVs stats wanting advantage looking win speed war example Isnt Nature Personality forNo two Pokmon yet base stats IVs factor keeping different sort contradicting IMO
2013-06-19T10:16:28-0700,would need system make Pokemon easier maintain IVs many players know IVs EVs real chance compete likes Still advanced players need learning curve get since internet competitive play IV EV system date turn based PvP system date
2013-06-19T16:37:45-0700,Personally think nature system expanded offset removal IVs Example Malicious nature Atk 5 Sp Atk 5 Defense 10 Courteous nature 5DefSp Def 10 SpeedIf added many natures every split positive combo split negative combo would would get psuedo variety effect varied IV determine 2 points stat level 100 certainly would give Pokemon varied outcome current nature system aloneJust idea Id really like see IVs go way buffaloEDIT Getting even depth could even add 15 15 natures give even greater variety
2013-06-19T19:30:19-0700,might understanding sayingAre saying Nature personality effect base stats replacement IV systemOr base stats solid nature auto addsubtracts difference max total base stat 15 ExampleBase stat attack say 100 Total stat count without EVs added say 200 EVd would 300So modest nature attack stat 15 per 100 count modest nature would total 255 max wanted add EVs would still hit max 300Or way saying
2013-06-20T04:47:37-0700,Sorry probably bit tired wrote may seem garbled hard understandCurrently nature system gives bonuses deductions certain stats 24 natures available time Im suggesting adding varied differences stat increases decreasesSo currently 4 natures nothing Docile 4 natures boost attack defense sp atk sp def speed respectively lowering one 5 specific stats depending natureThe amount current natures raise stat 10 one nature lowers lowered 10 nature modifies 2 base stats Pokemon using 10 exchangeIf added say 20 natures mix could see much varying stat exchanges would keep Pokemons uniqueness degree offer simpler alternative IVsMy examples instead keeping 10 exchange rate could make natures exchange rate 15 lowering 3 stats 5 raising 1 15 lowering stat 5 one 10 raising 3 stats 5Im sure explained better time hopefully get Im saying think nature system could expanded somewhat replace variance IVs given us
2013-06-20T12:48:09-0700,understand lol think bit tired side myselfAdding natures would nice toss pool available stat side things vs relying IVsThe thing IVs 031 random odds getting greatexcellent Pokmon much favor weaker side tossing Natures adds weaker sideHaving zero IV attack adamant nature crud worse31 IV special attack zero IV attack adamant natureNow breeding breeding mechanics getting result without jump lengthy process female dream world ability could go onwithout knowing rng looking IV system hindering time consuming knowing greater chance Pokmon still sits lower end excellent side line due IVs
2013-06-20T14:19:47-0700,would also like kind game way change Pokemons ability want could Pokemon Conquest would like see return Would also help breed different Pokemon abilities
2013-06-21T00:15:59-0700,would cool highly doubt new feature competitive side abilities many worth battle use Plus Pokmon 3 abilities still abilities even available themBreeding battle worthy Pokmon option able select ability golden Perhaps golden breeding mechs still afraid sayWhat triple rotation battles Anything double battles rather bleh competitive scene Air battles water battles maybeI think going spice things little think environments bit interactive would sort cool Imagine tournament grass burnt little flamethrower attack small amount back ground interaction would sort coolNew thoughtFairy typeThis new type obviously shake things extent better thing nonfairy type fairy type attack better use Fairy type teamMoves move power least expect 15 fairy type attacks guys think
2013-06-21T07:37:07-0700,IMO play noncompetitive environment like power stats Attack Special Attack Fairy types ability KO things well Id defer nonFairy type using Fairy attack Dragon supereffective Fairy counterOtherwise nice Fairy monstrous stats would kinda neat
2013-06-21T14:29:08-0700,anything hope double attacks onto Pokmon super effective like decide new Fairy types Dragon Fairy type attacks Sort Pokmon learn Ice Dragon attacksIn list new attacks boost power Pokmon type get STABDark example could use boost move pool department far attacks offer choice available Pokmon competitive scene alone great adding list battle worthy Pokmon
2013-06-03T17:51:30-0700,Anyone want write front pagePost new topic describing situation well Ill move front page
2013-05-11T07:55:08-0700,Serebii posted two pages CoroCoro article information Pokemon X revealing four new PokemonGogoat riding Pokemon Grass Type 17m 910kgElikiteru Electric normal Type new move Barabora ChargeYayakoma Japanese Robin Pokemon NormalFlying Type 03m 17kgYancham Naughty Pokemon Fighting Type 06m 80kg new move Parting RemarkThe two pages also revealed name new region Karos Region main city region Miare City change skin hair color character ride certain Pokemon including Gogoat around game probably instead bicycle think change hair skin color start game unlock trainer customization items go picture region region kind looks star shaped also guy looks similar N second page think hes rival pics meeting random areas Pokemon also reveal two different move sets Chespin since theyre translated unknown whether Chespin new move OK information revealed momentJust remember Japanese names Gogoat Elikiteru Yayakoma Yancham Karos Miare probably going English versions
2013-05-11T08:38:58-0700,ever going werewolf pokemon dragons unicorns every mythical animal weres
2013-05-11T09:22:01-0700,think Zoroark werewolf transformation steroids
2013-05-11T09:51:07-0700,Guys see new player charactersGuysThe girl freakin adorableAnd SCREENSHOTS AndOh god Im excited
2013-05-11T11:35:30-0700,like character designs wish werent chibified game Theres reason anymore Coliseum nicest looking game far humans concerned
2013-05-11T12:07:34-0700,lizard stands bit thats cause colour scheme similar Shieldon someone Hopefully Panda evolve something giant
2013-05-11T12:11:11-0700,agree wish werent chibified extent still gotta remember really kids game lolBut yeah like actually ride Pokemon Wonder itll retroactive older candidates like PonytaRapidash fighting type panda sounds fun even itll spawn endless jokes kung fu pandaThe customization Trainer nice touch well even looks kinda limited Nice instead none
2013-05-11T12:13:11-0700,Im definitively happy character designs though boy sorta looks like character BW new hairdoThe new Pokemon interestingI really like birdie hopefully would evolve something uglyThe panda cute mischievous like himThe goat take getting used hes badIm sure lizard however looks sorta like Mawile four legs
2013-05-11T14:48:33-0700,hmmmmmm riding Pokemon possible races gameI wonder FLY FP like control flying surf cool FP wellNavigating region would shweet step forward travel mechanics
2013-05-11T14:52:55-0700,first put thread also thought Elikiteru looked like prevolution Mawile looked back picture gameplay look like electric type revealed name type itThere probably Pokemon races would make lot sense dont think going show animations flight would probably take much data space game flight animations also people like flying quick dont waste time Surfing FP would new probably never happen people like able see around FP games like tunnel vision Also noticed Pokemon main characters riding saddle probably get saddle riding Pokemon
2013-05-11T15:49:02-0700,actually thinking player controlled flying would beautiful able see region sky would amazing thinking sort like short animation Pokemon grabbing fly takes place touch screen gives option fly manually dont press animation flying ends like game press get control Pokemon could fly around destination touch screen would display land option places havent thinking either dont land option player backflip turn around goes far similar Spyro flying levels Playstation
2013-05-11T16:12:32-0700,Heh second set games prefer male player characters design females much prefer Ethan Lyra closer contest though Also RedLeaf GoldCrystal pretty evenHeh Pokemon robin looks promising designwise doesnt look anything special stage look good evolves traits young bird make look really good fan ones though goat probably good Pokemon ElectricNormal odd typing making wonder theyll change type matchups little since Electric Normal arent useful combination really offers nothing extra weaknesses mostly useless Ghost immunity marginally useful Electric resistance first time Ive thought theyd change type relations generation though
2013-05-11T17:18:05-0700,think would fun allowed also ride older gen Pokemon Running across fields riding Rapidash would fun
2013-05-11T23:31:17-0700,AgreedI really like character designs like customize hairskin color Things really looking awesome cant wait next info
2013-05-12T01:17:55-0700,really hope bird looks better evolves basic form looks way plain also hope dont get rid EV IV systems need release information game
2013-05-12T04:01:17-0700,hope birds evolutions look better idea getting rid EV IV systems come Also yes need release information games theyre got 5 months take time anxious hear Pokemon X
2013-05-12T05:16:24-0700,wish theyd announce fairy type light whatever gonna called

2013-05-13T20:17:54-0700,used hate idea new type Ill happy type exactly like Hiro described think reclassifying Pokemon fairy types even format
2013-05-13T20:43:42-0700,Yes would nice new type however Mawile pokemonWhen think fairies totally think giant teeth gnashing
2013-05-13T21:03:19-0700,Mawiles origin stems sort Japanese folklore believe dont know much based could well fall traditional fairy category Fairies evil gross looking actually less restricting type Bug DragonEdit fairy changeling Wouldnt cool Pokemon Sure Ditto genetic based thing also Zoroark illusion anything Idk maybe would redundant lol
2013-05-14T04:22:32-0700,Mawiles origin futakuchionna Japanese youkai monsterdemon another mouth back head
2013-05-14T05:29:32-0700,us guess Pokemon reclassified Fairy Type well probably grow like play thinking Mawile FairySteel wouldnt type chart look something like thisNormal x 05Fire x 2Water x 1Grass x 05Electric x 1Ice x 05Fighting x 2Poison x 0Ground x 2Flying x 05Psychic x 05Bug x 05Rock x 05Ghost x 05Dragon x 0Dark x 05Steel x 1Fairy x 1Looking Mawile three weaknesses Metagross Mawile also immune Dragon well Poison thing makes irrelevant lack stats Mawile
2013-05-14T08:00:21-0700,Ive always liked MawileOh btw looks like rumors likely true Pokebeach posted supposed names 4 Pokemon revealed confirmed morning got names source told Fairy even stretch Fairy type false
2013-05-14T09:47:18-0700,far still love Fennekin obvious reasons biggrin really hope evolve epic FirePsychic type Anything FireFighting nononoI actually really like Gogoat one thing Grass type theres Fennekins Water counter Another thing ride around town must pretty big compared main character learns Horn Leech one favorite moves looks cool stats right could one main Party membersIm indifferent new Pokemon Fletchling seems legit though simple yet cool like learn Flame Charge Makes decent counter move IcetypesOn game itslef player character designs awesome sure shades like degree customization actually dont mind chibi sprites nice anime feel 3D visuals look stunning especially adorable Fennekin biggrin Navigation longer left right according sreenshots apparently able move diagonally seems like small change actually large improvement IMO like differing modes transportationThis leap foward pokemon fans game Needlessly say SOOO gonna buy game
2013-05-14T14:49:04-0700,Well personally didnt read would certainly appreciate games case Instead buying opposite one sons choice Id buy could put money whichever one chose already mine preordered hope officially announce soon preorder one well isnt case obviously dont need preorder certainly nice bit gossip anyways
2013-05-14T15:41:07-0700,might something like BW could go west beat E4 case could X go coastal beat E4 head mountains vice versa
2013-05-14T22:36:24-0700,Looking region map looks like Pokemon version Stonehenge left Kalos along mysterious single island surrounded stones near top left map also appears strange structure underneath mysterious island appears something like safari farm Also small patch desert appears group strange technological structures one one near magma looks like one first trailer right Lumiose City center seems old castle weird pedestal front upper right Lumiose City small white sort building small tell Also castle appears cave yet another pedestal right castle appears cycling path anyone figure forAnyways think starting town either north region town star shaped mountain area town near coast southwest main city near weird stonehengelooking thing think likely would town near coast seems traditional Pokemon start town grass battle catch Pokemon besides one pictures Pokebeach showed wild Fletchling Lv 2 battledAnother thing noticed Pokemon summary box picture Chespin Froakie Fennekin showed next page ribbons could either mean reintroducing Pokemon contests something like earn ribbons theyve done event Pokemon ribbonsI think found something region map appears evil team Kalos region immediate right Lumiose City giant purple crystal also think technological buildings near patch desert also something evil teamLooking back first X trailer remember showed Yveltal clouds Xerneas front giant hollow tree Well Yveltal might giant ice mountain heaps clouds seems like place put legendary Pokemon Xerneas possibly found near giant tree forest castleHere random things Ive noticed mapTo southwest Lumiose City appears place grow something possibly farmTo south Lumiose City looks giant performance area Also front appears palm treesThere two forest islands underneath mysterious islandWell find map hope revealed soonNorth Stonehenge theres place kind looks like would perfect place fairy Gym remember might well call Hiros information real hes proven lot alreadyI looked back first trailer saw three gym areas Psychic Bug Fire going Hiros information gyms gyms game01 Bug02 Fairy Fire04 Fighting PsychicClose Lumiose City theres place looks like Kantos route 12To east Stonehenge appears Pokemon DaycareNear cloudy Mountain theres town Windmill snow flake design would perfect ice gymJust purple crystal theres mine rail cart tracksWell thats find map moment really hope someone replies thread thread getting boring
2013-05-15T20:51:11-0700,say name goat Gogoat Seriously like Gocart goat instead cart Snort rather amusing think
2013-05-15T21:38:03-0700,think named ride goat would named
2013-05-16T11:40:56-0700,Yeah one American stereotypesI think new generation Canadian accent losing could gone forever
2013-05-16T13:19:24-0700,American thing Iowan living South Dakota doesnt get lol
2013-05-16T17:10:57-0700,anyone wondering Stonehenge structure might anything like
2013-05-16T17:20:51-0700,Yeah dont mean offense course Canadian really idea hes talking Maybe makes funny hey knows eh Maybe needs bit maple syrup eh Mounties eh itll hilarious
2013-05-16T18:58:18-0700,Hes referring stereotype canadians pronouncing OAT
2013-05-16T20:25:57-0700,Ah Must sort maritime accent Ok guess Kinda silly call Canadian accent Texans drawl Bronx accent American accent hey know Yall might wanna know Im Ontario theres discernible accent Thats probably didnt get guess thats call stereotype cuz stupid invariably wrong
2013-05-17T01:05:54-0700,think someone brought Canadian name Gogoat Also people think Stonehenge place
2013-05-17T02:18:16-0700,Possible ruins maybe decided give Regis new forms added new Regi mixMaybe Unown make comeback thought cool able custombuild PokeballsRibbons reterning would nice Absol 47 ribbons would shweet stack itI personally woould love see growingbuying berries make way back Like garden beside house secret baseAlso hoping download content something along lines opening areas map Accessing areas defeating E4 nothing new add play value reaching main story line becomming champ think expanding load content like ExplorerDungeon games would really nice change
2013-05-17T03:20:48-0700,kinda liked Pokmon Conquest type crossover download content think might cool try something like perhaps Donkey Kong Country Returns type crossover navigation trees introduced Dive added content water seemed open possibilities movement games need content showcase 3D environment 3D movement possibly move like Jump
2013-05-17T14:06:45-0700,explainedWhy would want call something pronounced Goatoat Plus isnt part GrassType Goatoat might actually make little sense
2013-05-17T20:04:18-0700,Ill go ahead say since havent heard seen mention one However theres apparently something big going Pokemon Smash Sunday
2013-05-17T20:29:14-0700,ones really acknowledged actual Pokemon since pretty hard tell exactly could decoration modeled Pokemon know
2013-05-17T20:35:17-0700,speculation preevolved form Gogoat
2013-05-17T20:35:22-0700,Good catch Trader Yeah looks kinda like couple fairly large guinea pig type pokemon green grey beige looking Hard make course since blowing picture makes pixelated definitely worth lookEdit yeah looking could see preevolution Gogoat especially since similar coloring
2013-05-17T20:42:16-0700,video isnt itMaybe get closer lookThough cant take credit someone another pokemon community showed
2013-05-17T20:55:37-0700,think Stonehenge place might Legendarys place like Lake Verity Mesprit remember Junichi Masuda said back Feburary 21st games would take full advantage 3DS hardware Im hoping Stonehenge place like Outrealm Gate Fire Emblem Awakening buy DLC packs buy new side stories new places X would awesome Also Unown X theyre probably mysterious island coast near town light housePS thought Stonehenge place like Burnt Tower Ecruteak City encounter trio legendary Pokemon disband
2013-05-18T01:21:41-0700,read somewhere could possibly place encounter Xerneas
2013-05-18T04:08:49-0700,Look Kalos Region map south castle pedestal youll see forest end forest see giant tree Also remember first X trailer Xerneas shown standing front giant tree giant stones besides way close possible starting town
2013-05-18T04:14:50-0700,knows point honest though previous games legendary appears location integral plot stonehedge location could since legendaries seem different origins opposed previous legendaries may see different locations like Hooh Lugia
2013-05-18T07:39:39-0700,remember official trailer HGSS showed Lugia Hooh appearing respective areas something similar X Ys official trailer Yveltal clouds Xerneas front giant tree big tree see map one saw south castle forest besides tell one Pokemon game main Legendary close starting town Im bit sick calling possible starting town looks like town would fit description starting town
2013-05-18T07:54:52-0700,dont deny Im merely saying precedent says appear place presentation legends implies may beA personal theory mine three legendaries assuming third also represent three sections Pokedex Xerneas Main Yveltal Mountain Z Ocean

2013-05-28T09:51:38-0700,Wasnt thread originally created talk 4 new Pokemon revealed Seems like bit derailed least page nowI personally love Pancham Heloptiles designs feel Fletchling Gogoat leave something desired terms design naming
2013-05-28T10:51:16-0700,find Fletchling disappointing like many local version Pokmon Id prefer actually got local variations existing Pokmon instead reinventing wheel could lead alternate color schemes arent Shiny well
2013-05-28T11:14:16-0700,totally agree Really way see Fletchling redeemed another local version mon gains Fire type place Normal somwhere along evolutionary line
2013-05-28T11:22:30-0700,would liked better Pidgey suppose everywhere anyway design great IMO getting Flame charge nothing great well every bird past gen got Heat WaveI hope design gets stronger evolution
2013-05-28T16:18:41-0700,Im simply going note trend also present gen 1 Lest forget Fearowalthough seems many havePlus common birds great differentiation bird cousins Staraptor got Close Combat great stats Swellow received similar treatment Plus isnt like theres great variety normal birds real life begin withIt may reinventing wheel theres creation Pokemon typing
2013-05-28T17:15:23-0700,Actually soft place heart Fearow fact another common NormalFlying Type fails distinguish designers heads fansThese video games reason Pokmon bland designed way reason many us complaining lucky lot Pokmon purpose good move pool Ability get problem rest ilk compete Yes good examples amongst NormalFlying Bird Pokmon one numerous groups would hard make bland forgettableSo instead trying find way make Pokmon seem new exciting different Pokmon previous game filled niche role use Pokmon previous game fill niche roll give new paint job Ability tweaked move list according new habitat
2013-05-28T17:24:02-0700,theyre based real birds designers fault nature hasnt given much work Plus kind appreciate common birds arent pigeons instead get birds prey nocturnal birds Sure doesnt much game design wonders world design least IMO
2013-05-28T18:00:57-0700,requirement real birds adapted world Pokmon NormalFlyingTypes fantasy world even plausible within internal logic Pokmon could less widespread comparable realworld speciesYou know fond fantasy RPGs something learned make worlds varied rich things like applying local lenses fantasy races course talking actual roleplaying games eg pencilandpaper video games roleplaying involved actually make relevantInstead giving 650 Pokmon maybe third memorable good way third memorable bad way rest blur together would rather get depth actually exists Even current model followed nothing forces restrictive typing wasnt Noctowl DarkFlyingType best reason think Murkrow already coming case one probably could haveshould delayed later generationOf course like things isfine merely explaining part things done dont reflect tastes
2013-05-28T18:42:19-0700,IMO expansion enriching go hand hand said appreciate diversity common birds IMO theyre memorable way expands world revisiting older Pokemon ie Cresselias sidequest BW2 importantPart reason love Pokemon open interpretation available different tastes take advantage birds cater Fletchling example become somewhat meme instanceIts fine doesnt coincide personal approach franchise difficult satisfy everyone anything especially something like Pokemon many different creatures running around

2013-05-13T21:31:06-0700,plans playing game lack Pokemon liked game killed motivation continue playing Since could return game downloaded Nintendo E Shop figured Id play money would wastedSTORYThe story starts way forcing Player take role Pokemon taking Human World bringing Pokemon World game lacks Personality Quiz see start game give option one five Pokemon chose Pikachu Snivy Tepig Oshawott Axew Thats right 5 Pokemon see Pokemon Black White anime Cartoon Network choose partner cant pick Pokemon chose start adventureThe story start find Pokemon World full Pokemon trust issues making know cant trust Pokemon said many times game Due created imbalance threaten destroy Pokemon World Pokemon choose haunted dream shows Munna chased Hydreigon makes player feel save Munna monster trying harm MunnaAfter first Dungeon Virizion makes first appearance whole town huge crush making known Dunsparce biggest crush wants prove due finding gem early first adventure give Dunsparce give Virizion turns rudely Dunsparce runs embarrassment turned Emolga Dunsparces friend started acting like going beat Virizion trying nice Virizion responded could take want used anyone turns want keep anyone close happened Keldeo whoher best friend turns trying protect Dunsparce Virizion joins team level 20 main team may around level 8 9As story continues meet Espeon Umbreon explorers study Magnagates use cards open locations dungeon know work join team level 25 26 dont really rememberAs story progresses learn real enemies learn dream character taken wrong way true enemy happens Munna Hydreigon trying stop destroying world learn Munna working Kyurem make sure BitterCold could stopped learn BitterCold manifested due negativity Pokemon created due trust issues Pokemon character chose play must overcome Hydreigon joins team partner Pokemon captured Munna gang free partner shortly Hydreigon join team level 62 continue encounter Kyurem kills Hydreigon freezing ice block Dragon Tails breaking peacesYou learn much Hydreigon Voice Life connection Universe Pokemon call Human World help calm calamity Pokemon World defeat BitterCold team goes flying Ice Palace split team though partner Pokemon characters play get far enough run Purugly gang must stop fighting Kyurem fight kyurem though one fights lose continue story wrong win fight worst damage put around 70 damage could two shot characters big attack around 115 enough KO characters 1 hitAfter fight beat Kyurem go BitterCold Ice Crystal monster looks like final boss StarFox Assault fight annoying cant damage first like 10 hits something first time lose dont lose items every time lose items top attacks generate random status effects also fight BitterCold Pokemon chose play Pokemon fight one one fight BitterColds attacks 35 damage well berriesseeds orbs friendOnce finish BetterCold go 30 minute cut scene seems like anyway watched like 3 episodes Regular Show still going ends Pokemon chose play go back Human World leaving gamePOST STORYWhen start game go another cut scene playable character ending partner Pokemon jobs get cut scenes telling getting main character back enough Hydreigon tells possible get main character back wish unbalance Universe characters go moral issues wondering okay remove character friends family come back game unlocks dungeon called Worldcore go make wish died 7 floors ran items use beat yet dungeon makes go solo Pokemon really powerful jump 3 4 time Monster Houses brutal wellSo far seems post story getting back main character thats hereGAMEPLAY MECHANICSThe game plays MD games changes main core system tact remove hunger system game 2 DLC dungeons IQ systems work differently game Pokemon independent work whole team instead dont learn IQ Skills find open chest may IQ Skill game also system attack growth time use attack successfully adds total times used 10 times use makes attack grow stronger Attacks level gain power PP Whats even better attacks share power matter uses Pokemon share attack power play game Pikachu level 7 Thunderbolt later add Jolteon team Jolteon learns Thunderbolt also level 7 dont really like system takes away training like dungeon crawlers welcomedMonster Houses stick around problematic habit putting trap first space room ends Sleep Trap ends loss cant prevent also put Monster Houses room stairs pain deal Stair Rooms suppose safe game care also force many orbs healing items hand time big issue annoyingThe Game also add something called VWave forecast system ran Victini tells type wave day VWave makes certain Pokemon types stronger day gives added effects VWave Dragon Dragon type Pokemon stronger gain number effectsYou change VWave per day talking Victini get free spin pay number P better chance changing smart check VWave high level missionsDIFFICULTYThe game really hard really annoying Pokemon game powered Stat Level ratio flawed People also say Pokemon reach certain stat limit stop gaining multi hit attacks deal much damage game get lot deaths biggest thing come item usage take lot damage everything attacks miss constantly enemy eat items time another annoying part game Attacks eat items lose lot important items like Oran Berries Reviver Seeds wayAttacks also deal inconstant damage time think youre safe Pokemon deal lot damage deals 100 damage Evolved Pokemon extremely overpowered Braviary seems overpowered dealing ton damage able take lot damage also hold B button together gain health back theres real consequence game threatening kick dungeon taking long floor hunger means camp wantThe game also gives lot Pokemon really high level first Pokemon get level 20 last one level 62 Keldeo joins level 50 game gives Pokemon make game far easy rather use Dunsparce Hydreigon games main difficulty comes random elements time really nothing hope luck game also throws random elements dungeons finish main story help hurt range level 1 5 higher level ofter happen either Pokemon sleeping put new dungeon able use itemsThis really difficulty game forces use Street Pass want revived died dungeon issue one area game Street Pass better could call friend IM someone give code rescue need rescue cant use one area game quit dungeon try games need Street Pass game one themOTHER STUFF DOYou build land huge Pokemon Paradise see Pokemon join walk around take jobs complete earn materials use build new area add stores Youll also earn points add Paradise Rank rank rewarded greatly well able hold Pokemon Paradise Like last MD game store Missions want later right away also missions friend using left Mission gate one setup play friend also fight Legendary Pokemon missions overpowered though beat smartly playing Hydreigon done thisYou also play Companion Mode mode walk around Pokemon choice missions cant leave Paradise area big deal always main Pokemon party cant change Leader Companion mode missions build Paradise also use four Pokemon want Pokemon chose play partner real reason modeOn main menu click option called Discover Magnagate mode uses 3DS camera find Magnagate play must round object work find valid round object screen light push button setup dungeon play Pignite Servine explore 5 floor dungeon items find sent main game youre done dungeon also saves list within mode revisit later like good go person minutes killYou also make Gifts give Pokemon make join team take steep requirements make cost 300 P plus materials make Pokemon want make Pokemon require 1000 P like Eevee Emolga perhaps starters sure makes Emolga specialYou also rewarded special gifts like Water gift given Water Pokemon downside use evolved Pokemon turn time gift fail get back try use later different Pokemon gift system could better thoughDLCThis game number DLC maps pay must pay expensive went ahead bought see buy ones allow get Pikachu friends easier dont care got ones add bit gameThis game handles DLC wrong way forces play dungeons free get past MD games buy 99 floor dungeon game one unlocked found DLC add finished game add unfinished game Still want get means get cheap add gameIN CONCLUSIONThe game bad feel game far weakest Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series story game lackluster long story main reason play spin Pokemon game 3 hours total gameplay game taken cut scenes game suffers simplification giving really powerful Pokemon removing hunger aspect game big deal dungeon crawler overhaul IQ skill system attack strength system means every Pokemon always good without training Even Pokemon dont get used gain EXP forced large amount items times deal games random elements punished harshly lose run Reviver Seed healing items enemy Pokemon last Reviver Seed Oran BerryThe game great job music graphic also fall love characters would normally respect gain new appreciation Gurdurr character one develop others MD series good job Pokemon models could better animations tend blocky times feel better using 3d models Pokedex 3D Pro game game models look bad compared almost feels like game rushed people consider game filler wait X YThe lack Pokemon game also huge deterrent players Pokemon game like players play spin Pokemon games see favorite Pokemon interact would main series game forces players largely use 85 percent Black White Pokemon little options Pokemon older generations game appeals Pokemon players generation big deal players like ruin games replay valueRATINGWith said rate game solid510 Like said game feel finished lacks lot made past MD games great would recommend game anyone grew generation lack Pokemon offered game makes hard sale hardcore Pokemon fan game looks sounds great thats would recommend game MD series anyone would Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers Sky game offers much one Sky IMO strongest series game looks great perfect difficulty everything makes dungeon crawling fun GtI game seems made get quick buck personally think 3540 price range extremely high unfinished game forces buy DLC somewhat experience past MD game game 20 bucks offered exclusively 3DS WareThanks taking time read
2013-05-14T03:33:08-0700,honest didnt get far game getting bored going something interesting may go back probably temporary diversion XY come outCan review Pokmon Conquest next Thats went game
2013-05-14T05:03:40-0700,may review game dont remember much best sure
2013-05-14T13:26:23-0700,didnt problems Monster houses Pokemon eating items often also found dungeon played partner one easiest gameI playing Axew may helpedBut agree Street Pass completely unnecessary
2013-05-13T01:15:57-0700,level moves AbilityJust curious since kinda collecting league Pokemon Black 2Have others far
2013-05-13T02:42:42-0700,Level 55Multiscale abilitymove setSafegaurdDragon RushExtreme SpeedWing AttackNo held itemFront Page example build single battle use Dragonite would like check
2013-05-13T21:09:03-0700,ThanksI dont really battle Pokemon except trainers game
2013-04-21T19:33:20-0700,confirmed true prance around like fairyIf contest stuff supposed dress pokemon going dress fairy type hockey gear call RockWhat said false
2013-04-21T21:36:16-0700,true kinda expect name change Magic Light something US Fairy doesnt seem quite fit going new type Xerneas Fairy type particular doesnt seem fit
2013-04-21T21:44:02-0700,Agreed think Light Fairy Im hoping Jigglypuff becomes new type Jigglypuff definitely Normal
2013-04-21T21:58:31-0700,yugioh fairy TCG version OCG angelI dont know going work TCG though really really hope new type new type dont make use energy dont need 8They could make 18 types pokemon TCG still use basic 8 energy types saw water card used grass energy Megalo Cannon
2013-04-21T22:13:59-0700,matters Video Game world Like poison uses psychic energy fairy would normal type
2013-04-21T22:51:11-0700,Adding new type would create balance issues would think Maybe remove type normal together replace could work 4 gens new types added 650 pokemon may unbalance game
2013-04-22T00:31:32-0700,discussion Mewtwos new form clone eventually person proven right highly doubt Pokemon going announce obnoxious new type Magic Light franchises types think Pokemon might announce new type actually going better name Magic Light also think Sylveon Pokemon revealed might new type doubt Xerneas Yveltal new types would look completely unnatural Pokemon Ive played since Pokemon first came pattern Ive found Pokemon like keep things simple possible makes easier easier us agree vaporeons statement Pokemon messed completely got rid normal type new type WOULD screw game Like cant imagine Pokemon like Bravery Ursaring MagicLightFairy type imagine normal typed Pokemon different type Another thing go argument keeps going guys thinking youre going right topic probably end right likely reason Sylveon looking much different could first permanent female Eeveelution like Froslass Vespiquen way Sylveon stays Normal type Pokemon typing doesnt become complicated
2013-04-22T01:00:20-0700,could please drop elitist attitude matter right wrong
2013-04-22T01:07:48-0700,obvious new type pokemon called Newtype anyone watched Gundam
2013-04-22T07:12:29-0700,right wrong argue point think im right believe strongly dont tell people wrong im rightPlus public forum input always welcome would boring place people allowed post always right sources back
2013-04-22T08:36:43-0700,think would make complete sense new type called Light Weve Dark type longest time need Light balance could make Xerneas Yveltal Light Dark respectively
2013-04-22T08:56:43-0700,think Ill go play YuGiOh Pokemon somehow decides call new type light YuGiOh type called light goes call new type Magic Pokemon decides bash head call new type fairy Ill probably join bashing head
2013-04-22T09:06:10-0700,Wait Youre going go play another game instead Pokemon pokemon dares similar type name game Especially thingslike thishave existed whileFirst lol nonono
2013-04-22T09:36:13-0700,card game Light Pokemon Neo Destiny wouldnt complete stretchDrew
2013-04-22T09:51:06-0700,Thats breaking pointAt first going explain areas overlap two games taxonomical systems instead Ill point going worried Id worried aspects Pokmon seem lineup YuGiOh powerful oneperdeck cards potent high rarity cards shape formatOtherwise think getting LightMagicFairyWhatever Type badThe actual YuGiOh TCG opposed depicted fiction beforehand originally six elementalstyle Attributes Dark Earth Fire Light Water Wind Cards divided 20 TypesTribesFamilies Aqua Beast BeastWarrior Dinosaur Dragon Fairy Fiend Fish Insect Machine Plant Pyro Reptile Rock Sea Serpent Spellcaster Thunder Warrior WingedBeast ZombieAs wasnt enough kind redundant places next PsychicType added long time mangaanimvideo game Divine Attribute Divine Beast Type began showing actual cards even Type called Creator God exists asingle cardI even objecting jumping ship jump ship something better job worse lol
2013-04-22T15:50:32-0700,OK maybe reacting would like new type cooler name Magic Fairy Light Pokemon decide release new type names would hope new type Light way would make lot sense since DarkI dont think getting new type bad would like something Magic Fairy Im actually OK idea new type Light makes lot sense Dark really didnt need give lecture YuGiOh played Pokemon YuGiOh 2 years ago quit YuGiOh Trust Im going change games joking changing games Im still serious fairy type partYoure mistaken Light Pokemon whole history Pokemon TCG decks called Light Dark back Neo destiny Pokemon types
2013-04-22T16:39:56-0700,must say balance types game unbalanced dont see obvious oversight many people complain types balanced add new one basis absolutely clue balance Isnt obvious work make sure things balancedBesides stand theory Mewtwo gets additional type new form either makes resistant Bug type SE Bug Otherwise Mewtwo get stomped 5 Bug types considering weakness
2013-04-22T18:27:23-0700,Adding new type wouldnt provide balance type chart already incredibly unbalanced begin Fairy abstract ridiculous idea type dont know would able quantify existing nerfed types strong even somehow think adding another type would balance reasons
2013-04-22T18:48:07-0700,completely agree Pokemon need new type adding new type called Fairy completely retarded thing Im trouble understanding youre calling type chart unbalanced opinion type chart well balanced moment really wish Pokemon making us chase tails Sylveons type wont add new type unfortunately since Pokemon hasnt revealed Sylveons type yet four generations since new type added likely Pokemon add new type wish new type retarded type Fairy Magic
2013-04-22T19:08:01-0700,types bit unbalanced dont think adding new type going make worse Look Dark Steel think better added types seems like difficult concept people understand add many types want still able balance poor argument IMO
2013-04-22T19:12:25-0700,word note Dark type Pokemon like Dark type franchises Dark element franchises relate actual darkness opposite light night Ghosts zombies undead usually dark elementIn Pokemon undead pokemon moves deal night ghost type Dark type pokemon spies covert operations theft played RPGs typical moves thief class would make would dark type moves PokemonSo opposite Dark type pokemon would type goes head front entrance strength types like normal fighting useless ghost type Dark type super effective goes back door ghost least likely expect moveThat TCG darkness pokemon really good discarding opponents cards type steals things
2013-04-22T19:55:33-0700,Ive also heard Dark type considered dirty fighting might explain Darktype moves like Bite Faint Attack Foul Play Fake tears Taunt Fighting types supereffective Dark types looked upon pure fighters beat dirtyfighting Dark typesFighting types already opposite Dark Light type type goes head counter Dark doesnt make sense think would make confusing
2013-04-22T20:19:53-0700,think Fairy typing unlikely dont see would bad make anything would fairly interesting see actual fairies mythology rather unique balancing perspective could see similar traits dragons weaknesses resistances mixed aroundIve always found idea Light typing relatively silly Ive never seen real potential actual Pokemon concepts could adopt without appearing forced fairy typing hand could interesting potential fair number Pokemon already draw similar mythos ie Chandelure willowisps Plus franchise thats Dragons Ghosts Psychics since inception think itd fit right inI dont find overwhelmingly likely Id open idea personally
2013-04-22T20:24:32-0700,Balance sometimes best odd number used varietys sake Ex rock paper scissorsIf decide bring new type would hope keep type coverage odd number personally think odds better favor completing balanced circle nothing poweringNow far balanced goes think balance types good sits issue see game unbalanced actual number Pokemon specific type Water Pokemon highest attendence Dragon type short end dealIf anything abilities base stats total number count types balance needs adjustedTake Legendaries mini legendaries choices know Pokemon battle worthy competitive levelEach Pokemon design purpose sure battle worthy way looking add balance video game mean IMO focus adding Pokemon boost numbers rarely playednever used types add abilites open doors optionsIf Gamefreak decided add another types might bit sad honestly think areas Pokemon roster could use great boost adding usable Pokemon competitive levels playI would happy games getting restructure roster ability side Pokemon bit iffy new type added unless 2 new types would hope less populated Pokemon types gain severe gain higher quality base stated battle worthy Pokemon sake adding needed balance
2013-04-22T20:25:33-0700,dont see whats wrong new type adds depth game bad thing peoples eyes
2013-04-22T20:29:50-0700,think people think bad lack certain typesNotice gen 12 dark steel typesNow everything feel playing certain catch dual dark steelsomethingI think make new type whole lot balancing order might enrage fans lotLike collecting electric type pokemon sudden rotom switched light typeId probably pull hair
2013-04-22T20:33:37-0700,Red Blue Gold LeafgreenI might get back videogames new mewtwo thing
2013-04-22T20:36:43-0700,Pokemontrader Agreed idea Pokemon getting new type easily accept new form think would cool say Dragonite suddently became new typeOriginal original change good keeping roots foundation holds something kept building upon moving forward Sure repair patch keep original secure
2013-04-22T20:46:02-0700,addition adding Dark Metal game unbalance felt needed give types better worse matchups also made unique pokemon designs typing also making things like hidden power usefulThe problem see adding new type 650 pokemon later new type would pretty much exclusive gen 6 Im fairly confident sylveon would normal types shares many traits normal type pokemon argument sakes lets say new type type light dont really consider fairy type element Sylveon would Pokemon type revealed Lets say light type bad match dark bad matchup Pokemon based stat total 600 means light type would unbalanced Pokemon fairly advantage itAdding new type would create issue unless go back redesign every Pokemon Gen 6 know wont current track record BW think need work balancing Pokemon first increasing based stats older Pokemon compensate power creep make Flareon better better support 394 attack stat etc adding new types game Also changing Pokemon types take away whats special
2013-04-22T20:49:16-0700,Youre mistaken inNeo Destinywe got 20 Pokmon Light names intended balance Dark Pokmon confused DarknessTypes originally introduced theTeam Rocketexpansion also featured inNeo DestinyIf believe simply go Researching Tower switch Unlimited version pull theNeo DestinysetThe Type system Pokmon odd cant tell started classical elements started adding classical elements cultures started adding things struck fancy end result within Type Pokmon Type because1 manipulate element2 live element3 composed partially wholly element4 one aboveThat applies Types resemble elements FightingType doesnt fit instead FightingType apparently FightingType least vaguely humanoid cant even focus might considered Fighting techniques chi manipulation much overlap TypesIt irksome apparently knowing throw karate chop FightingType equal utilizing natural venoms PoisonType equal channeling power elements anything resembling elemental Type equal tapping power mind soul equal wings time FlyingTypeThere also Types feel pretty redundant like Rock Ground could EarthType possibly GrassTypes One also needs realize Type system pretty arbitrary begin often using video game elemental logic instead would actually happen equalequivalent Types faced
2013-04-22T20:57:24-0700,Really quote post LINK light pokemon tcg card STILL make ridiculous statement
2013-04-22T21:24:18-0700,terrible several things really unbalanced Steel resisting like twelve types course obvious one also hate Poison strong one type seven types resist Grass Ice one resistance Dragon bunch random elemental resistances resisted one type Water basically one actual weakness due Grass undesirable offensive typeevery Water Pokemon learning Ice Beam combat anywayPersonally Ive always disagreed notion Dark Steel necessary types balance Psychic broken RBY number reasons would fixed time namely fact Ghost moves glitch RBY made Psychic immune Ghosttype moves anyway good Bug Pokemon Bugtype moves fact Psychic caused 30 Special drop Special incorporated two different stats really didnt need create specific types nerf Psychics especially process made Steel ridiculously overpowered

2013-04-23T10:54:15-0700,Things like Entry Hazards Weather teams made metagame stale last years way GameFreak alter metagame point nerf Entry Hazards Weather abilities Hopefully Fairy make game fresh giving players options work unique winning strategies know mean
2013-04-23T14:44:31-0700,Yeah little weird thiis big deal sudden always way never really thought anything since dont get whats bad little odd game isIn Gen 2 6 since 1st introduced Pokemon still beginning really theres dozens Im sure Xy thing happenAnd would anyone care Rotom light type like doesnt make sense Nobody going stop playing going live keep playing Thats close minded say oh well im going play anymore changed type sounds like mindless complaint name change best
2013-04-23T15:11:48-0700,isnt suddenly big deal First foremost came extension discussion Second annoyance Gen 1 longer remains problem becomes original games original Game Boy restrictive console develop games DS near limiting excuse keeping cluttered system retaining mechanic makes game worse usually good idea abandon itNow say dont get bad fine dont know adequately explain already without derailing thing everyone takes issue things
2013-04-23T15:48:59-0700,also bigger deal age internet never released information Pokemon like showing image know Sylveon normal type characteristics wigglytuff new type brings balance concerns big deal VG became recognizable TPI Pokemon taking Pokemon like training best new type creates balance problems VGC limits playing field EX Pokemon TCG VG decline well balance 800 pokemon
2013-04-23T16:03:23-0700,citation neededIts fact want fact
2013-04-23T16:49:06-0700,Ummyesyes Zekrom Reshiram unknown typings many fifth gen Pokemon upon first reveal reason Sylveon subject much speculation isnt immediately obvious breaks traditional naming conventions eevee family could mean somethingor time tellThere two major reasons problem One Pokemon intended competitive VGC part franchises appeal Pokemon intentions Stunfisk instance likely intended fun joke Two new type option unbalance add Fairy could great addition sure concerns comes change Also opinion things unbalanced decline Dont abuse declarative statements like beg

2013-04-23T17:04:32-0700,Thats opinion feel like things decline also opinion Pokemon value ultra rares Pokemon competitive completely subjective fact says opinion respect may think game good opinion think bad opinionYou two seem think say fact discussion add Everything speculation everything based opinion

2013-04-23T17:52:16-0700,get EX Pokemon making TCG bad would new type make VG bad People play VG Tier system community knows balance game pretty well 800 pokemon wouldnt get balanced since preevolutions means end dont think Nintendo going go back fix every Pokemon nature monsters going better othersAnd would new type bad doubt new type going dominate Tier single handedly dominate anything unless made really poorly
2013-04-23T17:55:51-0700,Let reiterate problem posts state opinion fact thus declarative statement comes across saying opinion correct may intend thats fairly simple interpretation add something like feel think often point might understood opposed polarizing

2013-04-23T18:27:12-0700,True like said idea new Types Weaknesses Resistances whole thread pure speculation point Also adding new Type like Fairy wouldnt nearly bad allowing every Pokemon know 6 moves instead 4 Someone mentioned thread earlier Pokemon intended competitive thats true ironically enough actually ways making Pokemon seem like arent competitive looks competitive Ive seen really good Lv 100 Magikarp entire team Legendaries YouTube Gen IV says alot

2013-04-24T08:20:33-0700,post things put words phrases like IMO think believe makes sound less mean would use another word nannybot open engagement rather closed make discussions present

2013-04-24T18:34:59-0700,Thats backed facts research scientist validate Pokemon TCG VG facts backed research speak people speak think may change game Nothing factual Pokemon Pokemon makes soIt almost universal know thing Sabldonk bad game would ruined next large tournament Nations Worlds think released statement say next format would HGSS tournament keep game balanced nutshellWe cant compare Pokemon official backing happens Heart Disease back research
2013-04-24T20:30:11-0700,Plus scientific facts end always true half time really opinion Theres lot things people claim true end complete oppositeRealistically theres truths world things end perspective Even science failed lot explaining things really work

2013-04-27T13:54:48-0700,saying would need balance new type work 650 Pokemon existing types
2013-04-29T04:54:27-0700,sure important balance pokemon moment Honestly cant see bringing new type would worth reworking current pokemon bring new type Id work current scheme things try slightly balance things However since Im player opinion mine counts consumer Personally Im fond record far terms introducing new types VG TCG Id taken away course introductions games gimmicky mostly awkward somewhat painful hope dont introduce new type However Id continue play VG regardless

2013-03-11T00:12:11-0700,highly recomending using PP tournies Sometimes certain moves need extra boost count battles opposing attacks abilities chance missing reduce chances hit hard needing Attacks like Fire Blast better 8 vs 5 battle case reasons stated IMO Attack 15 PP doesnt need boost 10 PP Attacks might less 10 boost case Move set build weather like Sunny Day see reason boost thoseJust weigh Move needs much boost need battle consider long battle might last judge much boost PP count

2013-02-18T02:07:37-0800,kinda like Ultimate Predator Ultimate Warrior kinda thing Pokemon styleIf wanted make official sort thing would love bring expertise Ive got table mean would definition 1v1singles kind situation thats best
2013-02-18T02:32:19-0800,yeah think would work way get players understand building Pokemon knowing facing battle Even though one built building one purposefully defeat way make weaknesses base stat wise advantage move set wise offenseI dont know exactly yet want set looking see even interest base allSide note Mewtwo win hands lol hay one faves personal opinion lol plus Team R
2013-02-18T07:41:44-0800,like idea gonna Pokemon Showdown XD
2013-02-18T07:57:16-0800,cool idea dont mewtwo gensect frownnonono
2013-02-18T10:34:25-0800,adhere much idea sticking two Pokemon pure 1v1 battle itd kinda boring Mewtwo vs Genesect thing Mewtwo autowins cause higher base Speed give hidden power fire something wouldnt want actually perform counterbuilds much know really judging onwhat criteria contest Speed really determines lot matchup two Pokemon Speed isnt deciding factor usually something else small like type advantage coverage moves enough sheer tankiness power respond kind
2013-02-18T11:08:20-0800,Would factor things like Pokemon fly
2013-02-18T13:49:26-0800,sure yet mechanics Thus idea reaching every one try figure system show strengths Pokemon
2013-02-18T17:38:38-0800,IMO go lore behind two rather actual mechanics like say animestyle fight Otherwise like Kayle said Mewtwo going barbeque Genesect Flamethrower something
2013-02-18T21:55:13-0800,guarantee beat Mewtwo Genesect real 1v1 battle anyone Someone hacks course
2013-02-18T22:14:16-0800,would really like know Mewtwo win even play grounds something dont know
2013-02-18T23:36:21-0800,Interesting see talking also like idea lore part ideaI seeknow way Genesect defeat Mewtwotherefore good reason look idea become optional activity comparisons againstbetween Pokemon
2013-02-18T23:47:53-0800,PM strategy Im 100 positive exists least one Mewtwo set mathematically guarantee beat literally Genesect pure 1v1 without baton pass additional setupOn one hand fact say kind defeats purpose idea terms pure game mechanics Pablos actually something maybe weve got lot talk thoughtWhile lore interesting place turn dont really way generate statistics given Pokemons power except game lot fun TV shows similar theme actually research show comprehensively tough warriorsanimalsetc dont think Pokemon interested maintaining coherent canonical hierarchy
2013-02-18T23:56:37-0800,type death matches put contenders common ground would EV spreads relateable items items natures etc talking Choice Scarf set well also put Mewtwo scarf well hes talking super effective reduction items score KO Mewtwo well also give one Mewtwo Mewtwo win almost setups flamethrowerfire blast speed advantage biggest weapon Mewtwo Genosects 4x weakness fire justiceWell use Mewtwos strengths Genosects strengths put plain thats attack first Mewtwo smart hell find way Im sure
2013-02-19T01:06:28-0800,Well Im talking purely mechanics actual video games Pokemon lore Anyways really complicated mas SP Bug Buzz almost always guaranteed OHKO Mewtwo without SpDHP EVs invested standard SpeedSpA holding Focus Sash Genesect would always win due priority move learns Quick Attack Mewtwo learns noneA Bug attack reducing berry would nullify even Genesect could physical based used Bug Bite instead nullify item able finish Mewtwo Bug Bite Quick Attack guess went ahead didnt know Genesects base stats last post found SpA Att base stats lackluster uberOh well wouldve fun see people try anything berry surprised kod Quick Attack
2013-02-19T01:29:37-0800,thinking X Scissor Quick Attack Focus Sash fully look technical aspects run post itAlso Pablo Iwas going challange battle yet get Bug Attack reduction berry BW2 first thing thought Mewtwo hold Genesect Quick Attack
2013-02-19T01:47:15-0800,actually didnt realize Genesect priorityBut still disappointingly simple examine
2013-02-19T04:50:56-0800,think Mewtwo could take Genosect Mewtwo telekenesis abilities could form barriers block Genosects attacks hurdle machinery boulders Genosect Genosect may quick able transform robotic car looking thing think Mewtwos intense strength telekensismental abilities would net winI havent see Genosect combat yet perhaps intense strength could break Mewtwos barriers deal big damage Mewtwo
2013-02-20T15:33:48-0800,admit decent amount interest lets try figure way could work comparing Pokemon bit statsmove sets loreI open suggestions simply idea trying get participation ideas battle building Pokemon tournaments game play get best use Pokemon cancan doThoughts
2013-02-20T20:46:58-0800,worth toss Quick Claw well break normal rules also XD
2013-02-21T14:54:51-0800,think go route VG youre going get right answer almost alwaysWho wins Charizard Venusaur Well Venusaur low SP DEF Charizard easily attack Flamethrower always oneshot Venusaur fictious VG talkThat kind stuff get old quickly opinion takes fun think fun question seeing Pokemon tv show Pokemon would winCharizard could pick Venusaur flying spinarooni toss attack think seismic throw Venusaur use vines grip rocks ground stop Charizards attack Venusaur use Sleep Power kinds Powders slow Charizard Charizard could use wings blow powders scattered across air away sunny day Charizard Venusaur feel strong Venusaur able shoot constant Solar Beams Charizard dodge air deliver final Flame Blast KOSee little imagination produce LOL maybe likes kind stuff
2013-02-21T17:12:24-0800,way see becoming sort gameSay example say Dragonite Kingdra face offBoth Pokemon say 200 Hit pointsA person canthen post attack way actual attack form lore thus reducing Pokemons Hit Points 10An example lore attack would Kingdra hide water ocean Dragonite attacks using Wings sepporate water Hit Kingdra Dragon Pulse Thus Kingdra loses 10 Hit PointsPlayers need defend continue attacks onto Pokemon One Knocked OutThere room imagination also use specific attacks learn gamesI sure though guys thinkMaybe also way dodge attack well would posting restriction like wait 5 posts post againHow sound
2013-02-22T02:38:52-0800,look Deadliest Warrior show take many different variables side test put 1000 different fights using data see would win battle make system like work
2013-02-22T16:12:10-0800,huh interesting really looking make big data alone would time comsuming think interaction members best bet including bit flavor interesting see pans outMore thoughts
2013-02-22T16:46:05-0800,Perhaps best 3 match Pokemon Anime TCG Video Game Whoever wins 2 matches wins whole thing Anime would purely subjective TCG kind multiple cards Pokemon Video Game would pretty straightforward
2013-02-22T16:49:53-0800,Combining 3 aspects would cool make battle game sort thingI still tossing around ideas head sure full result idea mechanicsI liking feed back ideas coming though Keep coming
2013-02-22T22:26:11-0800,Anime seems hardest Id start discussing first
2013-02-22T23:58:40-0800,Agreed Anime considered would need research episodes Pokemon Moviesand Anime magazinesI familure Magazinecomic book anime rather easy find episodes get ideas info
2013-02-23T11:54:09-0800,way see Anime would subjective almost could done poll TCG would least subjective itd least data figure equation figure winner Video Game would middle ground moveset equip item EVIV could affect matchup seems pretty wellrounded would give everyone someway support PokemonI like idea threetiered system finding stronger Pokemon means Pokemon cant dominate every matchup overpowered TCG card hand Pokemon could weak TCG versions look strong Anime quite decent Video Game enough squeak win competition
2013-02-26T11:06:05-0800,definitly want turned poll going VG statsmove pool simply put catagory statsI certain TCG seen powerfull cards type cards give take Pokemon poorgreatawesome cards formatI know Manga stuff research research one wants use Manga Anime wellSo combination aspects use make battle happen 1 Pokemon win regardless specific things like VG stats perhaps could make story based gameNo matter player game gets information say going VG statsmove pool could post story line type attack favor Pokemon would like see win battleI could figure good attack system worth specific amount hit point draining player could post attack based source lore VG manga ect add battles story player would wait 5 postings making another attackAs far story goes battle would battle written resources PokemonTake example Kingdra vs DragoniteA player post something likeDragonite circling Kindra waiting open chance hit Kingdra well charged Hyper beam Kingdra hid water Kingdra surfaced fast water Dragonite barrle rolled left let loose hyper beam targetting Kingdra back causing Kingdra make face plant waterHyper beam Dragonite 200 Kingdra 190Next posterIn favor DragoniteDragonite new needed rest moment attack Kingdra yet resurfaced retaliate Dragonite landed near rock formation analyze next possible move resting rocks could see fast moving shadow speeding towards surface water Dragonite ready anything arched wings way back prepaired launch wing attack water split Kingdra leaping water hydro pump attack Dragonite quickly closed wings front reflecting water away torso Kingdra drew near leap water attack complete Dragonite flapped wings outward Kingdra causing Kingdra splash hard back depths waterWing attack Dragonite 200 Kingdra 180Next poster time favor Kingdra blah blah blah Ink blot TCG Dragonite 190 Kingdra 180I think guys see saying long elements source far Pokemon goesnothing crazy like Kingdra used AK47 think would cool something like way game way part story many ways legit Pokemon scenarios draw make battle interesting long people post source attack like VG manga anime TCG cool everyone sort combining different parts Pokemon merchandisefranchiseSo something like
2013-02-27T07:31:52-0800,example feels little much fanfiction enough utilization actual data matches allowed go route nothing stopping Pokemon winning shouldnt Certain Pokemon clear advantages others true Video Game sometimes TCG sometimes completely true AnimeTake matchup Dragonite vs Kingdra using Kingdra would using Ice attacks Dragonite weak using Dragonite Id use Dragon attacks Kingdras weakness would wise take account VG base stats Pokemon also include Anime possibilities like Kingdra diving water Dragonite flying high Im sure utilize TCG herePerhaps Anime could work randomizer Every attack Pokemon x chance activate Anime Cutscene allows Pokemon perform dodge perform super effective attackItd nice TCG could factor somehow
2013-02-27T10:12:49-0800,Factoring TCG would like using attack card one Pokemon Take set one Pokemon TCG attacks always VG relatedFan fictionanimemanga could add flavor text allows creativity battlesVG statsadvantages TCG sort follows catored fit balance card game like weakness notThus looking combine elements one brawl depend choice player making postA randomizer effect anime element battle could work bonus factor making battles realistic feel battles dodging super effective attackA good amount things take see produce resources available battle determin Pokemon win VG effects critical hits hold item boosts ect
2013-02-27T11:18:50-0800,Im beginning see resemblance RP tournaments top head sounds like far much work might helpful leadRP roleplaying tournaments understand work follows world created administrators something small basic plot elements basic summary proposed prospective players players nominate existing characters certain media sometimes restricted sometimes roleplay characters new environmentPlayers stuck predesigned combat system everyone considered equal dont know much system something posting posting well incharacter gives points use using points well gives additional points use points attack players dont actually damage give points end youre rated based many points haveWith Pokemon posts would shorter character isnt factor really trick would trying enforce system would easily understood without inhibiting peopleDistracted idea made sense
2013-03-05T14:13:37-0800,made sense Kayle know speaking sure needs extreme far amount work involved something thatConsidering come system think would need perhaps look battle system uses three aspects battlesIn game statsAnimeFictionalStill back burner far battle system couldwould work want simple stattyping battle gets super technical
2013-03-05T17:32:05-0800,dont know use game stats Pokemon justice Pidgeot fly mach 2 speeds 1500 MPH base speed game 91 306 nature252 EV fastest Pokemon game strongest based fact alone
2013-03-06T11:50:07-0800,Pidgeot almost always free retreat TCG ridiculously fast Anime average speed wise video game think overall fair treatment feel important include three sides franchise compliment others strengths weaknesses
2013-03-06T16:43:03-0800,could generate attack system give specific amounts damage based source attack came ie TCG VG Anime Pokedex entryI could also implament way recovery based factors sourceHow sound

2013-02-10T16:16:12-0800,wish Nintendo would take IVs game together ton competitive players RNGing sole reason affect IVs invisible mechanic game shows mechanic waste everyones time failed mechanicI guess someone hope XY IV mechanic
2013-02-10T16:28:38-0800,say agree need RNGd Pokemon win Skill hand another topic RNG skill
2013-02-10T23:26:20-0800,hope make Pokemon stronger past gens X far IVs go never fan hidden value game Game Freak make Pokemon unique lot wrong Pokemon games main series need fixed hope Pokemon game bold enough take series new direction
2013-02-11T09:32:44-0800,Hope make Pokemon strongerThe power creep alreadyI skimmed Kinda sad elam went embarrassed calling RNGing cheating vast majority playerbase disagrees ways obtain perfectcompetitive Pokemon thatwidely considered cheating involves hacking game cartridge directly altering data RNGing thatRNG trackingabuse toe weird line though arent actually altering game data still manipulating weaknesses systems much different using Missingno glitch gen 1 duplicate master balls saying caught every Pokemon legitimately sort kind circumvented intended system examples also still challenges face getting correct moves RNGd Pokemon example EV training itI think definite statement someone make whether RNGing cheating RNG Pokemon bring tournament staff arent going care think thats much ask forIf want talk isnt fair thats another story contend youre consistently losing RNGd Pokemon probably going consistently lose nonRNGd Pokemon played person cause hes probably better player Oh wellEdit one discussed works yet far see Ill try summarizeComputers incapable generating random numbers Theyjust make number top head way based something programmers clever come bizarre mathematical functions produce wildly different numbers depending input give called PRNGs pseudorandom number generators Pokemon uses PRNG generating essentially every random factor game direction NPCs walk pokemon encounter tall grass IVs much damage moves doSome people able study code experimentation figure PRNG based since based something know PRNG takes input know itwith input predict input actions required get result want case would mean hatching egg perfect nearperfect IVs actual method remember right involves changing time DS mashing way opening sequence fast humanly possible thats Gen 4 dont remember changed Gen 5 think got easier
2013-02-11T10:17:34-0800,Well said make older Pokemon stronger allfor example maybe giving new evolutions older ones making useless Pokemon like Farfetchd least passably usable one cared Golbat example could evolve Crobat Togetic getting TogekissIm gonna stay debate though like Prime said IVs would kinda nice would also sort anyways eliminate general cheating using means acquire perfect Pokemon basically came 31 IVs would also kill vague sense getting unique different Pokemon nothing added bothersome competitive side gives Pokemon unique flavor suppose people dont care
2013-02-11T15:53:43-0800,view RNG abuse game used RNG generate Pokemon make unique one Pokemon IVs EVs related factors suppose hidden values player never suppose see themknow themAbusing RNG viewed cheating even program game gaming system meant used players cheating Well need use external software track random events done hacking game see Random Number Generators code programmed RNG byproduct hacking game use RNG method way youcheatingI feel way programs like PokSAV Pokegen let directly see Pokemons data viewed cheating youre playing game way intended intended know Pokemons IVs EVs well trainers SID use RNG PokSAVPokegen tools improve game Ive also talk VGC players use save editorsRNG think far players concern long Pokemon exist game legitKeep mind numbers dont always matter still need able use team best stats still lose everyone mixed feelings
2013-02-11T15:56:50-0800,Perhaps taking away IV system would allow Natures dominate outcome stats maxed applying EV points boost stats wanting max outIf Pokemon Base stats already stat suffer able hit max without EVdSay Adamant TTar EV train max attack invest Defense stat well reason stats even hit bare maximum stat without invest EVs allMaybe way reverseEV Pokemons statsIt could work something like thisTake Adamant TTar EVs invest 510 would like stat invest simply go max go past max invest statThen could reverse EV stat lower Base stat maxs atYou could 120 Base stat lowering EVs make Pokemon slower required use 120 reverse EVs order balance fairness non EV raised statsMaybe even mech every 3 say Attack stat Special attack stat go 1Either way idea whole reason behind IVs two Pokemon unique one supposably different others allows one built make best use want built Special attacker physical defense Physical attacker Special Defense ectSo Pokemon reaches Base stat EVs boosted EV investment max stat stats max Base stat without EV investmentI think something need change although Breeding give 4 31 IVs sort 100 control unless RNG say get Zero example speedI think able reduce speed stat way form reverse EVingJust thoughts

2013-01-05T19:28:59-0800,New Eeveelutions would confirm gen 6 since add 2 new one every gen soon gen 6 though
2013-01-06T06:28:43-0800,Morimoto appearing rarely resulted newsIm guessing news slated 8th

2012-12-15T12:09:59-0800,Seems like Nintendo going stall release traditional Pokemon game 3DS release second party games instead
2012-12-15T15:07:48-0800,anything would like see Pokemon game 3DS interact Wii well likely WiiU hopefully boost sales everything going move forward

2012-12-11T13:05:34-0800,way allowing Pokemon able participate VGC cool would need restriction many legendaries could team 6 say 2 able use 1 battleThis would nice since VGC scene seen repetitive used teamsPokemon

2012-11-27T17:13:34-0800,Hey got idea thread reading recent editorial post pokebeach Ive actually thinking along lines Well perhaps pokemon seemed rush generation door honest Im sure mind overly cute pokemon last batch opinion Yes like latest set games Black White 2 fact opinion best pokemon games produced far However opinion things missing would really set games Use new 3DS system would make great changes brand bringing ability streamline online playability Thatll certainly help kinds changes would like see games themselvesIn copy Black 2 Ive already put almost 200 hours remember playing 900 hours Sapphire yet Im certainly done fooling around Im sure many even put way hours Ive went pokemon league thats unusual since games Ive went least 50 times per game Ive got 1 pokemon level 100 3 90s normally quite Ive completed Unova dex though havent caught yet However Im far away think need 70 give take Theres lot see gameyet theres still something missing Id like opportunity see cross species breeding would produce imagine cool combos could produced Currently along 28 Unowns total 676 different pokemon right Sure species pokemon dont breed would leave enough variety new generation games perhaps even current full size game consoles could handle Even limit breeding within egg groups variety would enough satisfy anyones interest new pokemon new abilities stats interesting cool new looks Id certainly hard time putting hey consider Spinda maybe even varieties looks within varieties Personally think would coolSo agree Would like see type game would like see new generation pokemon games
2012-11-27T17:23:57-0800,like idea cross breeding looks get degree game design plan making Pokemon game breeding system going allow breed abilities attacks stat rank well bunch cool stuff legendaries going breedable well Articunos learn Thunderbolt breading generation Pokemon like ZapdosIt lot work fun training
2012-11-27T18:12:41-0800,Personaly id like storyline makes sense main character become part conflict biggest problems evil teams create isnt repition increasingly crazy dedication members designs motives Team Aqua get blatant events happening around character NPCs force intoLooking Pokemon Gold Silver instance imagine much sense would make play Silver dad rocket boss wouldnt need anything diary small speech wanting live fathers shadow gym challenge would arbitrary usual least interaction Team Rocket would make senseOr Pokemon Black White 2 playing N determined right wrongs brought defeat new wave Team Plasma stand selfish desires already shows big boss fight anyway crying loudI feel BW2 certainly introduced welcome changes starting big city new locations Pokedex feature feels like really perfecting mechanics want see story arch game work bit main characters hard time forcing newest games time everything grinding fetch quests brings tot second thing id reaaaaally liek seeAdventure game style mini games Theyve tried gimmicky minor plot battle systems like PokeWood Musicals Frontier Battle Tower Contests none really stuck want see areas enter things get bit control Like instance Bug Catching contest get first person view scramble get best Pokemon racing contestants Like mix Pokeatholon Bug Catching contest ideas perspective change mix things make use HM moves interactive actually letting surf fly hack away treesNow obviously may bit much ask DS even 3DS comes would really thing make title titles want game main series game available played WiiU WiiU pad 3DS Pokemon one biggest sellers Nintendo time really pushed new title systems Mario horribely abused consol transitions almost alwasy beign remakes though Paper Mario 2 looks cool think increased power system needs put use may much ask one game accesed different platforms savingsbundle package allows play 3DS version WiiU version leastThe WiiPad makes lot sense lower screen DS Pokemon games allow keep charm increasing graphics making usability something simple Bag pretty cool also lot potential reshaping way battles preformed still recognie thata full WiiU version alienate long time fans portable version takes away convience way another game want ont WiiU work would take think could get away maing new story exsisting regionsAnd ofcourse want Pokemon Snap 2 WiiU makes much sense fact could include ti main series game give character Camera would soooooo cool darnit
2012-11-27T18:31:51-0800,Ah good Im one whos thought Im sure long time players like Vaporeon might even tide us especially play game competitvely well Id like go gusto also breed new odd looks new cross breeds well dont think Id ever get tired checking new formes though given chance Anyone else ideas theyd like see future new generation gamesEdit Shino youve got great ideas Actually work hacking away trees Racing contestants pokemon snap yeah definitely Maybe even show levels attacks like much powerful attack pokemon level 50 level 10
2012-11-27T21:28:48-0800,problem crossbreeding gets way hand fast Take Field egg group example Im counting right 90 Pokemon lines group Ditto makes 91 line effect Pokemon instance breeding Spoink gives pearl head would 4000 combinations lines possible would custom front back sprite fully animated member evolutionary lineAnd oh yeah cant forget shininess every one 4000 combinations TWO sets sprites one normal one shinyBut wait gender differences gender variants would need FOUR sets sprites Male normal male shiny female normal female shinyAnd thats one egg groupIts since took Statistics class wont go though effort calculating everything Suffice say entire cartridge would stuffed full sprites would room yknow game saying wouldnt fun see logistically nightmare Maybe Gen 1 would possible many Pokemon theres way
2012-11-28T05:01:07-0800,Yes Im sure logistically might challenging understand 3DS still working cartridges right Whats stop making larger cartridge Whats current memory storage one carts anyway certainly dont idea maybe time memory capabilities get better anyway cross breeding would showcase best possible use opinionIf something like attempted think could even marketed pokemon breeders game dumb plot bit concentrating upon cross breeding aspect even future games next generation one dont memory keep sprites someone port pokemon didnt currently sprite memory couldnt game receive sprite data pokemon transferred new game matter cant game made sprite data made occasion production pokemon based original raw data current 676 breaking sections gen 1 pokemon crossbreeding gen 2 another game gen 3 another etc Breaking would bring even money pokemon creators since many us wanna ketchum Im sure ways get around objections little ingenuity active imagination would takes Oh years worth manhours programming well lol
2012-11-28T05:32:38-0800,PAMy idea iis make Pokemon game way raised grew take favorite monster train best push past limit become part lives put trust place trust back true partnership many events game reflect thatI planning giving attacks level level 10 surf lot better level 1 surf pokemon would gain AP would spend upgrading attacks abilities also plain way level system far restrictive place system Pokemon stat cap way players train use favorite Pokemon Every Pokemon give EVs AP place experience points get lot EVs like 5000 battle spend increase stats Youll go menu use points put required amount EV stat stat increase 1 point x depending Pokemons stat rankAs breeding side things Physical changes would hard design team Im sure color changes could put Like Vaporeon white ear fins yellow ones plan make every pokemon breed able give every pokemon gender differences male female form Zapdos lot planned game
2012-11-28T09:51:55-0800,Yeah thats another point like Currently games somewhat restrictive buy Sure shops BW2 allow buy attacks bringing number bluegreenredyellow shards corelation good playerbreedercollector everything lucky happen upon right shard lying around ability show good earning right receive certain attacks abilities would cool Good idea Vaporeon also like unlimited stat idea would definitely showcase talentAnother thing showcased another game berries Maybe Im bit farmer heart dont know perhaps thats breeding thing seemed hit would like idea growing producing berries well available ones showcase talent growing right mulch take care plants well better pokemon could get better crop berries perhaps multiple berries time maybe potent berries added effects could result better sim game many options current generation
2012-11-28T10:05:51-0800,Oh another thing game offer game services players buy items online store likely nintendo e shop Players make items poke balls ect put online store players need buy item go games online store like GTS items players put sell buy items also unique Im going make finish making item get rank good better rank effective item longer last use like battle items break higher rank longer lastThe thing also apply berries breed custom effect growing process done sell players use
2012-11-28T11:40:58-0800,OOOooo great ideas Right like Gives reason utilize online content showcases abilities wellHey ability import music 3DS slot micro SD card right able access music put card youre using game think would sooo cool Rockin tunes would much preferred boring pokemon music Hey dont get wrong pokemon music cool SMALL DOSES kinda wears ya Everyone style may coincide supplied music Personally shut speakers playing pokemon currentlyEdit One suggestion could also make game bit realistic showing long takes make particular attack Like Quick Attack Extreme Speed would almost instantaneous whereas maybe takes 5 seconds surf time takes build big wave make attacks land land instead turn based enough time get another shot opponents pokemon faint take shot second attack Sometimes may even get 3 4 shots pokemon able get one attack option turn turn based attacking would great Sometimes youd like crush pokemon fast sometimes speed pokemon might slower might want reinstate turn based play thought
2012-11-28T12:59:40-0800,Well game would maid Wii U future system online option play missions friends Im sure allowing use music game hard xbox 360 games allow itAs battle system taking away turn base system replacing free roam system players control Pokemon battle jump run walk dash block fly fly etc want way game focus much speed game focus stats wont dependent like DS games force players play using favorite Pokemon like game use wins highest statsI also going change stat buffers work well boost stat effect stay play 20 seconds go away Status effects like sleep go away Pokemon hit nothing game based turns time battle system really want get done plan game way Pokemon beIf also possible want release 2 versions game E rated version rated version players age group appreciate
2012-11-28T13:58:25-0800,wish knew program games could help type projectYeah considering pokemon geared primarily towards young people perhaps teen version would cool difficulty envisioning coming pass doubt pokemon would ever allow franchise get teen rating However opinion little consequence Im sure sell whatever sells well demand high times pokemon change

2012-06-13T10:07:05-0700,Final Fantasy Tactics unlike traditional FF games involved moving characters around battlefield like Pokemon Conquest attacks certain range starting classes character team could swap time like going Black Mage White Mage learn skills various classes would able access newer classes like Blue Mage Time Mage really fun game matches came placement battlefield classes brought battle

2012-07-09T13:26:43-0700,register pokemon something mean registering
2012-07-09T13:29:11-0700,Use warrior battle game registers warrior galleryI know evolve warlord register sure new linked Pokemon Pokemon evolve
2012-07-10T12:40:49-0700,Lightning gals storylineGinchyo something like used lot main storyline Luxray well Prinplup grabbed needed Water type one point like Joltikhad Oichi play instead Jigglypuff one use instead might easier used LuxrayLolI prefer get many warriors possible beat love battling Puglis though battlefield rocksBut finally beat Ranmaru got four kingdoms ownNow beat
2012-07-10T12:44:42-0700,Pugillis Avia awesome fended Kenshins Gallade Pugillis Magikarp Avia used Gracia Gothita Nobunagas Hydreigon
2012-07-10T12:49:07-0700,lold Magikarp must beeninterestingI usually Emolga PugillisOr least couple flying types get knocked get right back upAt moment cant remember kingdom Avia isI restart Lightning girls storyline Ranmarus army got strong defeatAt least would able defeat would give five minutes peace
2012-07-10T12:53:28-0700,Flying type Avia flying typeMagikarp Gallade 3 range AI tricked Magikarp running banner banner clockwise Gallade banner behind time ran
2012-07-10T21:17:39-0700,worksWhen protecting Crystellia usually Elmoga fly water corner wait time runs outprovided attackers dont flying type Im weak none moves hit
2012-07-12T18:57:25-0700,Protip want one Warlords beat one Warlords restrictions get one soldiers Early game thats damn near impossible doesnt really get easier get Warlords wing might get story dont know guys yet
2012-07-12T19:56:41-0700,think get Mister Rhyperrior Gallade story thats ones get cut scene Additionally dont believe get Warlords fight Nobunaga end Mr Infernape Mismagius Lapras Aggron recall maybe post story
2012-07-12T21:57:51-0700,cant get anyone Kenshin Shingen two mentioned warlords wander around beat didnt join
2012-07-13T04:26:25-0700,WiFi event get Motonari Motochika automatically helps lot getting Warlords
2012-07-13T18:07:40-0700,Quick random question start one downloaded episodes Specifically Motonari Motochika episode havent beaten game yet Im trying get couple actual Warlords rather ton Grunts Ive picked thus far
2012-07-13T19:31:44-0700,Motonari Motochika automatically join team main story additional episodes automatically unlock beat game found last pageAlso warlords well rank ups arent available start playing extra stories
2012-07-13T21:01:01-0700,Well finally managed hold copy ToysRUs couldnt buy since system whatever reason couldnt ring since 10 giftcard rang timeso yeah tomorrow thoughProbably spend giftcard cards something
2012-07-14T02:23:06-0700,Except yknow havent Yes Ive downloaded episode kinda need even half shot recruiting Shinx chick randomly showed radar month
2012-07-14T08:41:43-0700,downplay regular games Im enjoying way BW HGSS etcI hope make 2nd one Pokemon
2012-07-14T13:43:02-0700,got Ginchyo pretty easilyShe one earliest ones get isnt tough
2012-07-14T14:13:14-0700,tough part really positioning rather difficult recruit properly youve got two guys potentially recruit Eevee Jiggly Plus trying recruit 2 guys well rather annoying
2012-07-14T15:05:07-0700,Good point Though sort gave Eevee Jigglypuff half way didnt enough damage didnt want Eevee evolveThat knew could stop evolving
2012-07-14T15:23:23-0700,Dont know havent best advice double check downloaded Beyond dont know havent since joined automaticallyIn case youre hard time Ginchyo could wait get Shingen Kenshin since automatically come Rhyperior Gallade
2012-07-14T17:27:07-0700,Ok got game guess one questionI see things recruiting suchis everything basically repeatable recruit everything example Ive never fan restart anything miss something near start midway game cant get later
2012-07-14T17:36:50-0700,Thus far Ive fought Shinx warlord twice biggest problem Im space store plebs think might reason Im problems recruiting Shinx warlordIt looks like theres spire Electric Kingdom lets summon random Pokemon Warriors based set Wisdom stat Im certain often use certainly usable pick guys might missed early onIm actually quite enjoying theres good FAQ game yet something havent experienced long long time Im hoping finish complete FAQs released would spectacularDoes download take month work Like wait month two decide join something like
2012-07-14T19:46:26-0700,youve beaten main story youre given several episodes choose focus specific warlord youre able rerecruit warriorswarlords got previously theyll old Pokemon link wont carry also go recruit Pokemon previously inaccessible upgrading facilities via bankSo lot stuff repeatable except main story Dont worry get main character backHope helpsIf youve run room select full kingdom kick someone wait kingdoms commandAs warlords probably activate month later passwords work like well
2012-07-14T19:58:08-0700,Yep activated next month Actually theyre going HUGE boon army especially month take Chingling Ralts Fighting kingdom perfect army powerful one Im facing Ive got type advantage 3 Psychics Flying 2 Fires counter 4 pure Fightings pure Grass one GOOD
2012-07-14T22:05:57-0700,guess another questionall downloadable events like repeatable Im clear work
2012-07-14T23:31:44-0700,Motochika Motonari get added team main story downloadable episodes repeatable bonus episodes Youll find last page beat game
2012-07-15T18:18:26-0700,got Pokemon Conquest hours ago Im liking fact Im try take Kingdom Fontaine hope Jigglypuff survives
2012-07-15T18:36:44-0700,Water terrible gets worse Much much worse also strangely better Right biggest problem Im room collect new Warlords thats annoying end Ive got recruit clown mime guy right Ive got space left grab
2012-07-15T20:00:45-0700,run room recruit people Better make note thatis way ditch warriors youve already recruited
2012-07-15T20:50:34-0700,Sadly dont think way ditch warriors recruit reject recruits
2012-07-16T01:20:47-0700,Yes youve recruited warrior select full kingdom ask dismiss warrior
2012-07-16T04:33:20-0700,annoyed beyond anything limit recruiting Thats far away interesting part game least cant stash guys something similar PC box something cant get every Grunt come across ditch one earliest recruits needed Warlord guy weak
2012-07-16T05:33:12-0700,game worth buying Ive read reviews little gameplay replay value
2012-07-16T12:26:44-0700,game played games
2012-07-16T14:20:13-0700,cares replay value theres 30 hours postgame material addition 20 hours regular game materialTheres always good bit RNG manipulation battle nearly randomlygenerated far initial position two battles ever exactly alike
2012-07-16T15:58:45-0700,Youve read pretty inaccurate reviews games replay especially take time work perfect links evolving get multiplayerId like see Riskstyle multiplayer version game though opponents fight control Ransei region
2012-07-17T08:10:43-0700,Heck Id like see tournament support actual VG lol
2012-07-17T17:07:46-0700,moves Pokemon Id agree currently stands game type advantage positioning Id like see variety teams especially given entire metagame would devolve 20ish Warlords 40ish Pokemon much could potentially game casual competitive level would fantastic OP opportunity current iteration quite yetBTW Im using Excel spreadsheets Word better organize stuff get Perfect Links taken care Bidoof sucks
2012-07-17T19:40:38-0700,think would come personal preferences Warlords Even one attack type youre limited six war lords six Pokemon could see trying make best
2012-07-17T19:45:27-0700,one agree Bullados certain warlords simply tower others Kenshins Inspiration anyone many Pokemon easily better others specifically legendaries reason sequel IMO
2012-06-24T15:33:46-0700,think player game different endings different paths depending choices makeFor example 2 villainous teams Well arent villainous team completely different points view neither right wrong player depending users point view side player joinOne team wears tan olive drab team wears grey black trench coats Ill leave figure names 2 teamsThe tan olive drab team thinks pokemon freed trainers much like team plasma grey black trench coat team thinks pokemon slaves every pokemon owned somebody decide side pickI think way teaches kids morals one seems right
2012-06-24T16:31:41-0700,Uhyeahnot people wont choose hypothetical black side views listed kind clash whole right wrong part first statementHaving endings outcomes actions game could fun though Say example back RubySapphire gave choice joining Team Magma Aqua Magma sea paths postE4 water Pokemon could gone map reflective side Aqua land would gone replaced water Pokemon sea lanes open new Pokemon migrating new areas well
2012-06-24T16:37:59-0700,think BlackWhite series favor allowing use HMs second findget Disconnecting gym badge requirement good ideaWhat hope see next generation Pokemon games open world explore beginning Every game linear follow path go area area area certain places actually choose go another direction usually blocked stupid NPC need HM surf strength etc Id like see world NPCs stop HM blocking terrain want go explore half map taking first gym guest Sure get spotted trainer youll likely lose part fun itAlso Id like perhaps see zero new Pokemon next generation access generations Pokemon getgo game use seasons nightday day week separate Pokemon appear seems like games work like access games Pokemon 99 game beat Elite 4 play generations 1 game WhoopieCan access VS Seeker please missing BlackWhite felt Audino hunting much fun get upgrade beat Elite 4 use Gyms Thatd awesome
2012-06-24T16:41:01-0700,like see dialog simple yes continue pick yesAnother thing would like able bad guy guess could 2 teams One good bad get pick side Sometimes gameplay possibilities expand pick Axis Decepticons
2012-06-24T21:23:56-0700,Id like see story thats least complex Dragon Quest honestly thats fairly low bar try hurdle
2012-07-03T13:44:26-0700,think Yellow give selection Pokemon besides average grassfirewater set Like Fighting Dark something little less conventional
2012-07-03T15:41:14-0700,give Masterball start plenty Pokedolls Smoke Balls run away wild battles Let choose first Pokemon
2012-07-03T22:36:26-0700,think 6th generation starter first set games grassfirewaterThen sequel remake released starters already featured first game besychicfightingdarkAfterall rock paper scissors type thing Psychic beating Fighting beating Dark beating Psychic also energy types TCG well
2012-07-04T00:41:34-0700,Ahh may something wink fan fic would Sewaddle Vulpix Feebashear Secondly Ralts Riolu Zorua respectivelySewaddle Leavanny Photo finish first Budew Roserade Grass race headVulpix Ninetales think username explains one biggrinFeebas Milotic Feebas sucky know learn TMs Plus Milotic kinda Water type like tongueRalts GalladeGardevoir Psychic like isnt LegendaryRiolu Lucario Cmon wouldnt starter lol could like Pikachu Yellow Riolus case faithful companion form bond eventually triggers Evolution day courseZorua Zoroark questions please consult username biggrin
2012-07-04T06:17:03-0700,Fox know 6th generation almost assuredly another 100 new Pokemon right new starters like FightingPsychicDark thing quite easily make balanced first area without standard uselessBird combination love much
2012-07-04T13:24:07-0700,FAN FICPlus Garbodor wager good chunk said 100 wont brightest bulbs dept store
2012-07-05T23:41:17-0700,great idea fun kinda safari area pokemon every type multiple different pokemon every type pop make interesting pokemon different ability get area time area give boosted stats kinda deal Also make sure pokemon extra number code one per team use improved starters tourney could expand make great
2012-07-06T06:32:03-0700,1 Starter isnt fire Fighting2 Go back pokemon know like make evo FarfetchedBlack white nothing regions meh3 4 Saint Beasts
2012-07-06T20:10:09-0700,agree FireFighting starters getting bit old now3 consecutive generations meh Plain Grass boring well something like Torterra fun unique GrassGround least Empoleon metal penguin funI doubt well ever get whole WaterFireGrass trio starters really least give fun dual types
2012-07-06T21:57:04-0700,Im sad im coming dont want anymore new Pokemon time came realization couldnt figure Whos Pokemon day rather see Ruby Sapphire remakes first Im open new region yet
2012-07-07T21:22:06-0700,agree Maybe like GrassDragon FireSteel type Something less conventional starter

2012-05-13T17:42:54-0700,Well remember speculation update trio likely based aztec mythology especially look new form shapes depth Tornadus already pure flying doesnt really change giving birdlike body sacred beast form makes sense Cloud serpents always mythological thing well even kinda pushing giving Thundurus large arms legs though personally wouldve based Thundurus thunderbird northern native american mythology even siliglyph based already guess Landorus probably one thats bit stretch jaguars dont normally fly GroundFlying type almost suspect going lose Flying subtype though really knows maybe itll fly running air guess keeps theme
2012-05-13T18:12:08-0700,think might also referential directional gods Japan dont remember theyre called know Byako Landoru Sieryuu Thundurus Suzaku Tornadus Genbu possible trio leader next gen would make sense since theyre already modeled Japanese gods alternate formes Japanese origin
