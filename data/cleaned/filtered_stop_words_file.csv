2024-02-08T03:23:54+0000,Its that time of the year again and I know lots of people are ready to move on from SV So rumors and obviously fake leaks are starting to pop up like mushrooms again leading towards Pokemon DayWith SV having references to Unova and Johto its only natural one would think were revisitng either Gen 2 or Gen 5 Also to isolate actual game discussion from all of this I made this thread Feel free to post the socalled rumors and leaks posted by your fathers brothers cousins neighbor who works at Nintendo and actually not GameFreakMy thoughtsPersonally I just want a proper remake that adds more to what we already had rather than stepping back Im looking at you BDSP In case of Gen 2 I just want an improved HGSS In case of Gen 5 improvements from B2W2 to be present in BW If were getting Legends then just improve on what Arceus hadGraphicwise for remakes I am okay with Lets Go style emphasis on art direction not gameplayEDIT Weve been bamboozled We got Pokemon Z
2024-02-08T03:35:04+0000,Whether its Gen 2 or 5 Im curious if theyll be any new regional forms
2024-02-08T04:36:07+0000,If we get Legends prequels or sequels to those Gens instead of remakes then I could see more regional forms As well as convergent Pokemon
2024-02-08T05:18:05+0000,Well should there be a game announced for 2024 it can go a number of waysGen II Pokmon Legends Celebi Pokmon Lets GO JohtoGen V Pokmon Black White Remakes not very likely Pokmon Legends KyuremGen IXPokmon Scarlet Violet Expansion 2SpinOffPokkn Tournament 2New Pokmon Mystery Dungeon TitleAnd even then I could be entirely wrong about all of these lol
2024-02-08T06:00:08+0000,I wonder if theres going to be an anime based on Pokemon Legends And if theres going to be another special focused on Pokmon mystery dungeon with the natural voices of the Pokemon
2024-02-08T12:09:24+0000,My ideal wants for Pokemon Presents this year and Pokemon for the next couple years would bePokemon Presents 2024Focused on all current mobile games Masters Unite Cafe Remix Sleep and GOSV updates raids mass outbreaks and mythical Pokemon events rumour are pointing to at least one more mythical remainsNew Pokemon Mystery Dungeon game that includes Pokemon gens 79Teaser trailer projects next yearPokemon Presents 2025Quick run through on current mobile games Masters Unite Cafe Remix Sleep and GOLegends game set in Unova new Unovan forms evolutions and convergent Pokemon alike SpringEarly Summer releaseDual Black and Dual White which would be visually updated versions of the Lets Go games but mechanically being updated traditional Pokemon games They would have both the plots of BW and BW2 in them and possibly a new epilogue chapter Winter releasePokemon Presents 2026Quick run through on current mobile games Masters Unite Cafe Remix Sleep and GOGen 10 is announced for winter release
2024-02-08T12:47:02+0000,Despite me wishing GF would take longer between releases I think were going to get a core game reveal We havent had a proper gap year since 2015 so theyre becoming increasingly uncommon and last year had DLC instead of an actual new gameI dont really know what to expect Im guessing something either Johto or Unovarelated but have no idea about shape or form Hoping for something Legendslike I expect whatever games we get this year to also be on the Switch regardless of when the Switch 2 actually comes out or even is revealedAssuming we get a Pokmon Direct which has been the norm for a while I expect like half of it to be dedicated to mobile games that I dont care about personally Wouldnt be surprised if there was also some new anime seeing how many different short series we have gotten in the last few yearsAs for wishes Id love something along New Snap a revived spinoff that gets a proper new installment on the Switch Not really interested in old games getting rereleased if theyre going to be part of the NSO Expansion Pack
2024-02-08T13:29:27+0000,Give me BW remakes they are perfect as is imo so I would like that with some minor upgrades like character customizationAnd maybe something like legends of arceus but for BWPass on everything else
2024-02-08T14:20:47+0000,Personally the only thing I want new gamewise right now is for a Black and White 3 esque game with the first two dropping in virtual console Or a Legendsesque game that serve as such even without that name would work too
2024-02-08T15:13:16+0000,Everything feels like theyre heavily hinting at Gen 2 and Gen 5 in equal measure which is a little strange Usually they hype the upcoming region before announcing a new remake but its usually only one region Even the TCG sets seem to be pointing in both directions with one set featuring Johto Pokemon and the other Unova It would be cool if we got two games in two different regions that tell one story Think LoZ Oracle of AgesSeasonsWhat I really hope for is a Gen 5 remake that puts the story of Black and White and Black and White 2 into one or a Black and White 3 I dont want it to be a Legendsstyle game
2024-02-08T16:11:06+0000,Bringing out Gen 1 and gen 2 games onto NSO and Gen 3 onto the expansion pass But also have them available for purchase separately
2024-02-08T18:28:10+0000,Johto and Unova are my two favourite regions so I would be excited for either but preferably both to be revisited Theyre also the only regions to not have 3D games yetMy hopes would be no remakes any kind tbh and for Kanto to not feature at all in a Johto game Im okay with a Legends style game would prefer a new story set closer in time to the original games so they can revisit the characters
2024-02-08T18:52:39+0000,An Unovan Legends game set in the equivalent of New York in the 1920s would be cool
2024-02-08T19:34:25+0000,In all honesty if we get a Legends game that takes place in Unova then I think they would set it in the time period with the two heroes and the original dragon
2024-02-08T20:00:52+0000,I think new versions of the Johto games are imminent I dont even care if they are regular or Lets Gostyle I know many are thinking we might get Black and White 1 remakes instead Personally I think that if the Pokemon Company does wanna remake them during the current generation theyll probably release in 2025 for the rumored Switch successor As for potential rereleases of the GB GBC and GBA mainline titles from the first three generations given that the Pokemon Company probably doesnt want the experience to be ruined by restore points theyll probably do a compilation title
2024-02-08T21:33:33+0000,I would love to be able to play remakes of BlackWhite in a full scale 3D world like the SwordShield games but better ofc Keep the changes minimal and since people want to see the original dragon they can add up stuff related to himAs for Johto remakes the previous installments relied too much on Kanto pandering and they would benefit from adding a lot more to the story and expanding the region but Im actually not interesting in revisiting Johto right now
2024-02-08T22:01:25+0000,Assuming we are not getting a major announcement for games for the next generation the most likely stuff I think we are getting are Events for ScarletViolet and the mobile spinoffs If we are getting main series game announcements likely remakes for Johto or Unova or a Legends style game At most just teasers for projects next year
2024-02-08T22:16:53+0000,I honestly find it hard to believe we are still getting anything major for the switch so for this year and pokmon Im think something less ambitious like a lets go title but not exactly that I personally would love a pokmon game set in johto but with a twist like your character not being a trainer going for gym badges but something else just a guy solving problems around the region and maybe toppling and evil team on the way Im aware thats a long shot
2024-02-08T22:29:22+0000,Also Im curious what starters they would pick for a Legends Johto or Unova game I could definitely see Froakie for Johto
2024-02-09T03:17:21+0000,I seriously just wish we could get some new leakers like Kaka already but it seems Khu is teasing Black and White or hes potentially trolling Who knows with this guyHe has been trolling more latelyIm pretty sure there was something about a Paradox Unova and that the SV DLC would heavily tease where were heading next and theres no shortage of references to Unova in the DLC I recall another post from him about Game Freak supposedly not being happy with ILCAAnyway just about 19 more days until Pokemon Day
2024-02-09T04:16:38+0000,I dont think that the next game is going to be a remake nor do I want one
2024-02-09T14:00:32+0000,If it does end up being in Johto or Unova doesnt bother me too much Main thing Id like to see is an new part of the lore explored Legends Arceus gave interesting history to a region we already knew I do think a legends game could be interesting as both regions have a lot of unexplored history But even if not a legends game as long as it explores something that makes the regions feel more interesting
2024-02-10T16:42:24+0000,I have an internal bet with myself that the next announcements are going to be new games either new gen or remakes but they wont mention what console right away I have a nagging feeling we are seeing switch 2 or whatever its going to be called later this year Makes me think TPC and GF have probably been working closely to maximise the switch hardware for SV and the next incarnation will be among the first on the next console
2024-02-10T22:29:32+0000,It definitely wont be a new gen since it hasnt even been two years since the Gen 9 started Not to mention TPC will definitely wait until 2026 the 30th anniversary to release Gen 10If Game Freak isnt releasing anything this year then were definitely getting a major spinoff My guess is either Mystery Dungeon or a sequel to Pokkn Tournament
2024-02-10T23:14:08+0000,I dont think they are releasing Gen 10 in 2026 because that would be a massive financial risk for Game Freak as they would essentially be delaying the entire franchise a year
2024-02-10T23:27:56+0000,Oh no it wont Game Freak and TPC arent even close to having a financial risk especially since the vast majority of revenue comes from merchandise not the gamesGame Freak can actually afford to take their time and they want to TPC just keeps them on a tight schedule At any rate there has always been a main series release on an anniversary and thus I see no reason why that would change2006 10th Anniversary2016 20th Anniversary2021 25th Anniversary2026 30th Anniversary Gen 10If there would ever be a financial risk it would benotreleasing a main series title on the 30th anniversary of the franchise
2024-02-10T23:39:03+0000,I was mostly pushing a new gen back a year specifically to celebrate an anniversary and thus decrease the money that could be made in 2025 I think that the 2026 release might just be the DLC for Gen 10
2024-02-11T01:20:06+0000,Theyre not pushing anything back It would obviously be planned that way as it usually isThere was no main series release in 2005 nor in 2015 The year prior to the anniversary is usually bare
2024-02-11T07:19:10+0000,Things can change now especially considering that they usually stick to the three year gaps for new gens even if they already released a main series game that year as seen with SV So Im expecting Gen 10 in 2025 and the DLC in 2026
2024-02-11T09:37:28+0000,Does anyone else find it exciting how we really have no clue as to what is going to happen I cant think of another year that was so mysterious They could go in so many different directions and there is no telling what direction they are choosing I am very curious
2024-02-11T13:12:46+0000,You know its not just the Pokemon franchise thats being very quiet about the future Nintendo in general is keeping their lips shut in the mist of all these rumors about a new Direct and a successor to the Switch
2024-02-11T14:20:47+0000,Mystery Dungeon would be my number 1 pick Specially if a new one adds the gen 6 gen 9 startersI know gen 6 was on Super but that isnt enough I want my ChespinScorbunnycoupleduo
2024-02-11T17:14:19+0000,In all honesty it would make more sense and be more marketable to have Gen 10 release in 2026 for the 30th anniversary rather then having Gen 10 come out in 2025 and have DLC come out in 2026Plus they can always release a different type of main series game in 2025 like Legends Lets Goremake or a new type entirely Heck if we get a new main series game this year they could release DLC for it in 2025
2024-02-11T17:22:07+0000,That hasnt always been the case Generations 3 and 4 each lasted four years
2024-02-11T18:09:07+0000,Except they dont have to release a new gen in a major anniversary year They already broke that pattern in 2021 when they decided to release Sinnoh remakes instead of jumping straight to Gen 9 for the 25th anniversaryFirst off it was not planned for Gen 3 to be four years Diamond and Pearl was delayed a year and was supposed to come out in 2005 and besides things were different back then Back then Japan got the game a full year before the rest of the world did as they took a year off to localize the new gen instead They took 2003 2007 and 2011 off to instead localize RS DP and BW respectively Also theyve stuck hard to the three year gen even to the point where we had two mainline games come out in the same year with both Legends Arceus and SV coming out in 2022
2024-02-11T18:50:07+0000,Look you can agree to disagree But the way I see it Im thinking were gonna get new versions of the Johto games on the Switch this year then well get remakes of Black and White 1 for the rumored successor in 2025 then Gen 10 in 2026 for the 30th anniversary
2024-02-11T18:51:29+0000,Except that argument doesnt work considering the fact that Pokemon Sword and Shield had come out in 2019 so if they had released Scralet Violet for the 25th anniversary in 2021 that would have meant that Gen 8 would have only lasted two yearsAlso sure they dont have to release a new generation on the anniversary however it something they would likely want to do especially when you consider the fact releasing Gen 10 in 2025 would mean its only a year away from the 30th anniversary and few months away from the startAlso the anniversary that fall on interval of 10 are always a bigger deal then the ones that fall on intervals of 5No matter how you try to argue it releasing and tieing Gen 10 to the 30th anniversary is going to be more marketable then really releasing any other game or DLC that year
2024-02-11T19:06:23+0000,Plus theres VGC and I dont know if people would want to be stuck using Scarlet and Violet for VGC for four years straight Oh yeah and all of the other pieces of the franchise like the anime and TCG depend on the usual three year cycle so that they can more quickly get new Pokmon to market and make merch out of
2024-02-11T20:03:57+0000,This argument doesnt work because they can easily release a new game thats not Gen 10 in 2025 or if a main series game comes out this year then they can do DLC in 2025 to hold us over until Gen 10 in 2026Also if they had no problem sticking the vgc in SwordShield for 3 years having Scarlet Violet be the VGC for 4 years isnt going to make much of a difference
2024-02-11T20:14:34+0000,Not only would there be an extra year involved here but also a completely new console And besides neither BDSP or Legends Arceus were fit for competitive play anyways Legends Arceus didnt even have online battling or trading of any kind
2024-02-11T20:18:06+0000,That really doesnt as the first Pokmon main series for a new console doesnt tend to come out until a year more after the new Console has been releasedAlso BDSP and Legends Arceus being thing proves that they have no problem keeping the VGC in the same games for a while so an extra year isnt going to make that much of a difference
2024-02-11T20:22:22+0000,It would just be stale and lead to lower interest compared to if they just put out Gen 10 in 2025 and have 2026 be the first VGC cycle for it The only way it wouldnt be stale is if they released more SV DLC which I highly doubt
2024-02-11T20:30:56+0000,Not really again they had no problems keeping the Gen 8 VGC stuck in SwordShield for 3 years have Scarlet Violet VGC around for 4 years isnt going to make that much of a difference
2024-02-11T21:41:02+0000,Plus if you recall the pandemic affected Gen 8s VGC
2024-02-11T22:15:23+0000,Yeah Gen 8s VGC was heavily affected by COVID There was no World Championships at all in either 2020 or 2021 due to the pandemic so Sword and Shield really only had one year of VGC Scarlet and Violet wont have that excuse
2024-02-11T23:59:22+0000,Id really like to see remakes for Black and White or a Legends game for Unova or Johto
2024-02-12T01:46:08+0000,All I want for Pokemon Day 2024Switch ports of the Gen 17 gamesBlack 3 and White 3 Set 1520 years after Black 2 and White 2A new Legends gameOne more DLC for Scarlet and Violet
2024-02-12T03:21:11+0000,In the next 35yearsBW trilogyGen 10Then after Gen 10 hopefully Pokmon take a break with new gens and just expand on the 10 regions we have by creating prequels or sequels They can still introduce new Pokmon in each game just say we discovered new species whether completely new regional variants branch evo or convergent speciesAdd new areas new stories new characters new Pokmon and even gimmicks to old regions That would be a great way to expand the lore without creating a new Gen
2024-02-13T16:48:12+0000,Wild Unova speculation incomingThePokmon Company International have announced a special collaboration that will run in New York on Pokmon Day February 27th To celebrate both Pokmon Day and the release of Pokmon Horizons on March 7th the landmark will be lit up in blue and yellow between sunset and 2am ESTAlongside this there will be exclusive Timed Research in Pokmon GO for players nearby which gives Pikachu in a Party Hat as well as event themed PokStops and Lure Modules that will have a chance of attracting Unown
2024-02-13T17:11:47+0000,Im still not thinking were revisiting any past region at all
2024-02-13T19:08:23+0000,you know i wouldnt be mad if they just do another bloated mythicallegendary event like Mewtwo and ZeroaraI just realized I can complete Homes pokedex if I had a Diancie
2024-02-13T19:33:03+0000,Youre asking for a lot for one year lolHonestly we are more likely to get BW3 and a Legends game than we are to get Switch ports of past games especially before the 30th anniversary I dont think we should even waste our time hoping for it
2024-02-13T19:43:43+0000,I think if Switch ports happen it will just be gens 13 since they arent dual screen games
2024-02-13T22:16:19+0000,I think so as well Honestly all I really want is Ruby Sapphire which Im sure can be easily implemented with online compatibility
2024-02-14T02:48:27+0000,That seems like the best scenario I mean for the DS games it seems like theyre just releasing new versions of them as evidenced with Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl
2024-02-14T04:24:50+0000,Okay I think the event in New York pretty much tells us where this year is headedI cant imagine TPC choosing New York in particular to host these events and not have anything Unovarelated
2024-02-14T05:02:58+0000,Not to be that guy but how will the Nintendo switch play those dual screen games
2024-02-14T06:18:56+0000,They say the next VGC is going to be held at San Francisco gaspunovagaspNot sure if theres any truth to that
2024-02-14T11:16:23+0000,Honestly id be fine with them skipping a new game this year if it meant they had more time to work on the next title But i know that is kinda unrealistic and unlikely given todays standards for the seriesThat is why i do think that an Unova remake is the most likely scenario Not because i think everything the company posts on social media is a hint somehow but rather because i think that is the best strategy for the momentFor one its too soon for a new generation It shouldnt be long until the next Nintendo console and they already tried a fair amount of experimental titles on the current hardware It is only logical they take advantage of what they learned from these titles and apply it to something that can be seen as the amalgamation of all the successful features they implemented lately rather than another attempt of getting their bearings into something new Hence why i dont see a repeat of Lets Go and Legends happening for now though i can see a few features from PLA carrying over due to the critical acclaim some that may have been too late to add to SV since they were being developed at the same timeA remake is a good opportunity to include more features than usual because they dont have to worry as much about writing and designing
2024-02-14T20:09:31+0000,It wont and we have no need to port themEven better for TPC because it gives them an excuse to push more remakes In fact due to the success of both Lets GO and Legendstechnically BDSP too in terms of initial sales but lets be real it flopped I have a feeling were gonna be seeing A LOT more remakes in the future
2024-02-14T23:08:25+0000,My thought on this is that theyll do new versions of Johto as well as remakes of Black and White 1 and 2 without a doubt within the next few years As for whether or not theyll remake X and Y onwards I think it all depends on one thing if there is a new feature that requires them to be remade FireRed LeafGreen HeartGold and SoulSilver were all made with the intent of implementing the revamped battle system from Ruby and Sapphire into Kanto and Johto And I feel that the remakes weve had since OmegaRuby and AlphaSapphire have been made with the purpose of implementing the Fairytype introduced in X and Y
2024-02-14T23:28:30+0000,Well lets be honest Onlyremake was made with a precise mechanical solution in mindFRLG along withand was made to correct the issue of Ruby Sapphire having neither backwards compatibility nor a daynight cycle These games allowed players to effectively obtain all the pokemon that werent obtainable in Ruby Sapphire Obviously they couldve just added all of these mons to but why do that when you can sell three games lolEvery subsequent remake was made for no other reason than to capitalize on the success of FRLG after realizing Pokmon fans are big on nostalgia Unfortunately they severely dropped the ball on BDSP Hopefully they dont make that same mistake with Gen 5
2024-02-15T15:19:51+0000,a while back Khu made a post talking about the locations focused for the next games in 2024 They were JohtoKanto Unova and Paldeaon top of that hes made posts too asking what everyone thinks well be getting in terms of games Options being remake spin off paradox or legends respectivelyfew days ago somebody made a concept of a hybrid game see photo below Khu recently has liked it and reposted it on his account as well has posting photoshopped versions of Reshiram and Zekrom with HoOh and Lugia design elements onto themdo you think some sort of paradoxical take on these games are on the wind a legends game taking us to and from the Unovas future and Johtos past a whole new amalgam region called Unohto We get both a legends and a remaster but one is in Johto and one is in Unova Unova remaster with Johto DLC like gen 9swhat are your takes are this rumoring and speculation
2024-02-15T15:51:08+0000,Ive heard of this I dont know if I like the idea tbh Id rather have a proper Johto remake than some weird otherworld version where Reshiram and HoOh are one being though Ive got to admit the designs I saw were pretty cool But if it had good graphics and wasnt easy like LGPLGE Id play it anyway
2024-02-15T16:10:49+0000,When those posts came up what most people were speculating were straight up Unova remakes and the Game Boy games coming to NSO
2024-02-15T16:11:24+0000,If they somehow cram in Unova and Johto together then it would be kind of funny that Johto has to again share a game with another region
2024-02-15T16:13:42+0000,I also dont know why they would combine Unova Johto and Kanto together into one game
2024-02-15T16:38:26+0000,Because it would make them tons of money and regardless of what people think a game that has 3 regions in it would be one heck of a major pull for people to get the game
2024-02-15T16:40:16+0000,Its still something they said they would never do again We only got a two region game back in Johto because they made Gold and Silver with the mindset that they would be the last Pokmon games they would ever make and they wanted to go all out on it as a result A three region game would be a massive sink of money and development time that I dont think they would go for
2024-02-15T16:47:12+0000,DLC was also something that was considered something they would never do and yet we got DLC in the last two recent generations Also most people were probably not expecting to get something like Legends Arceus until it was actually revealedSure its debatable whether they would put 3 major regions in a game like that buts its not something that is impossible or that they would never do especially if the game winds up being in 2DAnd before you try to argue that they wouldnt have a 2D Pokemon game again BDSP exist which was basically just 2D lifted upIf they have done something once before then its possible they can do it again
2024-02-15T17:02:05+0000,The only way I would see them ever going them route is if they decided to go the full on MMO route which I highly doubt
2024-02-15T19:39:27+0000,You already have gen 8 and gen 9 with 3 different areasIf a Pradox game is happening all it would be Id wager is something similar to how we can jump from Paldea to Kitakami and to BB Academy
2024-02-15T19:48:11+0000,Although in those cases its more comparable to the Sevii Islands than a full on region
2024-02-15T21:33:14+0000,How big are those DLC maps compared to Paldea anyway It took me about 2 weeks to explore every corner of the Paldea region it was just THAT big Kitakami seemed at least a quarter the size of Paldea Not sure about the Blueberry Academy
2024-02-15T22:25:20+0000,PokemonThey havent called them directs in yearsNot only do they like the alliteration but it separates them from Nintendo and their Nintendo DirectsAnyway I think people expecting a Legends game are a little too ambitious as I feel Legends Arceus was a flash in the pan due to circumstances in attempting to remake Diamond and Pearl in the Gen 8 style only to be redirected into what we got with the assets they had And obviously change things to better suit that game as well as get it out on time for Scarlet and Violets announcement but after BDSP so to not cannibalize that games sales as BDSP was obviously a last minute decision to capitalize on those that wanted true Diamond and Pearl remakesThey said PLA and ScVi started around the same time they never said PLA was intended to be what it was going to end up from the startIn the end of the day any leaks that say theyre announcing games during a Nintendo Direct is false because we should all know by now that Pokemon doesntmain games during Nintendo DirectsAs for what I hope for Eh Ill be minimal and say we might get another remake either Johto again or BlackWhite Probably something BDSP styled because Lets Go was seemingly made due to Gos popularity and the mobile game has waned over the years while I already said a Legends game would be off the table due to how I feel it wasnt plannedAt most they might try to opt for another round of DLC for Scarlet and Violet anything to probably get the remaining transfer only Pokemon onto the SwitchBecause given Dexit a Johto remake wouldnt allow Unovan and Kalosan Pokemon like the Elemental Monkeys and Furfrou and a Unova remake would just have the Unovan PokemonWell duh DLC was something they never do at the time because the games were on the 3DS and they talked constantly about how they werent going to do DLC on the 3DS due to hardware limitations and things like thatWhich was why we all expected a 3rd version or updated games remember Pokemon Gun Honestly their methods of doing updates on the 3DS were terrible considering Pokemon and moves added to one game couldnt be obtained in others like ORAS Megas and USUM Ultra Beasts and Dusk LycanrocAs for Legends Arceus people certainly didnt expect it but they sure as Giratina wanted it because so many were burned by Sword and Shield not being the evolution of the Pokemon franchise like Breath of the Wild and Mario Odyssey wereCant tell you how many This is what they should do for Pokemon Switch news posts and videos that popped up between the Switchs announcement and the communitys reaction to Lets Gosreveal And after with some people not even considering Lets Go being mainline games despite GameFreak saying it was and them using footage of it during their rantsThis was what Pokemon Switch SHOULDVE been
2024-02-16T06:50:23+0000,Honestly Im hoping for a few announcements1 I want a new Johto game It has the post game with Kanto and has some of the best pokemon I would want more inclusion from newer generations stupid BDSP and maybe some regional forms Im also good if this were a Lets Go kind of game2 I want another Legends game Celebi Kyrum or even Zygard Imagine going to the war and getting a special Floette like AZ had3 I want another DLC to drop for SV solely to keep me on those games and prolong it as much as possible before Gen 10 drops I dont want a rushed game I want something done REALLY well So add another DLC where they shoehorn the rest of the Pokemon into the games4 Last but not least I want like the Virtual Console did with the 3DS and have the Switch drop all the old GB GBA and Gamecube Pokmon games It would be pretty awesome to play some of those older games again and move Pokemon up directly from them
2024-02-16T07:24:27+0000,my dream announcements for this presents would have unova remake in any form be it a faithful ILCA remake a legends game a hgssoras style remake where they let us use newer mons too or even black and white 3hoenn pokemon being announced as coming to smile or shiny pokemon in smile because i like the art of smilea new rumble game with shinies there hasnt been a new rumble game since 2019 i miss rumblemaybe something to do with johto too i know its been hinted at
2024-02-16T15:11:09+0000,If they announce a Johto game I want Johto Pokemon to actually be obtainable IN Johto and not Kanto or really late in the game like in Mt Silver
2024-02-16T15:49:32+0000,Thankfully HGSS added the new Safari Zone to allow you to get plenty of Johto mons before the postgame I also want the Gym Leaders to use more Johto Pokmon on their teams Across all eight Gym Leaders a total of four Johto Pokmon were used those being Whitneys Miltank Jasmines Steelix Pryces Pilowswine and Clairs Kingdra The other four Gym Leaders Falkner Bugsy Morty and Chuck use Kanto Pokmon only
2024-02-16T22:59:49+0000,My biggest hope for a Johto game is a modern day sequel that focuses and expands on Johto Its a region that for me has always felt in Kantos shadow It deserves to stand more on its own two legs Like BW2 we should see more regions and areas make the region bigger Introduce modern concepts like regional variants and the thirdfourth legendary Over 20 years has passed since Gen II was launched and seeing that inuniverse could be really cool
2024-02-16T23:19:29+0000,I would love to see Black and White remakes but I would personally have the National Dex updated to include ALL Pokmon released so far and give certain Pokmon new Regional Formes that can be obtained through a brand new Evolution Stone
2024-02-16T23:45:20+0000,Im hoping we get BW remakes this year while Johto remakes could be for the next system since they were already remade once before
2024-02-17T00:14:41+0000,At the very least we should get the BW2 Pokedex any new evolutionsforms since then Thats all I ask for
2024-02-17T04:28:26+0000,Considering GameFreaks stance on keeping the pokedex small Black and White remakes would likely include only the Unova Dex the nonUnova Dex Pokemon obtainable post game and maybe a select group of othersAny regional forms would either be nonexistent because they didnt have them in the original games BDSP didnt allow for regional forms for the Pokemon that had them but were obtainable in BDSP or be only for select Pokemon available after Gen 5 probably for those that cant be obtained in a Switch title yet outside the Unova Dex and none of them startersWere never going to have them pull out all the stops for Black and White remakes And the only way they would possibly handle All 649 Pokemon available up through Black and White at the time excluding the regional forms like they did for BDSP is if they make Black and White remakesBDSP
2024-02-17T14:19:11+0000,That would just mean Furfrou as it and the Watchog line along with the Simi trio are the only Pokemon remaining to not be available in a switch game beyond some mythicals
2024-02-17T16:42:48+0000,I think that eventually every single Pokmon will be available in a game on the Switch This might end up meaning that Unova gets skipped in the remake order and they jump straight to Kalos instead
2024-02-17T17:29:38+0000,Now that you said that Im picturing BW3 or Legends KyuremVictini Kalos remakes
2024-02-17T19:36:20+0000,Just had to fix that for you lol Everything else is fine
2024-02-17T21:26:32+0000,What I want the most is remakes of Black and White that incorporates things from B2W2
2024-02-17T22:46:29+0000,Hey Id be fine with both sets getting remade within the next few years
2024-02-17T22:48:08+0000,Just give me the BW2 Pokedex the PWT Black TowerWhite Treehollow hidden grottos and challenge mode and Ill be happy Im sure we wont get any of those thoughOr I would even be OK with this Just remake both sets of 5th gen games One set this year another set next year BW2 are sequels and have enough new content that they would feel fresh if released as a 2nd set of remakes the following year
2024-02-18T00:41:32+0000,So would I but after things like Dexit and BDSP having only Gen 14 Pokemon I find it hard to believe that a Unova remake game would have Pokemon beyond Gens 15 My ideal game announcement would be a Johto remake or just a new Unova game that is similar to Legends Arceus
2024-02-18T01:10:18+0000,Not to nitpick but the Johto Safari Zone was still a letdown There were only about a dozen or so Johto Pokemon available in it before the postgame almost all of whom could be found in other areas of the region preE4 anyways with a few exceptions such as Misdreavus and MurkrowIf we do get a Lets Goesque game set in Johto then I do think that well get better Johto Pokemon distribution and better Gym Leader rosters Its just funny to me that weve had to wait almost 25 years for GF to fix a problem that couldve been avoided during Gold Silvers initial development
2024-02-18T04:42:02+0000,Notice something battle gimmicks are getting prefixes around the power of ten Mega million evolution Gigabillionntamax Teratrillionstilize So does this mean were gonna get a Petaquadrillionsomething in Gen 10 or 11
2024-02-18T18:05:34+0000,I reckon any BW remake is going to mix it up massively BW3 feels like the way they might go but PLA changed things up so much that I reckon we must be looking down the barrel of something more new and less remake Like returning to that world in a new way probably open world like SV with a new take on all the old locations
2024-02-18T18:12:40+0000,I dont think Pokemon will want to share a short hand name for a gimmick with PETA
2024-02-18T18:58:21+0000,I think that they would still do a traditional remake if they decide to do a more experimental style so that new players wouldnt have to hunt down an old system on a site like eBay or Amazon in order to enjoy the game as it originally was which was one of the reasons why I believe BDSP was even made
2024-02-18T19:59:42+0000,I highly doubt itThere is a why theyve had every Switch game have a limited pool of PokmonWeve never been given a true reason just that theyre doing it and theyre likely going to continue to do itAssuming they even consider it a problem in the first place that isThey probably thought the Pokemon distribution and the Gym Leader rosters made perfect senseIll throw my tinfoil hat theory back in and say I think BDSP were made the way they were because they originally intended for Legends Arceus to be the Diamond and Pearl remakes before it became its own thing originally in the style of Sword and Shield until they had to run it back in scope and make it much more simplistic while BDSP were made just in case people didnt like LegendsCover their ground sort of thingBut I believe a smaller scope remake would probably work more since GameFreak got complaints about Scarlet and Violet so they might not be able to split their employees between the next gen games and a smaller project like Lets GoLegendsMight as well make another BDSP style game if it can be done by another company
2024-02-18T20:48:22+0000,Thats not what I meant I actually meant that every single Pokmon will eventually be available to catch in a game released on the Switch Currently the elemental monkeys the Patrat line and Furfrou are unavailable in a Switch game In fact Furfrou has not been available to catch since USUM and the Patrat line and the elemental monkeys have not been available since XY
2024-02-18T21:24:50+0000,Its possible though not certain Remember the Zmoves as far i can can see their name seems at least according to online sources to be a translation that literally mean fullpowered moves or Zenith rather than a prefix around a power of number 10
2024-02-18T23:06:55+0000,Well if Generation 5 is going to be remade I wonder what additional features the games will have I hope Join Avenue gets some upgrades Although I dont think Well have the luxury of the Dream World
2024-02-18T23:16:03+0000,i legit think a faithful unova remake would work considering unova is pretty standalone as a region and game with it having been a softreboot on its own with very few returning pokemon until the sequel bdsp was bad because it was diamond and pearl and as platinum is the superior version of sinnoh with a way better dex it was not as fun to play but unova COULD work as a faithful remake though the graphics would be ugly if it was done by ILCA unless they did it like an XY style of models as thats what unova characters in a faithful style would look of
2024-02-18T23:18:57+0000,What concerns me about a faithful remake apart from ILCA being involved is that they might cut all of BW2 content
2024-02-18T23:27:23+0000,Rumors about the Switch 2 coming in early 2025 is interesting for the release schedule With that I mean Gen 10Lets say Switch 2 really comes out by that time what happens with the next gen A third gen on the Switch Because releasing a new gen for the next console already in 2025 would be absolutely horrible I dont know when GF got their hands on the dev kits but I cant see how that could work without the games ending up even more a technical abysmall than SV especially after all that backlash that also hit NintendoOn the other side a third gen for the Switch in 2025 means the first full new gen made for the new system would be by the end of 2028 so close to four years after the release of the new console and I dont think GF would take that long for them to move to the next consoleSo at the end I think they could be forced to wait until 2026 and release a new gen for the new console at the 30th anniversary and that would just line up perfectlyThat means I can see them doing two more sets of games One in 2024 one in 2025Honestly I am not a fan of Legends Arceus and the whole we remake gen 5 in chibi style and then Legends Kyurem two months later because we cant have them to apart for longer than a couple of months because marketing issues feels to tiresome and then we get two mediocre games and a lot of wasted ressources In that case let ILCA remake BW1 and BW2 at once in BDSP style and have an expansion for both games that tells the story of a BW3 all packed into one cartridge in one release date Put their ressources into that for 2024 Or a GoldSilver remake which would actually make more sense if we look at the remake release schedule including the Lets go Games and that Johto got no games the longestThen for 2025 its easy SV as an enhanced version for the Switch successor with DLCs included and extra content and the improvements of a third version maybe with an altered story line and a new name for the games Not a lot of ressources needed and I want SV to get a third version treatment before we leave this genThen gen 10 in 2026 Assuming ILCA makes the Unova remake like the Sinnoh ones and Game Freaks side team that also worked on the SWSH DLCs making a potential SV enhanced version that gives the GF the full four years of gen 9 to make and polish the gen 10 gamesIMO thats the best route Pokemon can take in the next 23 years
2024-02-18T23:40:31+0000,Thats assuming Join Avenue doesnt get cut if they only decide to remake locations pertaining to BW1 As for the dreamworld even if they resurrected the pokemon global link site or some sort of substitute I worry that in a couple of years it would be unusable again when they decide to pull the plug on online services
2024-02-19T00:40:09+0000,I liked the concept behind Legends Arceus but I REALLY wish they had thrown in a Distortion World plot and that we had seen at least part of Dialga and Palkias dimensions The TCG teased up with artwork of their home worlds but weve never truly visited either of themAlso the realtime combat really made the game unwinnable for me as I have slower than normal reflexes
2024-02-19T14:19:46+0000,I get the feeling that GF are gonna do something no one is predicting that seems to be their MO since well Gen 5 There is nothing stopping them having a Unova or Johto games without it being a remake similar to say if PLA released but no BDSP beforehandBesides remakes are pointless Gen 4 onwards so I think we may get 2 ARPG game of past region but no base remake
2024-02-19T14:29:13+0000,As I have said they have yet to implement the Fairytype into the Johto adventure plus Black and White 1 and 2 So I think were gonna get those down the line What everyone is having a hard time figuring out is what order they will come
2024-02-19T16:35:39+0000,will be funny if this year will just be Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Sky DX and Lets Go Pichu Togepiwith SV just getting another mythical event alongside mobile game updates
2024-02-19T17:40:11+0000,its always on the 27th so we wont see it until next week
2024-02-19T22:24:03+0000,Could see this as a possible outcome Not too keen on another Lets Go game more so due to the catching mechanic though an Explorers of Sky remake would be pretty sweet
2024-02-19T23:21:28+0000,Well now that Nintendo has finally announced the February Direct for the year seeing how its a partner showcase I believe that in addition to the next mainline series game theyll announce a new spinoff title to fill in the release schedule for April or May As for what specifically I wouldnt mind a remastered version of Mystery Dungeon Explorers as long as it includes the additional content from Explorers of Sky as well as exclusive new features that make it worth revisiting
2024-02-19T23:22:08+0000,Game Freak is working on an actionadventure game with TakeTwo Interactive It was reported last year For a Partner Showcase it seems more likely that Game Freak would reveal something about this game rather than a Pokemon game since we have Pokemon Directs for that sort of thing
2024-02-19T23:32:40+0000,Yeah Theres probably gonna be one on the 27th anyways
2024-02-19T23:39:56+0000,I mean weve had one every year for three consecutive years so far so the odds are pretty good
2024-02-20T02:27:05+0000,Idk what if any features theyd bring in from BW2 but an upgraded Join Avenue seems like the sort of thing they could market like they did with the Grand Underground
2024-02-20T06:14:20+0000,Would a Direct normally have been announced by now in previous years Given were only a week away from Pokemon Day or are they announced nearer to the day itself than this
2024-02-20T06:20:38+0000,Typically the announcement of a Pokmon Presents is made 2 to 4 days prior to the broadcast
2024-02-20T09:58:27+0000,My prediction is a BW3 game It feels like its time to return to Unova Throw in some Chibi remakes of BW or BW2 or maybe a merged version and you have the pattern fro PLA and BDSP repeatedWhich will mean that GF will probably and likely do something completely different thus breaking the patterns again as they always tend to do
2024-02-20T11:13:20+0000,Still thinking the biggest we will get main series wise is a remake or a Legends style game perhaps with a spinoff title sprinkled in If we get a Unova remake we could see younger versions of the BB Elite Four as cameos Lacey and Drayton are pretty obvious but Amarys and Crispin are trickier
2024-02-20T11:19:35+0000,Yeah I just thought they might announce the Pokmon Presents datetime at the partner showcase nothing more But they just announced the pokmon presents today anyway lolLets see what we get Im still assuming nothing major for this year
2024-02-20T12:03:42+0000,All right announcements for both the Direct and this backtoback Intriguing that they announced the Pokemon Presents exactly one week before it happens But hey gives us fans more time to prepare and be excited for it
2024-02-20T12:22:15+0000,Honestly not sure what they plan to reveal if anything significant considering the Switch successor is presumably going to be revealed this year Itd be odd to reveal another Switch title especially considering how many are on the system already Not like Id complain or anything Im hopelessly addicted to Pokemon and would take any game they offered to usIm personally hoping we see another Legends game for early Unova theres enough lore within that gen to justify it I think Arceus sold well enough as a mainlinesidegame to warrant another I also wouldnt mind a Lets Go Johto version the original games were pretty fun outside of the jank throwing mechanic not working sometimes so seeing a beautiful Johto in that artstyle could be really interestingRealistically if theyre announcing a new game its probably going to be a new mobile game or something
2024-02-20T12:44:51+0000,Didnt CentroLeaks say the Switch 2 or whatever it is called was delayed for a year It sounds like Gen X will come out in 2026 AKA on the 30th anniversary of PokemonKhu has been hinting at some unholy fusion of Johto and Unova with paradox legends that are fusions of ReshiramHoOh and ZekromLugia BUT I think he is trolling us all Either that or people misinterpreted the riddle as tends to happen and he was actually saying were getting both regions as separate but intertwined games At the risk of sounding like a killjoy Im seriously hoping it is the latter I dont trust GameFreak to actually pull off such a cool concept properly on the first try
2024-02-20T13:02:32+0000,Unless they go back to the old practice of having Japan get the games a full year before the rest of the world Im not expecting another four year gen
2024-02-20T14:19:39+0000,I dont believe this will happen at all but it would certainly be a first to mix legendary pokemon from different regions and it could even open the door for regular pokemon to be fused Although I doubt a mechanic to let players fuse pokemon will ever exist it would certainly be easier if gamefreak did the mixing themselves but this is wild thinking and I dont think it will come to fruition either way
2024-02-20T19:29:45+0000,Or TPC could simply have Gen 10 launch on the 30th anniversary of the franchise That would make the most senseIve learned long ago not to buy into anything Riddler Khu says given all he does is wait until someone else reveals the truth and takes credit for it The riddles are merely his way of buying timeMore often than not the real leaks come not long before a Pokmon Presents goes live ie Sun Moon getting leaked just hours before the 2016 broadcast so for those who like leaks I would recommend putting your money thereMy honest guess is were going to be receiving two titles one set in Johto and another set in Unova However one of these titles will be developed by a company other than Game Freak please not ILCA
2024-02-20T20:08:09+0000,Well On YouTube Pokemon Presents game category is set as Pokemon GoldSilverSpoiler
2024-02-20T20:42:02+0000,Might want to put that whole thing inside a spoiler tag just for your information But yeah this is what I was expecting
2024-02-20T20:48:16+0000,Hasnt that happened before and it ended up meaning nothing Unless Im experiencing deja vu
2024-02-20T21:10:01+0000,Hopefully Id rather have BW remakes over anything with Johto especially since theyve already had their remakes
2024-02-20T21:12:42+0000,I wouldnt know for sure but if theyre not revisiting that particular region then why put the original games from its debut generation as the category for the YouTube video
2024-02-20T21:23:45+0000,I hope that thats Unova remake because my profile is SnivyBut how will the anime handle that Unova Remake is a good question to ask
2024-02-20T21:37:22+0000,SpoilerMaybe BW remakes and a Johto Legends gameThough if they do nothing with Unova before Gen 10 I wonder why they had a bunch of references to that region in Indigo Disk
2024-02-20T22:17:29+0000,We might get two new games BW remakes and a new Johto game
2024-02-20T22:31:50+0000,This doesnt necessarily denote a particular major release but merely that there is something in the video related to that title
2024-02-20T22:34:47+0000,Namely the music A guy in the comments pointed out that the tune originated in Gold and Silver
2024-02-20T22:37:39+0000,It wont for a lot of reasons mostly relating to VGC I dont think that they would want to have Scarlet and Violet be the VGC game for four years straight especially with the launch of a new console I dont think that Nintendo would want to have the competitive scene for one of their biggest IPs still on their previous console when theyre trying to market a new console
2024-02-20T23:22:35+0000,I imagine they will throw in some Unova pokemon in the anime perhaps the RVT will visit Unova and some character from the BW games may appear as well probably one that didnt appear in Best Wishes like they did with Kabu in GalarExactly I think its Unovas turn
2024-02-20T23:35:43+0000,Utsunomiya didacknowledge that Pokemons release schedule is affecting the quality of the product coupled with the Switchs succesor whatever it may be getting pushed back a year might work in Pokemons favor Its aexcuse to delay Gen 10 another year so it can be on the incoming consoleJohto remakes but instead of going to Kanto at the end we go to Unova
2024-02-20T23:36:46+0000,Given theyve already done this twice before Id say its pretty likely50 of any business success lies in marketing Having a major release on a major anniversary is not only brilliant marketing its imperative marketing which is why theyve already done it twiceAlso and Im kinda tired of mentioning this Nintendo has no power over what TPC does They merely own part of the company they do not run it And for the record the competitive scene is governed entirely by its own companyPlay Pokmon which operated entirely in the United States
2024-02-20T23:44:06+0000,It was actually once with SM DP was delayed and was actually meant to come out in 2005 And besides they dont need to do a new gen for a major anniversary For the 25th they chose to make Sinnoh remakes rather than jumping straight to Gen 9 and all they did for their 15th was localize BW
2024-02-21T00:00:27+0000,The 15th is not a major anniversary and TPC considersa major release and marked it as the major release of the 25th AnniversaryI mean seriously Think of this from the viewpoint of a business owner If you were running The Pokmon Company would you really chooseto launch the next generation on the 30th anniversary of the franchise even worse the year BEFORE the 30th anniversary That is simply not a good business practice and say what you want about the games but The Pokmon Company has EXCELLENT business practicesAlso they plan these generations years in advance ironically enough not just the games but the tv shows movies trading cards and merchandise They would obviously plan ahead for the 30th anniversary
2024-02-21T01:39:46+0000,supposedly the presents is going to feature gold and silver music so it might very well be a johto remake of sorts
2024-02-21T01:42:01+0000,Maybe it relates to Celebi Andor Johto in the nottoodistant future
2024-02-21T02:50:34+0000,Looks a bit like Hisuian Voltorb from what little I see
2024-02-21T03:14:00+0000,DAMN IT WHY ARE THEY HIDING IT IF WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT IT D
2024-02-21T04:03:53+0000,To drive you crazy as their goal is clearly to figure out how to personally drive Rune Knight crazylol XD
2024-02-21T05:23:40+0000,What Who said Im crazy You think Im crazy Im not crazy 11 Theyre crazy Im not crazy1111
2024-02-21T12:06:49+0000,I was gonna suggest what if we got another SV DLC but remembered epilogue more or less confirms thats the end for SVIts been so long since LGPE released I dont think GF will do another game in that style I think it was always intended to be a one off as they bridged the gap between 3DS SwitchIm sticking to my prediction of a set of ARPG games set an older region
2024-02-21T12:13:19+0000,More like a gimmick of a game to help transition casual Pokmon Go players into the mainline games which means that same premise cant necessarily work near as well the second time
2024-02-21T12:28:24+0000,Yeah LGPE was a one off specifically designed to appeal to new players that were brought to the series through Go to help ease them into the main series It also helps that it was released close to Gos hype period
2024-02-21T12:55:57+0000,Theres a lot of talk about two new games one in johto and another in unova but if we are getting these my guess is that the johto one will be lesser scale like LGPE for switch this year keeping the annual releases sigh and the other will be on the switchs sucessorI mean so far all the remakes we got were for new consoles right Never got two remakes in the same console even though they can change that at any moment of courseAlso I think the ILCA slander we see a lot in the community is very misdirected See they are not necessarily bad developers they probably got the outline from the game The Pokmon Company wanted they to make in a very short time and they made THAT the way they could That doesnt mean any future games made by them would be bad
2024-02-21T13:43:25+0000,If SV gets anything itll probably be a new mystery gift or special raid event
2024-02-21T13:44:54+0000,If you count LGPE as a remake than we already got two remakes on the same console with both LGPE and BDSP coming out for the Switch
2024-02-21T15:03:39+0000,LGPE was definitely a remake Not the same remake as that before but a remake nonetheless
2024-02-21T15:11:52+0000,So whats the chance of Pokmon day revealing the Unova remakesAlso they better cook it up with a Unova remake
2024-02-21T15:59:23+0000,Well technically the Epilogue confirms the end to It doesnt necessarily confirm the end of DLC for Scarlet Violet
2024-02-21T16:29:11+0000,I would be very surprised pleasantly surprised mind if Pokemon day gave us more SV news I think weve had the ending and the game wrapped up in a neat purple and pink bowEven today playing the game to try and get the last of the in game trades at the academy I am reminded that its been over two years since SV came out and I have some fatigue over the online Tera raids they never really sorted the issues Im a little tired of ogre ousting its too hard in single playerAnd yet I know this is probably the most fun Ive had with a Pokemon title in decades Paldea was amazing Area Zero possibly the greatest end of game area in Pokmons history Its more iconic than the Unknown Dungeon there I said it and the open world despite graphical issues despite some bugs is one of the most ambitious and at times beautiful game landscapes out thereIf this is the end of SV and I think it is then its had a great run and the next games will surely build on these solid blocks
2024-02-21T23:17:20+0000,we could get another mythical event but otherwise i dont think well see anything close to the DLC we already have gotten
2024-02-22T01:16:51+0000,Im curious assuming we get Unova remakes if all the new locations in B2W2 will be present from the get go in BW I mean Aspertia Floccesy Virbank Lentimas and Humilau just dont get built in a span of two years
2024-02-22T01:48:44+0000,Maybe the routes are there but are blocked off with some type of notice about them being under construction like the Battle Frontier in oras
2024-02-22T01:51:54+0000,Or alternative is they make B2W2 areas DLC for the remakes
2024-02-22T03:41:19+0000,My final predictions for Pokemon Day 2024News about mobile gamesA new Pokemon Legends gameBlack 3White 3Switch ports for Gen 17 gamesA remaster of Pokemon Ranger 12A fully open world Pokemon game Super Pokemon Odyssey or something like that
2024-02-22T06:59:34+0000,Now for mineGamefreak announces that it will be declaring war against Palworld Anybody caught playing Palworld will be labeled an enemy of Gamefreak and have their Switch console banned from NSO Furthermore a team of shinobi will be sent after themOh and Pokmon Sleep 2
2024-02-22T07:12:47+0000,Im hoping for a Pokemon movie another Pokemon Legends game and hopefully the Pokmons first anime season doesnt get the DBZ Kai treatment Maybe a trailer for a secondary anime based on the Legends Arceus but in 2d handdrawn animation
2024-02-22T07:22:40+0000,We are in desperate need for a Pokemon movie Whether it features Ash or the Rising Volt Tacklers itd be nice to see one Could also be something totally unexpected like liveaction or computer animated I think that Pokemon Day would be an appropriate time to announce it
2024-02-22T10:52:16+0000,I hate BW2 story so much I hated the stupid the cat rival subplot Ideally if we get a base Gen 5 remake Id like BW1 story but BW2 dex and featuresWhat if GF get another studio to do the base remake instead of Ilca everyone is just assuming its themThe thing about PLA is it was so unique not sure how they do another Legends without it feeling like weve treading water again so thats why I think well get an ARPG but not necessarily a Legends game or it will be completely different to PLA ie ultimate goal may not be about making a dex etc
2024-02-22T11:06:05+0000,This would be ideal but they have been ignoring the content of the third versions in ORAS BDSP Lets hope they dont do the same with BW2 content
2024-02-22T12:05:15+0000,my honest guess for the presentsMobile game updates Unite Cafe Remix GO Sleep Smile and MastersEXTCG and Championships updateHorizons localization update and possibly a new movie announcementNew animated short series releasePokemon SV raid mass outbreak and possibly new mystery gift event announcements1 or 2 trailers for Pokemon 2024 releases where everyone will be both excited and disappointed as we let the culminative hype and theories bloat our perspectives
2024-02-22T12:32:56+0000,I honestly think the best way to approach Unova would be to do a BW3 thereby using everything in BWBW2 in terms of areas but a new storyline The original dragon storyline has a lot of mileage in it IMO would be an ideal starting point for changing up UnovaWhat would be interesting is if we got new Pokemon that become part of the Unova dex Thats something we havent really seen new Pokemon added to old dexes to up the numbers
2024-02-22T12:50:33+0000,if they did do BW3 I do suspect it will look something like BDSP or Lets Go but play functionally the sameIt could very much be the BW2 dex with some new additions or regional forms added in
2024-02-22T13:39:25+0000,Going into this with low expectations especially after last years was kind of meh Masters is probably the most exciting thing here for me but theres a 99 chance well know what will be shown before the PD Direct cant wait for people to get mad thinking its a mainline trailer before realizing its the evil gacha lolI think Id be ok with most things they could release besides Lets Go Johto A BW remake made with ILCAs boss design would be ideal for me Unpopular opinion but BDSP was more fun to me than the other mainline games on Switch besides Legends Arceus Im also intrigued by the possibility of a B3W3 Whatever it is I hope the game actually runs well
2024-02-22T13:59:19+0000,The thing with that idea though is that it would likely turn off a bunch of potential new players who would be led to believe they need to play both BW BW2 first to understand whats going on in BW3 and you dont necessarily want to do that with a big game release especially when those two prequels are only available for DS systems And whether or not that need is actually accurate the thoughtimplication would definitely still be there and could definitely hurt sales
2024-02-22T14:07:49+0000,I miss the time when we had actual leaked images instead of cryptic leakers messages It was kind of fun trying to guess i they were fake or not like what happened with alolan starters final evos and with that one or two leaked low quality pics of LGPE before we even knew the games existedNow with pokmon day right around the corner Id like something like that to happen again someone claiming to have pics of Unova remakes or lets go johto
2024-02-22T15:27:47+0000,I dont think that follows its entirely possible to unify the two existing plots within one game IMO and a third version could tie it all up further You set it up as the definitive BW experience incorporating the storylines of the first two sets with a third game Doable IMO
2024-02-22T15:45:50+0000,However my point is that the title BW3 would imply a continuation of the previous two stories not a merging of them as you describe in your response which I agree is possible However Id probably call it something much different if youre wanting it to be some sort of super bundle of BW BW2
2024-02-22T16:23:48+0000,If we were to get BW3 games Do you think Iris will remain champion
2024-02-22T17:12:55+0000,We wontIris being Champion is ok Some E4 changes are more than needed especially since Grimsley is now in Alola I can see Brycen becoming an E4
2024-02-22T17:25:35+0000,I dont think that BW3 will happen unless they either remake or rerelease both BW1 and 2 The reason is so that new players dont have to scour eBay for used DSes and DS games which can go for hundreds of dollars in order to understand the story
2024-02-22T17:29:33+0000,B0W0 as a prequel would be interestingAnd name would be a nice pun to Absolute 0 temperature
2024-02-22T18:52:33+0000,You knowthat has the ring of a GF thing to do Black Zero White ZeroThat really works You can go back to the original dragon story introduce the original dragon and have a new plot and areas to bootI like that
2024-02-22T18:59:10+0000,I dont mean to be a killjoy but apparently cEnTrO lEaKs this Pokemon leak account has made a post that talks about current leaks ongoing about pokemon day 2024 Sounds cool rightHeres the thing its actually paywalled Guys we have a bum that shitty accounts paywalling leaks Why do we have to pay up to even see leaks that at best might be potentially questionable
2024-02-22T19:04:01+0000,Lol Im not giving them one cent and nobody else should either We will find soon enough what gamefreak is up to anyway
2024-02-22T19:27:14+0000,Exactly what I was trying to explain to someone earlier so Im glad Im not the only one with this realization
2024-02-22T19:40:27+0000,Dual Black and Dual WhiteILCA styled remakes of BW1 and BW2 merged together pretty much a HGSS scenario on how you progress through it People will complain of the lack of qol updates and other features from the originals missing due to time constraints and limitationsLegends BlackGoldSilverWhiteA legends game where you are traveling back and forth from a past version of Johto and future version of Unova It will have a unifying story that many will wish were two separate games Will act as a pseudo BW3 Focuses on the Shadow Triad as the main antagonists trying to get Ghetsis back into a place of power by uncovering the mystery of the Original Dragon of Unova lore Regional form version exclusives and such will be added and a limited dex from both gen 2 and gen 5s dexes
2024-02-22T19:53:44+0000,exactly where im pulling it frombut in all honesty BW1 ILCA remakes and maybe something else like a Spin off remake seems more likely to me
2024-02-23T02:01:01+0000,Yeah some old pokemon games are inflated and I understand why some people dont want to pay over 100 dollars to greedy resellers for games that costed 40 dollars upon release Apart from that there are features like the dreamworld that simply dont function anymore
2024-02-23T03:15:31+0000,That was the biggest flaw of BW2 The internet support for them were abruptly shut down a year after their release and that really hurt the Medal system and the loss of the Dreamworld cut off how many Pokemon you could get with HA and ruined the gimmick of White Forest and Black City
2024-02-23T12:30:21+0000,To be fair I think its perfectly possible pull off a BW3 at this point just dont make it TOO tied to the other two main stories Just give enough context to the characters ingame and thats itI mean the protagonist for the third game wasnt there for the first two so they can make it in a way it doesnt make much of a difference if the player hasnt been there eitherIm pretty sure this has been done in the game industry a lot specially with older games getting sequels
2024-02-23T13:08:26+0000,Still the presence of the sequel numbering alone can overwhelm new players and possibly force them to spend hundreds of dollars on eBay for old consoles and games just so they can understand the story I think that if a BW3 is happening then both BW1 and 2 will be remade alongside it
2024-02-23T17:30:32+0000,From a business standpoint it would be smarter for TPC to rerelease the original games as well instead of leaving players to outside retailersIf we do get BW3 I do find it likely that BW1 and BW2 will be ported Its just easy money
2024-02-23T17:56:36+0000,I wish they would have released a final 3ds that came preloaded with all the pre Gen 7 games I still have never played the original Gen 3 games since I never owned a Gameboy Advance
2024-02-23T19:49:55+0000,That wouldve been a bad move as it wouldve required a meaty discounting of the market price to make it worth the purchaseI do feel you on the Gen 3 absence though Those games are pretty damn magical I do hope you get the opportunity to play themIn other news I just found out I gotta be up at 6am sharp to watch the live stream now that I live in California This sucks lol
2024-02-23T20:48:12+0000,i am also on the west coast and have set alarms every 5 minutes starting at 545 on the day of a Presents just so i am sure to wake up my boyfriend is so lucky as he gets to wake up at almost 9 in comparison due to us currently being long distance and him currently on the east coast
2024-02-23T22:49:44+0000,Im gonna have to set an alarm as well I might just set it for 530 to make things easier
2024-02-23T23:14:57+0000,Im usually at work at between 730 and 745 my time I dont have a set time to show up so Ill be watching it while at work Just hoping nobody tries to talk to me for those 20ish minutes
2024-02-24T18:54:38+0000,I do believe I work from home that day so Im hella lucky I can just go back to sleep afterwards
2024-02-25T04:24:16+0000,Your reaction ILCA still develops the remakes but the overworld art style follows that of the 3DS games uses full models in battles and its actually an enhanced not faithful remakePersonally I would be okay with that
2024-02-25T04:41:33+0000,I mean if they do a better job of course wed all be fine with it The question is will they
2024-02-25T04:47:59+0000,id enjoy that a lot i think gen 5s artstyle is closer to xys style anyway so itd probably look similar
2024-02-25T05:29:42+0000,Gen 2 and Gen 5 are the only gens that have yet to be made into 3D OFurthermore if you flip the number 2 heheh I said number 2 upside down you get a 5 Coincidence Probably but the more fun answer would be that this was fate
2024-02-25T05:40:59+0000,Getting both Johto AND Unova would be amazing But I seriously doubt it
2024-02-25T05:55:06+0000,unless one is a 2024 release and the other 2025also holy the hell that will break loose if neither gen 2 or gen 5 get a legends or remake announcement and it some new little spin off or another lets go
2024-02-25T06:12:29+0000,For Gen 6 we got Gen 3 For Gen 7 we got Gen 1 For Gen 8 we got Gen 4 So given this formula Im betting either Gen 2 or 5 during Gen 9s run and the other one for Gen 10 I think that they want to eventually have every game in 3D and maybe this could include BW2 since it has its own story
2024-02-25T07:52:46+0000,I think most of the fandom would accept a Lets Go Johto Honestly not sure they would do another Lets Go though given they claimed it was a one off to ease GO fans into the mainline games You never know thoughKeen for whatever is announced agree tbat both Johto and Unova is a stretch Id be happy with either or even though my hearts desire would be both
2024-02-25T08:04:30+0000,For the people who get unreasonably angry about mobile games being in the Presents its been confirmed that were getting new units revealed on Pokemon Day for Masters EX total shocker I know
2024-02-25T10:25:32+0000,Bold statement but I dont think ILCA will be involved this time around Its rare that GF and Ninty ever say publicly that theyre angry with third party developers but it did happen for BDSP which I think is telling
2024-02-25T12:47:01+0000,You know that would be very cool The question is which will come firstThats what Im thinking too From the looks of things they could do Gen 2 first then next year remake Black and White 1 And then during Gen 10 they could remake Black and White 2 followed by a successor to Legends set in Unova And since Legends took place in the past I think it would be cool if the successor took place in the future
2024-02-25T18:48:56+0000,for all we know it could be Bandai Namco or any other developer TPCIGF have worked with before
2024-02-25T21:56:19+0000,I cant remember how far in but Soul Silver went into it in great detail
2024-02-26T00:49:20+0000,Its interesting that Pyoro said that while he has heard of a Unovacentric game the info comes from a while back last year so hes not certain He told Centro hed willingly take an L if its wrong
2024-02-26T02:55:44+0000,If this is still correct we could very well see the same thing that happened with gen 4 happen with gen 5Outsourced 11 remake or traditional qol updated remakeGF Team A made Legends or mold breaking gameWhile GF Team B is working on 2025s release or gen 10But still it is out dated info and we have heard GF talk about shake ups in the past year or so what Tuesday brings is anybodys guess
2024-02-26T03:16:30+0000,So the potential BW remake is outsourced Probably ILCA again Like I said Id be completely fine with it as long as the graphics are at least that of the 3DS eraLets Go and its an enhanced remake You can be faithful on the original game but still add QoL and newupdated features
2024-02-26T03:44:40+0000,Im really dont think ILCA is a poor game developer but it all depends on the conditions the pokmon company has them working on Be it time wise or related to restrictions on alterations in the gamesTheres not much we can do besides praying for the best but Im hopeful itll be better than what we got with BDSP Personally Id like a SWSH style remake of Black and White even if its without the wild area or anything similar to that theres no way theyll make a open world style remake so SWSH style would be my bet for a modernish looking remake
2024-02-26T05:28:56+0000,I do like BW mainly because of the impact of the story and the sheer amount of new pokmon available But none of these are truly new anymore so without improvements to the games content and the overwhelming linearity of the region i dont really think the remake would be able to stand on its own regardless of whatever graphic they chose to go withItd just be another faithful remake that instead of adding to the series just halfheartedly replaces a few features for sometimes worse ones
2024-02-26T11:53:34+0000,Now Switch 2 is all but confirmed for Mar 2025 what if GF outsource completely like they arent making anything this year and them concentrating fully on Gen 10Or what if GF release their Legends style Unova game for the Switch 2 launch
2024-02-26T12:51:50+0000,I can see Switch 2 starting with Johto similar how Switch 1 started with KantoI doubt we wont get any game for this year HybridHero made an interesting video why GF release a new game each year and even started introducing new Pokemon midgen
2024-02-26T13:04:28+0000,Personally if Im going to guess whats coming in presents its going to be Legends Celebi I think that becauseThis year is the 25th anniversary of Gold and Silver so a new Johto game would be appropriate But if Game Freak wants to release it early next year on the Switch Ill be fine with that just as long it is not like the mess that is Scarlet and VioletJohtos lore would make a Legends game set in it work also Celebis timetravel abilities could gives us an excuse to send our character back in timeThe Paradox Pokemon hint in Scarlet Dinosaur Suicune Raikou and Entei past Johto game Same could be said for Unova too Speaking ofI know the writing is on the wall for Black and White getting remakes but if we get them I dont want them to be 1to1 remakes I want them to be HGSS and ORAS levels of quality Add content from the sequels like locations and a postgame inspired by its story upgrade gameplay rather than downgrade from what came before Im looking at you BDSP TMs and contests add regionalforms like Lets Go and maybe the new evolutions from Scarlet and Violet and maybe add more to the story and flesh out the characters a bit more even though the cast good enough already Basically dont be a glorified port Gen V is my favourite generation and what I dont want is for the remake to suck I want it to be goodGoing back to Johto I just have this feeling that were getting something there Im 100 certain of it Also Im sure there are many of you out there that want to see the region make a comeback Hopefully it happens I really want another Legends gameAnd also can we have Gen 1 rereleased for Nintendo Switch Online pweease
2024-02-26T13:10:28+0000,BW from ILCA NoHard pass for me BDSP were already bad and with that dumb nostalgia bait from the recent remakes I dont have any hope for them to make a decent remake
2024-02-26T14:44:54+0000,Ive played HGSS and ORAS many times but I have no desire to go back to BDSP Maybe eventually I will but I never played DiamondPearl so I didnt really feel that nostalgia Ive played Platinum numerous times and BDSP just didnt have the things from Platinum that I liked
2024-02-26T16:26:14+0000,I think a new mythical may get announced the focus of yellow is also the remaining color needed for the spectrum theme this gen has hadTPCI just posted thisWhat lies beyond Ogapon and Terrapagos gaze
2024-02-26T16:30:01+0000,I dont see it Can you post the link to Twitter Maybe they deleted it for some reason
2024-02-26T16:34:42+0000,its on their japanese twitter since right now is the 27th for them
2024-02-26T16:41:42+0000,This was my problem for BDSP It was essentially the exact same game with minor differencesIt was fine with FireRed LeafGreen because those games were meant to solve the lack of backwards compatibility Now they need to step up the ante If they do another carbon copy it just might be the first Pokmon title main or remake that I refuse to buy
2024-02-26T16:48:28+0000,I thought the Sinnoh remakes were gonna be like SwordShield with its own wild areas and everything
2024-02-26T16:55:18+0000,they were on the right track with the new underground environments but ya thats what I was thinking it would be as wellwasnt new enough worth the purchase for meif its the same with gen v ill pass unless it actually looks pretty
2024-02-26T17:19:26+0000,I wish we had been able to see the Distortion World in PLA I wonder if it was originally intended but got scrapped due to covid delays
2024-02-26T17:46:11+0000,But like really it wont take much to do a Black White 3 Just give us a new story a new protagonist and a new town Thats itLiterally everything else can be the same
2024-02-26T17:57:08+0000,Even if its a remake of the original BW and not BW3 Ill probably still get it regardless I never even played the originals and only did Black 2
2024-02-26T18:27:26+0000,i pretty that is just the logo for area zero as Terapagos caused that affect to happen during one of its animations and has been present for both the dlc logos
2024-02-26T20:28:31+0000,Come tomorrow heres hoping for a new Pokemon games with potential including a new legends game
2024-02-26T20:46:01+0000,i think no matter what people will be disappointed in someting
2024-02-26T21:13:26+0000,Im hoping for a Gen II themed games either GoldSilver remakes similar to the Lets Go games or something similar to Legends Arceus I wouldnt be particularly impressed if we get Gen V remakes mainly because I wasnt that fond of BlackWhite to begin with and partially because I fear that remakes of Gen V games would be too faithful to the originals like BDSP were to DP and ultimately disappointing to me
2024-02-26T22:02:43+0000,No argument there Now I dont want to be that guy but I wonder if the future games will have the return of any past game features like the Game Center but with the Voltorb flip Safari Zone the Battle Frontier the berry fields perhaps new fossils
2024-02-26T22:08:40+0000,Its been three years since BDSP and I still hate what they did to these games ILCA developing another remake is expectable but they need to step up and deliver a game that isnt just an appetizer for a Legends game which ends up being as mediocre Just ditch the idea of two remakes at once and make one good remakeSome people may like Arceus I am not one of them and I hope they dont drag the remake bait for longer than neededAt this point I want just a BW12 bundle with BDSP style graphics BUT without inferior to the originals content a bit extra content Maybe developed together with Game Freak B team and NO Legends game as a follow up Sounds budget but with the current technical issues SV had and with the Switch 2 on the horizon I would prefer them saving ressources
2024-02-26T22:23:24+0000,Im personally glad they didnt include any Wild Area areas in Sinnoh The Wild Area in SwSh felt very empty and boring Also glad they didnt force Dynamax into Sinnoh as Im not a fan of the gimmick Definitely wouldve like SwShs art style at least though Thats my main gripe with BDSP
2024-02-26T23:09:44+0000,Unfortunately thats how the world works We cannot reasonably appease everyone Whatever the announcement is regarding the core series is tomorrow will be a disappointment to a section of the fan base This is regardless of it is a new Legendsstyle game a remake a brand new series more SV DLC or anything else Myself Ill just watch and be excited to continue playing the next chapter of a game that has been around since I was 6 years old
2024-02-26T23:12:42+0000,They wouldve had to heavily change the Sinnoh regions layout to fit one in unless they decided to turn the Great Marsh into one So no wonder they decided to put that in the Underground instead but I wished they didnt completely neuter Secret Bases in the process
2024-02-27T00:48:11+0000,I cant be the only one who finds it strange if they go back to Unova andor Johto before going back to the least used Kalos region Why go back to Unova which already had its sequels
2024-02-27T00:58:43+0000,Because they are going in order and Unova comes before Kalos The Unova sequels dont count because they were released during the eratimeframe of gen 5 Like Emerald was for gen 3 and USUM for gen 7 etc
2024-02-27T01:03:35+0000,It only made sense for the first 4 regions since at the time they didnt have any remakes or sequals Unova is a special case where it got its extra games early The problem with all of this is that right now every other region has had years upon years of being in the gamesKalos got one exact year Yippee Its as if GameFreak is trying to forget that region ever happened AshGreninja got retconned XYZ legends all were kept out of SV Every following region got sequels or DLC Plus with gen 10 coming up why not complete the first 9 generations by having every region being estentially completed by Kalos being the last region left to finally get its way overdue sequalsLegends gameIf they want to do Unova regardless then Legends of Kyurem and the real main series games being XY sequals or prequels is the best solution
2024-02-27T01:44:34+0000,I predict that at least one of the following will be announced tomorrow ILCAdeveloped remakes of BW Pokmon Legends Kyurem or Keldeo new DLC for SV that gives us access to northeastern Paldea Gen 1 games for NSO with eventual compatibility with Pokmon HOME a brandnew and completely unexpected spinoff game
2024-02-27T02:04:36+0000,I think that there might not be any more Legends games and that Legends Arceus was just a one off
2024-02-27T02:09:27+0000,To me BW2 are extra in the same way that all of the previous regions got an upgraded version of itself like Emerald Platinum etc Of course BW2 had a completely different story theres no denying that but stillit works similarly by adding a few locations and features like the third installment usually does If they had received a third version at the time instead of BW2 Would you still see it as weird that they might get remakesI think the reason why Kalos got only one set of pokemon games is due to specific circumstances not because they didnt want to give them a third version The fandom has already discussed that for years so Im not going to delve into that but Im sure Kalos will get its turn in the future
2024-02-27T04:38:12+0000,The actual runtime of the Pokemon Presents broadcast will be between thirty and fourty minutes Thats what Im hoping for10 minutes for new game announcementsAnother 10 minutes for announcements of Switch ports1520 minutes for something else
2024-02-27T04:43:24+0000,This is a bit of an overreaction The one in 2022 that revealed Scarlet and Violet was only a minute longer Every other Switch game has had an announcement trailer that was at least 130 In fact BDSP was the only one that short The others were about 3 minutes
2024-02-27T04:59:38+0000,I just wish they dont waste all that precious time with a long introlike they always do
2024-02-27T05:10:34+0000,Konichiwa Welcome to this years Pokmon Day direct So let me start off by telling you all the story of my life It all started when I was born
2024-02-27T05:42:55+0000,Now you know they will lolWe know how this works1 Ishihara is gonna give a long drawnout statement of how much he loves running a billiondollar company then hes gonna let some American dude speak about nothing2 After that hes gonna let a random person make announcements for all the mobile games3 Then another random person is gonna announce a spinoff title4 Finally Ohmoris gonna pop up and give a 90second speech about the new direction of Pokmon and then show the trailer for the newest core series title that everyones gonna complain about but buy anyway
2024-02-27T08:05:42+0000,I think we need a new international rule of the internet it doesnt matter what were discussing or the facts on the ground every Pokemon discussion mustwill include at least one complaint of why no KalosIts maddening
2024-02-27T08:39:38+0000,Well given the reach of Pokmon and how diverse the player base is thats inevitable For example my ideal scenario would be a gap yearalthough I dont think will happen which would upset the huge part of the player base that just want as much Pokemon content as possible
2024-02-27T09:38:42+0000,And if there is nothing to be disappointed about I will be disappointed about not being disappointed
2024-02-27T10:47:30+0000,I think almost everyone would be disappointed if we got another lets go game lol
2024-02-27T11:39:50+0000,My expectations have sunk so low with every passing generation Id be completely okay with that2DHD Black White collection would be amazing though
2024-02-27T11:54:49+0000,Gen 9 remakes in the Lets Go style pls it will be funny
2024-02-27T12:10:43+0000,Id be glad if lets go johto gets announced today not because Im a big fan of lets go will still play them tho but because I really want the Unova remakes to be a Switch 2 titleIn the meantime we could get a BlackWhite 12 port so the remakes would be BW3 That would be the very best scenario for me and next gen gets delayed until 2026 another win in my book
2024-02-27T12:30:46+0000,Same but I bought BDSP anyways anyone wanna care to know why To learn a 2nd language lol Play it in Spanish next to my laptop and type in the Spanish read the English Remake video games are a nice way to learn another language However I havent even finished it And then trying to ace through the game with just 3 Pokemon
2024-02-27T13:11:23+0000,I think that a Celebi centered Legends game could work out very well We do know that Johto is centuries old and has a lot of historic sites Id like to see the Burned Tower before the fire in its full glory and Ecruteak would look stunning in the Legends art style
2024-02-27T13:38:58+0000,Thanks for this Im not going to be able to watch the Presents until later on so this will help avoid the inevitable wave of people covering the news
2024-02-27T13:43:11+0000,Im at work rn so I will not be able to watch it live unfortunately but Ill still follow the news on twitter and hereevents like this are always fun in a way hope we have a good one
2024-02-27T13:52:47+0000,I too want a gap year but I want 2025 to be that yearThe year before an anniversary should always be silent imo
2024-02-27T13:54:59+0000,I just got home from working the night shift and Im so tired but I want to stay awake for like 20 more minutes to watch this thing
2024-02-27T14:10:40+0000,its been pretty straightforward so farwe got 3 minutes leftif anything were getting one more trailerannouncement
2024-02-27T14:15:04+0000,This aged badlyPokemon Legends Z A Kalos region gameKalos fans congrats I am actually stunned
2024-02-27T14:15:30+0000,A new Legends game set in Kalos I think I know someone on this forum whos gonna be very happy
2024-02-27T14:15:50+0000,Well happy that its another Legends game but damn did I not expect Kalos Either way Im fine with it since Kalos always felt like it got the short end of the stick with just the initial games and no follow upsEdit Also happy theyre holding it off until 2025
2024-02-27T14:16:10+0000,Its actually incredible Left field or whatEither way I am actually hyped Kalos was a beautiful region and if it follows the legends formula this will be properly amazing
2024-02-27T14:16:37+0000,They skipped Gen 5 WHAT Haha I just cant get over this
2024-02-27T14:16:40+0000,Hahahahahaha like I said no one knows anything about games before they are announcedGet in Kalos baby about time potential was never fulfilled
2024-02-27T14:17:05+0000,Prediction Theyre going to announce something else later in the year for a fall 2024 release Theres no way they arent gonna have anything to release in the fall Im probably wrong though
2024-02-27T14:19:00+0000,Castelia Sewers here we go Edit o LumioseSounds like well definitely have some new pokemon of some sort if even variants or whatever
2024-02-27T14:19:02+0000,I hope we get abilities this time around because megas without abilities would be awful
2024-02-27T14:19:09+0000,All those Unown and the Legendary Beast I thought it was leading to a Lets Go Johto game
2024-02-27T14:19:35+0000,Happy for all the Kalos fans and it was a region that got the short end of the stickBut Im kinda disappointed that it was neither Johto or Unova my two favourite regions and both being the only ones not in a 3D game
2024-02-27T14:20:31+0000,Maybe well finally get Eternal Floette I mean they went out of their way to give it animation and stats and even 3D models and Dex entries and itd be a total waste not to use them
2024-02-27T14:21:09+0000,also i fall for it too but i am thinking we need to actually ignore khu now
2024-02-27T14:21:36+0000,They always break their own patterns How many times have we been blind sided like this lolI am amazed theres nothing about Nintendo online versions of the old game boy games thoughLegends Z gives us an opportunity to have new Kalos Pokemon surely
2024-02-27T14:21:49+0000,Though Im a little bummed we arent getting a title this year I am glad that were getting a Kalos title since its located right next to PaldeaHopefully Legends ZA connects the two regions
2024-02-27T14:22:42+0000,Wait what about UnovaAnd why do they skip Unova or Johto straight to Kalos
2024-02-27T14:22:52+0000,I mean this is not exactly a bad thing for Unova fans It means the BW remakes will probably come out for the Switch 2 which will definetly have better graphics imagine how pretty castelia will look
2024-02-27T14:23:58+0000,Because of the rampant complaints by fans that Kalos never got a Z or any followup for that matter unlike all the other regions so they finally decided to throw Kalos fans a bone
2024-02-27T14:24:05+0000,Probably saving more development time for BW And potentially the inclusion of B2W2 Gen 5 is a huge game if you think about it
2024-02-27T14:25:50+0000,Im pretty happy with how this turned out BW Remakes for switch 2 is a very good thing we ARE getting back to Unova one way or another eventuallyVery curious about how a legends game will play out in a modern setting Cant wait for another six months of radio silence about the game now sigh
2024-02-27T14:26:11+0000,I nearly had a heart attack when i finally realized it was lumiose in the trailerTotally was not expecting this but totally hyped
2024-02-27T14:26:21+0000,One can only hope lolI do wonder how the game will go because it appears rather modern compared to Legends Arceus I just want AZ to blast a hole into the Crater of Paldea Just give me thatMy sentiments exactly Though I wouldve liked a Gen 5 game at least now we know it holds a chance at being better than before
2024-02-27T14:26:28+0000,So the elemental monkeys PatratWatchog and Furfrou will finally be available on the Switch
2024-02-27T14:26:29+0000,Yeah It would be difficult to remake due to it being the only games in the series to get sequels
2024-02-27T14:26:52+0000,Well That certainly came out of left field Wheres our resident Kalosphile This is her moment
2024-02-27T14:27:08+0000,Theres a good probability that Pokemon Z was already started on in the 3DS and its mostly converting it to Switch I imagine many of the ideas have been around too
2024-02-27T14:28:17+0000,There are so many things left in XY unexplored like the other Power Plants and the Rhyhorn Race They can potentially expand Southern Kalos as well
2024-02-27T14:28:27+0000,Yeah Im predicting the same formula as PLA regional dex will include all Pokmon introduced that generationcant wait for Furfrou to wreck havoc on GTS by the way with a bit of a changeup with the rest of the dex a few regional variantsevolutions
2024-02-27T14:30:03+0000,Well aside from this being a Legends game I dont think anyone saw this coming
2024-02-27T14:30:47+0000,Im actually surprised and looking forward to itI was looking forward to Gen V remake because they were my least favorite games mostly due to how pixelated everything was and the 3D and camera direction always looked awkward and kinda pushed me away from Pokemon for a bit But I really did want to see a proper remake and go through it again If we do get it for Switch 2 with BW2 more I cant complainGen II it was farfetched Wouldve been fun but unless it was a Legends game Im not too stressedNow Gen VI holds a special place in my heart It reignited my passion in the games they werent bad games a little easy but they were fun XY clearly needed that 3rd title that got shafted into oblivion and we got poor Zygarde made into a stupid cell quest in SMUSUMPlus ORAS Never goes wrong thereIm gonna lock in Torchic as a starter hopefully Idk about a regional variant because youd have to put a Mega on top of it
2024-02-27T14:31:12+0000,2025 so does that mean Switch 2 launch title Because they didnt show any footage either
2024-02-27T14:35:39+0000,The official Pokmon Twitter page states that the title will be released onSwitch systemsin 2025That plural is very telling lol
2024-02-27T14:36:27+0000,Personal prediction Switch ports of the Gen 17 games will be coming later this year since theres no new game planned for 2024
2024-02-27T14:37:08+0000,It possibly might end up being a January release to lineup with Legends Arceus release timeAnd the you have Pokemon Day Feb and Switch 2 titles in Holiday SeasonSwitch 2 is slated for Q2 so a bit into the year already and I cant see them having so little time between releases againMight get a performance enhancement patch for Switch 2 if anything
2024-02-27T14:37:13+0000,Renamed the thread I already asked Serebii to make a subforum so please use this thread for discussions
2024-02-27T14:37:59+0000,Cant wait for Incineroar to be a starter and get a Mega and completely destroy competitive Pokemon forever
2024-02-27T14:42:32+0000,I think that this game was meant to be the Breath of the Wild of the Switch 2 and it will release on both the original Switch and the Switch 2 and thats the reason why its not coming in 2024
2024-02-27T14:42:37+0000,Thats crazy we might not get anything this year besides Mighty Raids
2024-02-27T14:43:53+0000,Janejane6178 must be losing their mind right about now
2024-02-27T14:44:15+0000,Hopefully the game will let us follow AZ and also explain Zygardes role in Kalos Its just there with no explanation or even a hint of a connection to Yveltal and Xerneas Plus Im excited to be able to use the Shiny Furfrou that I caught in X during my first play through and accidentally put into Home when I did a transfer from Bank because I forgot I had stored it there for safety reasons And Eternal Floette had better be released as there was way too much work for it to be cast aside for absolutely nothing Kalos always did feel extremely incomplete
2024-02-27T14:47:11+0000,I am actually fine with that if it means more time for development Just wish we had a nice battle facility to spend our time on while waiting for a new title
2024-02-27T14:47:41+0000,Im good with thisLet this game cook some before you release it lmao
2024-02-27T14:49:07+0000,What if we get to participate in the Kalos war There is so much potential with the Legends game besides the Mega Evolution lore
2024-02-27T14:50:17+0000,And kinda confirms new console will be called Switch 2 or something
2024-02-27T14:51:20+0000,TheNoA Twitter account says the game is set ENTIRELY on Lumiose City Curious how that works for obtaining Pokemon Mega Evolution and the Zygarde storyline
2024-02-27T14:51:58+0000,I dont think GF would let us go into a full blown war due to it being a series meant to be played by players of all ages and ratings reasons I mean the Game Corner has been completely removed since Platinum because of concerns it would cause younger players to develop a gambling addiction and the Gambler trainer was changed to be Gamer in FRLG
2024-02-27T14:53:02+0000,I wonder what kind of clothes we will get I can already imagine how many cute outfits notSerena will get There is so much potential for vintage french clothes maybe some inspiration from ChanelThough the trailer didnt exactly made it clear whether the game will be set on the past or future Perhaps its both since the first part showed a rather old sketch while the second part had a futuristic look to it
2024-02-27T14:55:45+0000,Zygarde reveals itself whenever the ecosystem is about to be thrown into irreversible disarray Given how hightech Lumiose is looking here thats pretty much going to be the main message here and Lumiose simply gets too big to sustainWould be funny if they spun that on its head though Set this in the past like PLA and Lumiose simply got too big too fast and Zygarde came up to wreck it Then the humans finally get the message and scale the project back leading to the Lumiose we see in XY Set state Z back to state A
2024-02-27T14:57:03+0000,Interesting I suppose this is the chance to finally have a full scale city in a Pokemon game
2024-02-27T14:57:42+0000,I was not expecting another Legends game at all but I absolutely welcome it This is awesome And to think were gonna see Megas again Since Mega Evolution was introduced weve added 304 Pokemon Its exciting to think about if any older or newer Pokemon will get any
2024-02-27T14:58:38+0000,Gen 6 Pokemon might finally know what mega evolution isDiancie is no longer alone in that department Hopefully some gen 5 get to receive some mega as wellFlorges line may play a bigger role this time so I think they may receive a new form I want some Gen 6 to have a new evo as well esp Klefki Heliolisk Diggersby Hawluchas new form etc
2024-02-27T15:00:15+0000,ok legends ZA is definitely going to be a city planner game if its only in Lumioseits also screaming switch 2 entry title
2024-02-27T15:02:33+0000,From what I can guess with the Urban Development plan this is either taking place in the future or its taking place in the past showing how Lumiose City became the way it was portrayed in X Y
2024-02-27T15:02:58+0000,Eternal Floette exists We know it exists as it was AZs original partner and there was a lot of data left in the Gen VI and VII games for it including a moveset its very own signature move stats and even Dex entries And then Home has 3D models of it
2024-02-27T15:03:39+0000,I mean Yokai watch did it before with yokais being spread out through a huge city but the weird thing is that the main differential about Legends from other main series games is that pokmon can attack the trainer Lumiose would be a pretty chaotic city if that was the case but the town itself shows no sign of rampanging pokmon in the trailer So i am rather confused because without those mechanics it wouldnt really feel like a sucessor to Legends
2024-02-27T15:05:17+0000,Im betting were gonna get new Mega Evolutions Hoping among them that we get Mega Charizard Z Mega Mewtwo Z Mega Feraligatr Mega Serperior and Mega Incineroar And yes I do think were gonna get another set of mixedandmatched starters from Johto Unova and Alola
2024-02-27T15:07:03+0000,Im thinking that Yveltal and Xerneas will get Megas or at least one additional form change to be able to go head to head with Zygarde
2024-02-27T15:07:42+0000,It might be something where instead of just researching Pokemon we catch Pokemon in order to help build up Lumios Will Kalos still be called Kalos Whose ancestors will we meet And will the Player be SerenaCalem from the future or their ancestors
2024-02-27T15:08:58+0000,I doubt thats the only place well be in unless they massively expand the city ala Los Santos in GTA5I gather the game will be set in Lumiose but well still travel to other areas as we did in Legends Arceus
2024-02-27T15:09:42+0000,I think the focus will be redeveloping it but itll take place across Kalos Z is in the title so Zygarde is most certainly gonna have a role
2024-02-27T15:09:44+0000,I think we need to emphasize that this is a REdevelopment of Lumiose City So its definitely set in the modern times I even saw an NPC with rollerskates in the background
2024-02-27T15:10:07+0000,Hope the city will at least have some parksAnd probably more reasons to expand Castelia Sewers
2024-02-27T15:11:07+0000,I was not expecting Kalos but while its a surprise its not an unwelcome one Interesting how the trailer has a completely different visual style of trailer Hard to know what to expect given the teaser gave very little away Some parts looked like it was all part of a virtual world and some parts had a hand drawn stye Not sure what to expect
2024-02-27T15:12:53+0000,perhaps Zygardes power causes some environmental change to the area
2024-02-27T15:13:25+0000,To me it seemed like it was developing the city into what it looks like now Going with the idea that Legends games are set in the past it could be a Pokemon version of the Reconstruction of Paris in the 1800s
2024-02-27T15:13:26+0000,Paris underwent massive renovations in the late 1800s which is around the same time the Meiji period started the time PLA is set in Id say its more likely its in the past especially since they say in the blurb on the website its about rebuilding the city to accomodate both humans and Pokemon We also saw large Pokemon like Onix and Gyarados in the city To me it seems like the reconstruction will be to allow Pokemon of all sizes to live in the city and bond with people
2024-02-27T15:14:10+0000,Or the reconstruction efforts are harming the ecosystem which brings Zygarde out of hiding
2024-02-27T15:14:14+0000,This is nice Ive always had a soft spot for X and Y and its great that were getting a legends game set in Kalos If it follows a similar structure to Legands Arceus Im guessing the Pokedex will consist of all or at least the majority of the Pokemon from the original Kalos Pokdedex along with a handful of new regional variants if were still doing those and a couple of surprises thrown in like perhaps a new Legendary With this in mind Im definitely excited to recreate some of my old X and Y teams
2024-02-27T15:19:55+0000,I hoped Kalos new instalment would take longer to happen so the chances of a Mega Butterfree would be higher This close to GMAX I think the chances are very slimI skipped PLA I really dont care about Kalos and I fully hoped Scarlet would be my last Pokmon game But since they are going to release one more game for the Switch I might end up going for it anyways To early to know lets wait and see
2024-02-27T15:21:24+0000,Yeah Im with with it too More space for dev time and more gap in between games and generationsI think its more that they couldve just spaced out Teal Mask and Indigo Disc more now lol
2024-02-27T15:21:26+0000,2025 release it very much could be on a new console too like what happened with BOTW
2024-02-27T15:24:02+0000,So Gen 10 is 100 going to be in 2026 for the 30th anniversary right
2024-02-27T15:24:15+0000,pardon the double postbut the Unown at the end spelled out Soeywe anybody know if thats a anagram or anythingoh wait its See you never mind
2024-02-27T15:24:45+0000,IDK I think that there is a possibility that 2025 is like 2022 in that we get two separate main series games in one year
2024-02-27T15:25:20+0000,Well In the real world a French inventor patented a threewheeled inline skate model in Paris in 1819 and earlier versions did exist So it could still be an old redevelopment if the Pokemon world is somewhat similar time linewiseAt this stage hard to rule anything out
2024-02-27T15:26:05+0000,No ingame footage as well The next Present is in August typically so a while to wait it seemsLoose disclaimer saying sorry you got your hopes up for Gen IIV remakes
2024-02-27T15:26:56+0000,That would make sense that they get something like the Starters in Legends Arceus gotI wanna see a Regional Form get a mega evolution Like Mega Alola Muk or Mega Hisui Electrode
2024-02-27T15:28:26+0000,Going to be a January release or they wouldve announced it next year in the directBW remakes getting postponed was possible I mean Johto was the region we havent seen the longest And then surprise its Kalos What a weird choice for the current release history Will we ever get normal XY remakes now And what region will be revisited next Now its a totally chaoticAnd yeah no Unova double remake with a Legends Kyurem this gen Maybe a BDSP style remake for late 2025 but coming with that chibi remake when the Switch 2 is already out Nah then it needs to be a classic remake like HGSS but maybe they want to save some ressources Then give us a SV enhancement version that would fit quite good between ZA and Gen 10But hey we are probably getting a 4 years gen again I dont think they would have the nuts to release ZA early 2025 and a brand new gen on a new systen within the first year of the Switch successor And a third gen on the Switch is also highly unlikely otherwise they would introduce the first new gen for the new console almost four years into the lifecycleEarly 2025 Legends ZA late 2025 a SV enhancement late 2026 gen 10As for another Legends gamemaybe they will fix the flaws of Arceus Maybe
2024-02-27T15:30:30+0000,Technological development is neither uniform nor linear The first cannons were used in the 13th century well before France got around to using them The first computer was developed in Ancient Greece I can see the Pokemon equivalent of Paris being further along in development than the equivalent of HokkaidoNot for nothing but the Olympics is being held in Paris this year Seems like an opportune time to get more info around August
2024-02-27T15:30:51+0000,I think that Legends ZA will come out in March of 2025 as a launch title for the Switch 2 with Gen 10 following right behind in November 2025 and then in 2026 we just get the DLC for Gen 10
2024-02-27T15:33:54+0000,I agree its probably going to be an early year release but the fact they are announcing it now doesnt necessarily equate to thatIt could simply be because the fanbase is used to game announcements on February and having nothing new to show now would trigger a storm
2024-02-27T15:36:16+0000,I considered Gen 9 as a whole to be my last generation where I obsess over pokmon most likely leave the franchise so while Kalos isnt my favorite region for me personally this game feels like the perfect send offIt perfectly encapsulates how I feel the most predictable thing about Game Freak is that theyre unpredictable
2024-02-27T15:40:32+0000,Well that was really unexpected I know Im in the minority but the Legends games arent really my thing but Im willing to give it the benefit of the doubt
2024-02-27T15:41:12+0000,So Piplup because it evolves into NapoleonSnivy because Serperior has the fluerdelis the national flower of France on its designThe third would be
2024-02-27T15:42:36+0000,Note also The wording between Pokemon social media and Nintendo of America is inconsistent Pokemon social media says set within but Nintendo of America says entirely Its hard to believe theyd focus ONLY on this location and its even hard to believe theyd be able to make a Legends style game just within the confines of this single city
2024-02-27T15:44:33+0000,I think that this game might straight up remove catching Pokmon entirely and you just get given Pokmon as rewards for completing various sidequests throughout the city
2024-02-27T15:46:22+0000,I mean Yakuza games are set in a single city and they are pretty complete RPGs at least the last 2 numbered ones with monster catching evenIm not saying it WILL be set entirely in lumiose it may be miscommunication but it seems completely possible to me
2024-02-27T15:49:00+0000,They didnt skip anything Unova got a entire Academy with a Elite 4 based in it and a HUGE school biome So it is only fair Kalos gets next
2024-02-27T15:49:38+0000,Yeah Id say theyd have to wait for people to adopt the new system first so if Switch 2 launches Mar 25 then Gen 10 November 26 seems perfectly reasonable to me
2024-02-27T15:52:43+0000,What are the odds this game is so good that it makes you rediscover your passion for the franchise
2024-02-27T15:53:08+0000,Its possible but not exactly in the way you might think Its still possible that after Legends ZA will be when we get either new versions of Johto or remakes of Black and White 1 maybe even both
2024-02-27T15:53:56+0000,For the sake of fairness I would like it to be either ChikoritaTepigPopplio or TotodileSnivyLittenFirst trio fits Kalos better but I dont really care about themSecond trio not a great fit plus Feraligatr so close to Skeledirge but those were my starter picks from their respective regions so I would like it
2024-02-27T15:54:59+0000,Janejane for the next year and a half now that Kalos has been vindicated
2024-02-27T15:55:10+0000,Im hoping it wont have to be a launch title exclusive I already purchased SWITCH with PS5 just for this christmas after a few years of skipping Consoles are SO expensive even for a new game
2024-02-27T15:55:33+0000,Holy crap were going back to Kalos I dont think anyone saw this coming Either way Im excited Cant wait to see what starters we get
2024-02-27T15:57:58+0000,This was the plot twist of a thousand years I am happy to see Kalos again
2024-02-27T15:58:04+0000,The launch date must be January 2025 so next years Presents could be dedicated to the next generation now that 24 is confirmed to be a gap year
2024-02-27T15:58:16+0000,I guess the way Mega Evolutions work in this game would be similar to Lets Go By having the corresponding Mega Stone in your bag rather than have a Pokemon hold themAlso Ive been pondering hypothetical possibilities for this upcoming game1 Alternate Starter Pokemon from the Kalos and Kanto Starters2 New Regional forms or Mega Evolved forms of existing Pokemon3 Possible New Pokemon4 New clothing5 Events and clothing added by having saved data from past titles such as Hoopa and Volcanion6 Poke Ball variationsOf course with the introduction of visible size variations in all Pokemon since Legends Arceus Ive been thinking how this would affect Pumpkaboo and Gougeist
2024-02-27T15:58:54+0000,It isnt the trailer already shows its coming for SwitchIf it will also have a Switch 2 version or not is up to question GF putting that much work I doubt it but for Switch is already confirmed
2024-02-27T15:59:49+0000,Blaziken could be a possibility A rooster was a symbol of France and Blaziken might sort of count for that Though that is 2 bird starters in the same region if they go for Empoleon
2024-02-27T15:59:52+0000,I pressed the ignore button on that one long agoLets see Fenekin Chespin Froakie our starter Lucario just need one more
2024-02-27T16:00:44+0000,This doesnt automatically denote a modern setting In fact nothing in the trailer suggests a new LumioseIt seems more plausible that the current Lumiose Citythe redevelopment and the game will take place prior to the creation of the Lumiose we know
2024-02-27T16:02:11+0000,Really Im just happy we are getting one more game on the base switchBe cool if that was the case Torchic is my favorite fire starter and would definitely be my pick
2024-02-27T16:03:13+0000,I think its pretty likely the first Legends cane out in January because of BDSPSo I cant see them repeating that for no reason
2024-02-27T16:08:15+0000,Oh my god from page 15 to 22 What is going on We are going to Kalos not what I was expecting but exited nonetheless lol
2024-02-27T16:12:35+0000,Depends on how good this game is Im already hyped but Im still waiting for a trailer to show the story gameplay Plus since its coming out next year hopefully it wont have all of the bugsglitches that SV hadThough in all honesty this will probably be my last game where Im actively engaged in Pokmon Ill still probably play the games but itll most likely just be casually Ill still leave the forums stop playing Go not be as involved with the community unless Gen 10 really wins me over Im going to be in my midlate 30s once Gen 10 rolls around so while Ill never completely leave pokmon I still feel like I have to let a part of it goThat being said Im still excited for this game Kalos isnt my favorite region but I did develop a soft spot since I did do a playthrough during the pandemic since I never played the games all the way through before Plus I was upset that we didnt get Pokmon Z when Gen 6 was in its prime so this was LONG overdue
2024-02-27T16:12:39+0000,Either there is a still unannounced game for late 2024 or the more likely scenario there is a game they plan for late 2025 maybe as a Switch 2 warm up like Lets Go or something else that doesnt take much time to do Not profiting of the holiday season TWICE in a row is unimaginable
2024-02-27T16:18:53+0000,Im going to guess Clemont takes a bigger role here if hes still aroundAnd if its set in the future he and Bonnie may be older
2024-02-27T16:19:56+0000,Theyd have to GREATLY expand on the city cause going off of what it was in XY is not enough for an entire game
2024-02-27T16:20:52+0000,Blaziken already has a Mega Evolution so I dont think itll be part of the mixed and matched starters But for that same reason it is possible that well get the Hoenn starters alongside themAlso I just realized that there was a hint to Legends ZA in Scarlet and Violet Paldea is based on Spain Kalos is based on France and both of the reallife countries are neighbors geographically
2024-02-27T16:22:24+0000,I think the bigger hint was that the Kalos legendaries werent included in the Indigo Disk
2024-02-27T16:23:45+0000,Note that the trailer says 2025 without specifying further unlike PLAs reveal trailer which said Early 2022From what we know Pokmon Legends ZA could release on November 2025
2024-02-27T16:24:08+0000,To be fair with how much lore was left unexplored Kalos needed this more than Unova and JohtoMaybe well find out who The one is and the secret behind the message on the board Well almost certainly find out about Zygarde Maybe well get to explore Parfume palace
2024-02-27T16:26:16+0000,I dont think so as I think if that was the case they wouldnt have revealed it now and instead saved it for the 2025 Pokmon Presents
2024-02-27T16:27:21+0000,Announcing a game one year prior to release is the perfect opportunity to build loads of hype especially since we seemingly wont have any mainline game this year not even an outsourced one
2024-02-27T16:28:34+0000,The Kalos trio IS still missing its Ratotoskr in its World Tree inspiration setup We might get the little squirrel hereDrop the first R to make the name Atotoskr and you have the A in ZA even
2024-02-27T16:28:51+0000,Pokemon Z at last Well sort of And we get the year off too
2024-02-27T16:36:58+0000,Hmm Were back in France so could the Swords of Justice and possibly their Paradoxes be involved somehow
2024-02-27T16:37:55+0000,We got the Forces of Nature including a new member in Hisui so I wouldnt be surprised
2024-02-27T16:42:31+0000,Oh I just realized Trevor Tierno and Shaunas ancestors might appear here and be of some use Maybe Shaunas ancestor will be the ultimate evil or maybe her ancestor was a princess I could see Shaunas ancestor being a princess Shauna certainly acts like a sheltered princess sometimes Maybe her ancestor was a warrior princessTrevor will probably have a professor for an ancestor Some things are just meant to beTierno he probably had a warrior ancestorAs funny as it would be if all three had ancestors who were useless I do want them to have story importance They were Pokemons first attempt at giving the player in game friends I have truly fond memories of making them call me mistress Also as an added bonus if their ancestors do something noteworthy then we can make jokes about them
2024-02-27T16:44:57+0000,Im definitely looking forward to AZ and eternal Floette
2024-02-27T16:51:42+0000,ing finally means we dont need to trade Swirlix Spritzee Phantump and Pumpkaboo to evovle
2024-02-27T16:57:10+0000,My sentiments exactly There simply isnt enough to justify setting an entire Pokmon in one townThe only town in the entire series that comes close is Mesagoza and even that city isnt big enough for a whole game Theyd have to do some hardcore expansion for it If they actually manage to pull it off Id be very impressed
2024-02-27T16:57:33+0000,Good Lord the final boss against Zygarde is gonna be insane Considering its forms it could be in three stages with their own health bars
2024-02-27T16:59:06+0000,Lol yeah this reminds me of Zygarde in Dynamax adventures killing my pokemon and NPCs pokemon as well
2024-02-27T17:10:22+0000,I have to imagine that therell be a few settlements besides Lumiose City specifically Camphrier Town which has a castle Parfume Palace And Shalour City home to Mega Evolution Well probably only get a few small settlements Whatll probably happen is that well have to get the city to a certain rank before we can do certain story objectivesI really hope they do something with Parfume Palace Such a pretty place relegated to little more than a detour that added nothing to the plot I wish to buy a fancy dress so that I may visit it
2024-02-27T17:10:50+0000,Imagine they give the 100 form a Mega Its on the table now that Megas are returning
2024-02-27T17:12:32+0000,not just that were looking at the new Spirtomb Wisp collectathon being Zygarde cells
2024-02-27T17:15:33+0000,Cant Bonnies ancestor just sing the Squishy song to calm it down
2024-02-27T17:17:05+0000,Wonder if that means well get a caricature of Napoleon BonaparteHope so Plus maybe Pokemon whose evolutions require trading with a Kings Rock
2024-02-27T17:18:29+0000,lol at all the people saying Kalos wasnt comingjanejane6178won
2024-02-27T17:21:16+0000,I still am weirded out that they had to export the extra Kalos stuff to Alola where its not even related to Kalos at all
2024-02-27T17:25:20+0000,The trailer could be just a fraction of the lumiose plan There could still be kalos areas just like legends arceus did that you repeatedly return to progress the story
2024-02-27T17:28:24+0000,I didnt really put much stock in that since the Creation trio was in the Crown Tundra and then got their own games in the same generation
2024-02-27T17:32:50+0000,It very much could be They could even make it 4 stages if they start the battle with a Zygarde core or if they add some new form
2024-02-27T17:37:06+0000,Three Im thinking fivePhase 1 10 ZygardePhase 2 25 ZygardePhase 3 50 ZygardePhase 4 75 ZygardeFinal Phase 100 Zygarde
2024-02-27T17:37:47+0000,For the available Pokemon I wonder if they would copy what Legends Arceus did which is Sinnohs regional Dex specifically mostly the extended Platinum Dex and a few extras Assuming we are using the Kalos regional Dex as a basis not sure if the game will include the ORAS Megas as it includes Rayquaza and another set of startersIf anything we can see Mega Metagross if it is included with the new metallic textures just happened to have a second shiny Beldum in SV
2024-02-27T17:42:43+0000,Do you guys think that Kalos will still be called Kalos I think it will be but its always possible that it had a different nameHow funny would it be if this game was mercilessly hard compared to how easy X and Y were
2024-02-27T17:44:12+0000,one thing i noticed is that the digital blueprints go back to a paper sketch at the endperhaps this is earlier Kalso planning on the redevelopment of Lumiose to modernize it into what we knowand what we see was just the vision of it
2024-02-27T17:45:25+0000,France has been France for a very long time unlike Hokkaido
2024-02-27T17:47:25+0000,Good for her tbh Kalos was probably going to get some sort of remake eventually and it came earlier than expected
2024-02-27T17:48:18+0000,I know that as an adult Im not necessarily the target audience here but that scene just comes off as silly to me like here we have a raging deity in the process of destroying the Pokemon worlds version of France but some kid the deity befriended once turns on the waterworks and starts singing and the deity is like Oh sorry Ill be chill nowIm not saying it would never happen if a realworld deity like Zeus got pissed off at something decided to attack Paris and some human child he befriended tried to talk him out of it but if hes in such a blind rage then hes not in the right frame of mind to be reasoned with in that manner realistically speaking
2024-02-27T17:56:17+0000,Yeah it was a little goofy I mean I get that the song was a reminder of the good times Squishy had with Bonnie and that helped it break through the brainwashing but if you really think about it it really does take you out of the momentWhich of course is why I expect the game to do something similar to it
2024-02-27T18:12:44+0000,While do have a hint that megas will be in this game there is a possibility that could also occur is new regional formsevolutionsother new forms While megas are likely the major focus I wouldnt rule it out completely that we get some more permanent additions as well
2024-02-27T18:17:10+0000,we dont know truly the extentjust that Lumiose City will be a very heavy focus on the game
2024-02-27T18:27:52+0000,The entirely on lumiose city could just mean that we wont be able to visit other cities but will still be able to travel to another locations to gather resources for the reconstruction maybebut the way the teaser was presented Id say I believe in the whole game being inside Lumiose only
2024-02-27T18:29:25+0000,All I care about is getting an answer to one of these two questions1 Who is the one2 What was up with that signboard
2024-02-27T18:42:41+0000,So Ive seen some speculation for Piplup and Snivy for two of our starters Could someone fill me in on their connections to France
2024-02-27T18:49:01+0000,Piplup line is not only inspired by Ocean myths Poseidon and such but also NapoleonSnivy line is based off of the FleurDeLis and French Aristocracy
2024-02-27T18:50:39+0000,Empoleon has Napoleon as part of its inspiration and hes a very famous French general One of Serperiors inspirations is from a manga set during the French Revolution
2024-02-27T18:53:38+0000,Empoleon Emperor NapoleonSerperior the Regal PokemonNot sure about a potential fire type I think we can rule out a few though like Charizard has 2 megas and Im certain the starters for this game and probably the Kalos starters will get megas Typhlosion was in PLA Blaziken has a mega Delphox Kalos starter Skeledirge too new So this leaves Infernape Emboar Incineroar and Cinderace EDIT Can also rule out Infernape and Emboar since they are the same generations as Empoleon and Emboar
2024-02-27T19:03:23+0000,I only have one wishPlease God please no Mega Charizard Z PLEASE
2024-02-27T19:03:29+0000,Im thinking Cinderace or Incineroar as they would avoid using Infernape if they use Empoleon and same goes for Emboar to avoid two starters from the same region Cinderace turning into a musketeer with a fiery foil would be cool It would be very fitting for Cinderace too as it is supposed to be based on an athlete and fencing is very popular in France and is historically linked to the nation I can picture the red tuft of hair on its head becoming more feathery and fluffy and its ears form the base of the hat Or they could do something unexpected and make it based off of Cinderella and the Prince for gender differences
2024-02-27T19:05:50+0000,Oh yeah I didnt even think about them avoiding multiple starters from the same generation Ill update my post with that
2024-02-27T19:08:04+0000,SpoilerFor real though Super surprised they skipped Unova but Honestly pretty excited Interested to see what direction it takes and glad to see the Legends brand will continue Just wonder what kinda of time frame were looking at for the setting
2024-02-27T19:11:52+0000,Im happy to have a new Pokmon game in general and am glad to see Kalos getting some love given how incomplete Gen VI was I still dont understand where Zygarde fits into Kalos mythology or the Mortality Duo Its just there with abs no explanation I would have even accepted a single NPC mentioning Zygarde protecting the ecosystem in XY
2024-02-27T19:15:45+0000,I feel like this is inevitable Its coming no matter what whether we want it or not
2024-02-27T19:19:17+0000,Unova already has two sets of games so Kalos deserves it more
2024-02-27T19:39:34+0000,I really want them to do Mega Charizard Z simply because I want to see the fandom reaction to it Would be fantastic
2024-02-27T19:40:29+0000,Mega Charizard ZDragonFlying typeAbilityFiery SpiritGives 50 boost to Fire type moves
2024-02-27T19:45:52+0000,The evolutions went from orange to red back to orange Well none of the Mega Charizards were red Heres hoping a Mega Charizard Z would be red
2024-02-27T19:51:56+0000,O yea Hisui Pokedex was only 242 If this game is very similar expect a small pokedex
2024-02-27T19:57:18+0000,Make it happen Game Freak I want to see the outrage
2024-02-27T19:58:15+0000,Think Ive over the initial hype As someone whos favorite Legendary and third favorite Pokmon is Zygarde I am very pleased with this And theyre actually taking a break year for the first in just shy of a decade Gives me a chance to catch up on my backlog It being a Legends game is the perfect way to end this for me Kalos being underdeveloped is a low hanging fruit in the community at this point so Im glad to see that itll get a redemption Theres a few other ideas I have about this game but Ill save that for later once Im off workI am so glad its not Lets Go lol I wouldve taken a BDSP styled game over thatPlease Mega Incineroar sounded like a fever dream but it could be a possibility
2024-02-27T20:04:08+0000,XY had the largest regional dex by far 457 compared to USUM SwSh and SV which were all around the 400 mark I agree that we definitely should not expect anything on that size for PLZAThat said I do hope there are more Pokmon than in PLA The small dex was my biggest gripe with that game and depending on how much PLZA builds on PLA a lot of the groundwork may already be in place
2024-02-27T20:04:40+0000,Wait until its revealed that Nov 2024 will have a new Pokemon game like BW 3 that was made by ILCA
2024-02-27T20:08:21+0000,I wonder if we will be able to visit Laverre or Snowbelle City they would look beautiful with the switch graphics
2024-02-27T20:09:05+0000,I wouldnt be super surprised but at this point Im not really expecting it IIRC USUM had a June reveal to November release turnaround in 2017
2024-02-27T20:10:18+0000,the twitter accounts is saying that the game will ENTIRELY be in Lumiose Citywhether or not that is true I dont think well be seeing any other cities outside of this one
2024-02-27T20:11:20+0000,Also from the looks of TPCI Japans Twitter the title is closer to being pronounced as Pokemon Legends Zeta in english
2024-02-27T20:11:33+0000,Perhaps the locations where those cities are supposed to be Snowy and Autumn places
2024-02-27T20:15:40+0000,If they have areas like the ones in Indigo Disk then I dont mind being confined to Lumiose City We will probably get a better look at how that will function in the next trailerwhich wont be anytime soon unfortunately
2024-02-27T20:18:01+0000,Hohhhh Is this going to be like GTA where its just the city
2024-02-27T20:18:29+0000,good grief if they make bosses and any noble bosses anywhere near that tough or even just 3 phases then the games better not have that glitch where you are unable to summon a pokemon into the battleI never managed to finish PLA
2024-02-27T20:20:43+0000,Yeah I kinda find hard to believe that we wont at least get some nature locations
2024-02-27T20:23:42+0000,One possibility is that this is set sometime after the war and what were seeing is the survivors attempting to rebuild hence there being no other townscities I cant really think of too many reasons why we shouldnt have at least one small settlement outside of Lumios After all Kalos isnt exactly a new region
2024-02-27T20:24:40+0000,So what are we thinking about possible mega evolutions in the gameMy guessesMost if not all Pokemon that are available in game that can already mega evolve from XYORASThe starters for this gameThe Kalos starters assuming they arent the actual startersThe legendary trio will get some form of mega evolution see Primal GroudonKyogreMega RayquazaFlygon lol just kiddingMaybe Volcanion since it doesnt have a mega or alternate formMega Charizard Z and Mega Charizard A not really but I wouldnt put it past themAny others
2024-02-27T20:25:59+0000,Or they could give Chesnaught and Delphox Bond Phenomenon forms
2024-02-27T20:28:40+0000,75 being based off of Sleipnir to finish the theme of Lokis children would be awesome
2024-02-27T20:36:53+0000,I kind of wonder how leaks will be handled going forward after this announcementPeople were apprenshive about them for a while and if theyre like me theyre probably also fed up with the drama between ex the CentroKhu scenario but since they all claimed we were getting Johto or Unova games sometimes even both I cant see anyone really giving leaks any attention or paying any attention aside from the die hard fans
2024-02-27T20:41:43+0000,Khu will still have some diehard supporters who will bend over backwards to believe him but it seems like his credibility is gone now He almost certainly had a legit source at some point but that has likely dried up by now
2024-02-27T20:45:57+0000,he pulled out his leak about the codename for Pokemon Legends ZA and now everyone is thinking his leaks are in relation to this game
2024-02-27T20:50:59+0000,Hey you know what would be interestingIf they some how normalized Inverse Battles as a battle mechanic like the Style MovesType Flipping moves Type Changing Mega formsNew Alt EvolutionsAlso reminder that the Z Axis moves both up and down we could be exploring areas above as well as below this Lumiose City
2024-02-27T20:57:03+0000,The official LEGENDS ZA subforum has been openedPlease use it insteadPokmon Legends ZA DiscussionDiscuss the coming game Pokmon Legends ZA hereforumsserebiinetAlso this thread has been renamed into a General Discussion Thread
2024-02-27T21:12:30+0000,Because people would rather believe he was right than admit theyve been fooled Its what hes been doing for yearsHe is almost never correct he merely bides his time until someone else has accurate information or an announcement is actually made Then he pulls a Houdini to tie in his riddles with the announcement People fall for it every time and its quite sad
2024-02-27T21:14:47+0000,Charmeleon is always red as if the skin is abut to shed
2024-02-28T00:33:46+0000,The whole thread can be moved but itll be redundantPages can be merged with the ZA DiscussionSpeculation thread but itll mess up the postsSo Id rather not
2024-02-28T02:01:57+0000,SpoilerThe ScarletViolet rotom phones remains untouched
2024-02-28T02:39:04+0000,this continues to bother me as they are the best phone cases imo
2024-02-28T21:26:45+0000,I wouldnt be surprised if we got Charizard Z1 and Charizard Z2 lmao
2024-02-28T22:50:10+0000,The fact Charizard didnt have a new form in Gen IX was almost as shocking as the plot twist around the professors
2024-03-04T02:43:50+0000,I lt was the first to get dedicated Tera Raids Thats Charizards form for Scarlet Violet
2024-03-05T00:43:43+0000,It is also the first mighty raid to have its event repeated
2024-03-06T14:36:12+0000,Can we take a moment to discuss how Scarlet Violet does a terrible job showcasing the new pokemonI keep forgetting most of them even exist Ifound out Kilowattrel is the regional bird
2024-03-06T14:57:08+0000,I would say both are the regional birds Some regions have more than one but only one line is seen a bit more Take Hoenn for example Taillow is commonly said to be the regional bird due to how common it is in Hoenn but Wingull is also extremely common and used by just as many Trainers as Taillow
2024-03-06T15:02:41+0000,I think the issue is should the regional bird be NormalFlying if it isnt 2 or 3 stage or should it be some other FlyingWingull is equivalent to Wattrell for exampleThat could be why GF made the Fletching line NormalFlying even though it eventually becomes FireFlying or with Corviknights preevos being Flying before FlyingSteel
2024-03-06T17:46:24+0000,the problem is the open world systemits why the dex ordering is such a mess as wellbecause it takes into account several different places at one to categorize orderthe other issue is that Wattrel was placed along the coasts so its not actually available on route 1 really without the ability to swimthis would be solved with a more linear route system mapped outSqwakabilly is more like Spearow of the region or a stand out like Chatot is for gen 4 its not found until the 2nd gym
2024-03-06T18:46:23+0000,It wouldve been solved by simply having Wattrel show up on the Poco Path lolAlso I do agree that the dex ordering is trash It shouldve been ordered according to province South East West then North
2024-03-06T18:50:40+0000,speaking of whichI remember the dex order bugging me so I remade the original gen 9 dex in a order I felt was more suitable its not perfect but to me it works moreEDIT I think what Id fix is just putting the Grafaiai line between the Houndstone and Lokix line
2023-07-19T23:23:56+0100,I was surprised by many things involving area zero such as ZadaTuro not being alive and the AI working on their behalf
2023-07-19T23:25:10+0100,Until SV came out I didnt know how much laggy and buggy a game can be after production
2023-07-19T23:39:58+0100,Yeah the twists with the professors were a genuine shock Im happy I managed to avoid plot spoilers for those reveals
2023-07-20T21:41:27+0100,the ending for sure even with rumourings of AI characters in the game I thought if it was going to happen it was going to be Geetaspeaking of which I am surprised at the team Geeta uses
2023-07-21T22:05:06+0100,I was surprised that I actually enjoyed the battle system being closer to the previous mainline titles After PLA I really was dreading going back to battling to capture without just chucking Pokeballs Yet weirdly I really enjoyed it this time around the interactive aspect of the games battling encounters felt polishedI have also been pleasantly surprised by how lovely Paldea is to just travel around Do I wish the graphics were better Yes but it still has a certain je ne sais quoiI am surprised that I am very much looking forward to the DLC packs
2023-07-21T22:11:14+0100,Arvens backstory most Ive cried at a pokemon game plot in a minute
2023-07-23T15:15:05+0100,I was surprised to have actually like it as much as I did I was expecting something Id do because Im too far gone into the franchise just like SwSh but I really end up enjoying it and still keep playing it
2023-07-23T16:12:12+0100,I was surprised at how much I liked Nemonas storyline I saw all of the jokes about how they interpreted her as a creepy stalker and thought she was going to be annoying at best but as the story progressed I really started connecting with her because she came off as someone who hyper fixated on battling but constantly has to hold back because shes too much of a people pleaser This was the first time I really saw a character in Pokmon who really felt like me and she ended up becoming my favorite rival because of itI was also surprised at how I ended up bonding with all of the teachers I did the classes at first just because I was a completionist but by the end they all felt like fleshed out characters that made the school portions of the game feel like an anime
2023-07-23T21:38:27+0100,That the Pawmi line could actually swim and look adorable treading water I thought it was one of the cutest things Ive ever seen in a Pokmon game I was also surprised how useful Naclstack and Gargnacl that have Sturdy and Salt Cure can massively help you during the story especially during Gym battles as Sturdy lets you be able to survive one massive hit to setup the Salt Cure effect which in turn can cause the target to lose a good amount of health in between turns This is especially useful against Teratilized Pokmon
2023-07-23T22:36:54+0100,If were talking major aspects then its definitely the art style for me I kind of like it but I was surprised by how realistic they decided to make the human characters look ingame when we got the first proper trailer I feel like most aspects of SV feel like natural steps to build on SwSh and PLA thoughIf were talking about minor stuff then I think the most surprising thing for me was the removal of Set battle mode It doesnt matter much since you can emulate it by simply not switching after a knockout but it was one of those things I didnt expect ever to get removed
2023-07-27T07:04:41+0100,The ending being the most depressing piece of media Ive witnessed in a whileAlso wasnt expecting a character whos on screen for like five minutes actually as themselves without pretending to be someone else or being essentially possessed to be my favorite character in the game by FAR
2023-07-27T07:18:48+0100,The games touching up upon death was not something I ever expected from a Pokemon game because its something theyve mostly shied away from since generation 1 and Marowak Hearing them say the professors passed away was genuinely surprisingAlso most of Arvens storyline
2023-08-04T21:48:03+0100,It wasnt ineither and I think no one batted an eye I would like fishing to return though
2023-08-05T01:20:38+0100,The plot twist of courseI never thought Pokmon would go that route
2023-08-05T06:31:15+0100,Yeah it feels like the only other time Pokemon has usedcharacter deathas a plot device was in XY withFloette only Floette got better
2023-10-06T02:31:01+0100,Almost a year later the game still runs awful and slow the glitches I love the game and story and if they fixed that it would be up there for me with BW its just so much fun
2023-11-03T23:33:58+0000,One of the things that surprised me about Pokmon Violet is the way Miraidon completely replaced the bike
2023-11-04T15:06:26+0000,Yeah after nearly 30 years Game Freak shouldnt be having these kinds of issues But alas they keep biting off more than they can chewI really wish they would just pass on series development to Bandai Namco
2023-11-04T15:19:01+0000,Number of 6v6 battlesGeetaNemonaArvenClavellPennyAll the Teachers Hassel in the Academy Star TournamentSadaTuroKieranOnly sad Carmine and Muramasa were not 6v6 from those which disappointed meIn SV we only had Hop Leon Mustard and Honey Even Champion Peony was a 5v5 sae for Leon rematches
2023-11-12T02:36:39+0000,I was surprised to see how many pokemon that had fur or scales that we couldnt quite tell had them until now thanks to the more detailed models like Gliscor having short fur on the back of its wing membranes
2023-11-16T00:49:05+0000,I didnt realize until recently that the number of Pokemon who can learn Scald has been greatly reduced
2023-11-16T09:38:50+0000,Another thing that honestly surprises me is reaching the peak of Glaseado Mountain and from there having the sight of the entire Paldea region
2023-11-16T15:39:52+0000,That would NEVER happen Pokemon has been one of Nintendos biggest moneymaker franchises for decades Theyre not letting the franchise goBig twist in how the Gym Leaders levels are hidden Obviously Brassius and Katys are similar levels But if you thought Kofu is next instead of Iono you are dead wrong His level 29 water pokemonhit a lot hardercompared to Ionos level 23 paralyzing tactics
2023-11-22T16:55:24+0000,selling items in bulk and the fact that you can grab up to 10 eggs at once in picnics and a bunch of other QOL featuresalso I was quite surprised when I jumped off a watchtower and there wasnt some kinda black transmission screen I was so used to slow transmissions from gen 67 but now the game loads zones in real time and its still wild to me
2023-11-24T20:20:25+0000,The games have already been out for quite a while so i think its safe to say it but the fact that the Professor SadaTuro were dead the whole time and a robot with a malfunctioning program was in chargeQuite a shockerThis franchise only has a few other deaths Floette isnt the only oneLatios That blue psychic dragon gave his life to protect Alto MareSir Aaron also known as Lucarios ownermasterCyrus is most likely deadLysandre in the games the weapon of mass destruction got buried i doubt anyone survivedThe oldsick Stoutland that Ashs Litten followedBut TuroSada really felt like something else since it is a real death that was confirmed and were likely were killed by the rogue versions of KoraidonMiraidon
2023-11-27T08:45:52+0000,In what timeline is Cyrus most likely dead Even in the anime when they revisited the plot they heavily implied he was still aliveLikely were killed by those pokemon The AI explicitly tells you what happened
2023-11-27T19:21:59+0000,Maybe Platinum I mean the Reverse World didnt really show any signs of plants and vegetables that were fit for human consumption and we dont even know if the water found there was suitable for drinking Giratina had adapted for living in this world but nothing else was ever found on our way to the Legendary Dragon The other two games implied that Cyrus found a portal to a new and different world which is most likely some parallel universe with slight changes to our own world The anime is pretty much the same thing Cyrus technically succeeded in his plan and got to have a brand new world of his own even if the one he was currently in wasnt destroyed like he had originally planned
2023-11-28T01:20:30+0000,We also dont know that hes stuck there either The player character and Cynthia just walk out And the other two games imply that he just left and is still searching for a way to achieve his goal or in BDSP where he works for Palmer at the Battle Tower
2023-11-29T12:33:40+0000,Is that being fair though Theyre not a triple A studio and the majority of those years they have been developing games for subpar Nintendo handhelds The Switch has probably been nothing but one giant learning experience for GF heck you have had triple A studios put out games in far worse conditions than SV TOTK is more expensive suffers from performance issues and the map is mostly empty compared to SV where you literally have Pokemon scattered all over the place yet people have no issues blaming the hardware for that but when it comes to Pokemon its GF being lazyPeople constantly say they arent an indie studio but they are still a relatively small studio a quick google search shows they have 169 employees vs like 400 of InsomniacYes the game shouldnt have been put out in the state that it was but they didnt publish the game so ultimately dont know how much say they had in delaying it
2023-11-29T22:28:56+0000,Im well aware that they are an indie company and that is my point They are doing far more than they are capable for a franchise that demands more than they are capable Not to mention Game Freak has been wanting to develop other IPs for years nowBy passing development on to Bandai Namco Pokmon gets the highquality development it needs and Game Freak is no longer pressured under insane time constraints Its a winwin
2023-12-01T05:51:17+0000,Why Bandai Namco Why not just hire more people for Game FreakPokemon companyThough oh god thank you for bringing up performance issues in TotK Ive had them WAY more in that game than in SV exceptionthe lake The lake is slowdown central and despite VIDEO EVIDENCE people still act like Im lyingAnyway more on topic I was surprised how SMALL so many mons are Gosh Id be tripping over them every day if they were real
2023-12-01T10:08:54+0000,I was surprised that there wasnt a more obvious Rooster of Barcelos Pokemon added I suppose Skeledirge is suspected to be partially inspired by it and Skeledirge is awesome but I did think there was going to be a bigger role referencing that story
2023-12-02T22:47:21+0000,I think Skeledirge is a more of a pinata version of the rooster The only bird attribute is limited to his nose flame and the bird that appears when Skeledirge uses the Torch Song
2023-12-02T23:09:21+0000,Its inspired by a few things probably The cocollona and various other mythological creatures the rooster or barcelos being only a partial possible inspiration for the bird bit My point was more that I thought there would be more of a clear Rooster of Barcelos Pokemon
2023-12-03T07:01:58+0000,What about Hawlucha or HoOh for that role Both are colorful red birds
2023-12-03T18:30:50+0000,Hooh is more various different phoenixs and isnt catchable in Scarlet or Violet yet and isnt native to Paldea Hawlucha is more lucha libre and is based on hawks rather than roosters Neither really fit and neither fit the mythology
2023-12-17T19:39:48+0000,One thing I came through in the Terarium that really surprised me was a blatant Lion King referenceIf you run along the border between the Canyon and Savanna biomes youll see on the Savanna side a big rock that looks identical to the Pride Rock At the end of it there will be a male Pyroar looking at his kingdomHe will even completely ignore you so you need to start a battle with it instead of it running at you like usual Pyroar
2023-12-17T20:02:55+0000,So with the Indigo Disk I can now add the disturbing knowledge that the Magby line are covered in hair
2023-12-17T21:34:28+0000,Same here Can say that about a lot of mons actually
2023-12-20T12:43:32+0000,After the Indigo Disk DLC update Id say that flying all over the place aboard Miraidon is one of my new favorite things In the previous post I was appreciating how cool it is to have a large view of the Padea region by giving a look from the top of Glaseado Mountain Well now this feature makes the view even better
2023-12-20T13:21:07+0000,Yeah flying is really nice Also happy they put a nice surprise on top of the Terarium Core for those curious about flying up there
2023-12-20T19:32:57+0000,Not sure if this counts but the fact that the Epilogue part of the dlc is coming out on my birthday is something that surprises me
2023-12-27T13:38:31+0000,Auto Heal is the most underrated QoL improvement Its one of those when you playing older games you dont realise how much you miss it Hopefully they refine it next gen and allow it to heal status and reviveAlso outdoor Pokemon Centre similar scenario being so used to it dont realise how cumbersome it is in previous games to keep going back entering a building healing up
2023-12-28T18:37:39+0000,Not much from a gameplay thing but something I just found out todayGrusha is A dude I dunno if it was just an impression or I misread something but I was completly sure he was a ladyDarn after all those years of anime and always being quick to pick those things up cant believe itd come the day where Id be fooled lol
2024-01-06T22:35:48+0000,I figured that the professors were sus pretty much the moment we got their names considering their names meant Past and Future instead of some sort of tree like literally every other core series professor What really surprised me was the twist that the professors were Life Model Decoys and the originals were killed a decade ago
2024-01-29T14:16:18+0000,His design didnt fool me We already had a female Ice Gym leader in Galar just a few year But they are uncommonKanto Lorelei Elite 4 exclusiveJohto PriceHoenn Glacia Elite 4 exclusiveSinnoh CandiceUnova Brycen Exclusive in Black 1White 1He seems to prefer uses dark and steel in Pokestar StudiosKalos Wulfric only other instance of same gender copying specialist in very next gameAlola Only game that has no Ice Gym Leader and no Ice Totem eitherGalar Melony Shield only
2024-01-31T02:10:08+0000,Not nearly that long They were probably alive when Arven tried to reach them in the incident that got Mabostiff injured The implication is that they died either in the incident that the paradox dragon was fleeing from at the beginning of the game or soon before that since it left a power imbalance between the dragons
2024-02-19T23:32:29+0000,Im surprised at how great the selection of grass type Pokemon was in SV The grass starter is good there were a lot of good grass types available in Paldea some more good ones added in the DLC new and old I never really cared for the grass type but Im liking it this gen
2024-03-18T23:41:28+0000,To be honest I am surprised just how big Paldea really isI didnt notice it in my first playthrough because I just went wherever the missions were Now in my second playthrough Im doing a lot more exploring and Im finally realizing that the region really is huge This is particularly the case when youre exploring without all of KoraidonMiraidons riding abilitiesThere is truly a way to get to every town and every area in the game from the start you just have to find them I recently found this large winding path that takes you from Medali to the Glaseado Gym and directly behind that gym is a cliff that drops you right into Montenevera I didnt notice all of this in my first playthrough because by the time I made it to Montenevera I had already unlocked the Glide and Climb features Thus I had no need to go around the mountains
2024-03-19T11:28:09+0000,I found that out rather quickly after exploring Glaseado I had fought Grusha before Ryme and while I had previously gone to Montenevera to get to Glaseado I accidentally found the slope leading back after I missed a jump with Miraidon and started to slide down the mountain
2024-03-19T20:56:10+0000,The best place to explore is the Poco Path and surrounding area There is so much we miss because were busy doing what the tutorial tells us to do
2023-06-01T09:45:59+0100,Oh my god why do they make such a big deal about being able to pin the map to north but you still cant pin the MINI MAP to north Come on thats the one were looking at all the timeAlso the incredibly fast text speed the friend group has in the crater is just inexcusable I read REALLY fast and it was still too fast for me What in the world why cant it be timed like every other bit of dialogue in the game where it changes to the next line when we say it does
2023-06-02T13:44:22+0100,Even worse is when a wild Pokmon engages a battle with you in mid conversation and it continues to be spoken and by the time you get out the conversation is either near the end or has ended I missed out on some really important info about Arvens backstory about his relationship with his parent because of this and the conversation literally ended as soon as I escaped the battle He was saying something about how the Professor would annoy him by doing something which I could get to see because the wild Pokmon battle animation began and the screen cut to a Raichu immediately with a message saying Wild Raichu has appeared
2023-06-03T21:11:39+0100,When you get into battle with an entire herd of some pokemon but end up having to battle all of them one by one Even if you run another will attack straight away While this did happen in legends arceus the fact that you could move in battle escape was much simpler
2023-06-03T22:29:14+0100,Oh god and they put such an emphasis on his story and put a lot of work into making it so good but then people will miss so much Even if you go out of your way to read the journals which a lot of players dont for some reason if you miss the super speedy dialogue youre still missing the full story And its such a good and impactful story Its clear that they had a lot of real effort in making that story top notch But rrrrghI wonder if the script writers were pissed at whoever decided to zoom though that text
2023-06-03T23:38:49+0100,VeluzaI like to pin the next raid location in the map so I can there while riding Koraidon but whenever Im crossing the rivers this thing spawns it ends up annoying me with forced encounters Gets worse when the game gets slower duo the framerates issueNow thats a species I wont mind seeing Dexitd on gen 10
2023-06-04T02:53:43+0100,I love Veluza but I think I only love them because I first came across one in a mountain pond and it was just the one of them I didnt yet know the horror of the constant barrage of dimwitted psychic fish
2023-06-04T04:20:10+0100,Theyre so bad that I ignore any outbreaks that occur in water Spend too much time running and fighting those instead of what Im actually looking for
2023-06-04T09:51:01+0100,No voice for characters we need it really we have 2023Aggresive water pokemon all they like shark in petroidVaporeon supremacy in mass outbreak really Nintedo did you know Vaporeon is not ONLY ONE EeveeelutionOp Eevee Evolution in raid they make what they want
2023-06-04T11:54:44+0100,I umI dont think you guys understand what I was asking for This isnt about small gripes or things the game is missing and no we do not need voice actinggood god I do not trust this fanbase to not harass the actors either Im asking about actually annoying stuff
2023-06-04T14:15:26+0100,And yet something being actually annoying is HIGHLY dependent upon each individuals own perception and therefore highly variable Because everyone is different and level of annoyance of something is not a concrete or consistent thing unlike say color or size what could be just a small gripe for you could be actuallyhighly annoying for someone else and viceversa and because of this there is no fair or appropriate way to enforce which complaints are actually annoying and which are notTLDR Youve created an opinionbased thread not a factbased one and you cannot sayjudge that one opinion is more right or wrong than others
2023-06-05T08:09:43+0100,How many of these things though are things that SERIOUSLY annoyed you versus just being minor gripes
2023-06-05T12:35:15+0100,You still dont get it You even gave a contradiction of your own above when you said you love Veluza after someone else posted about hating them but here let me give some examples of my ownYou know how the minimap is apparently a SERIOUS annoyance of yours particularly how youre unable to pin it to north Yeah I could genuinely honestly not care less about that as it doesnt bother me in the slightest and Im just appreciative of having a minimapAlso youre probably aware of how some people get sooooooooooooo seriously bent out of shape over the forced Exp Share always being on Guess what Im one of those who truly appreciates this feature because as a busy adult with a wife a house two dogs a full time career and eventually children I dont have time to grind like I would in the old days This feature also grants me the opportunity to easily try out new Pokmon even later on in my playthroughAnd before you jump down my throat saying I must just love everything there are still things that actually annoy me such as raids of 5 stars being in my opinion much more difficult to succeed in solo without specific Pokmon strategies And yes this does SERIOUSLY annoy me when I find a raid I really want such as Walking Wake andor Iron Leaves that took several days and some luck to finally captureI can also agree with Janejane on the degree of annoyance for no interiors and personally am still very irritated that there is STILL no permanent autosort for PC Boxes andor Pokmon HomeLastly I find it incredibly annoying and slightly offensive just how much you use oh my god or oh god in your postscomments but as Im trying to help you understand thats clearly a phrase that doesnt bother you in the slightest because everyone has different opinions and every opinion is just as valid as any other
2023-06-05T14:45:39+0100,As someone has stated previously in this thread this is an opinion based question What is a minor gripe to you could be something incredibly annoying to someone else There really is no right or wrong answerFor example Veluza is one of the most annoying Pokmon in this game for meway more annoying than Sharpedo was in the Isle of Armour For you you stated you like Veluza Both answers are totally fine Opinions are just that
2023-06-05T18:32:55+0100,Brrrrr i havent encountered a Veluza yet but it still makes me get the chills aboutthose damned Sharpedos in the Island of Armor oceans
2023-06-05T18:57:21+0100,I dont like that Pokmon cry out after they knock out an opponent especially in a Double Battle Its cool the few first times but get a bit annoying the more it happens
2023-06-05T19:58:08+0100,You can turn it off I did that with the menu buttons in Gen 9 Sheesh so loud even on low volume
2023-06-05T20:19:20+0100,You can Guess you learn something new everyday Thanks for letting me know Ill have to change that next time I play because I will go crazy if I here Skeledirges cry again
2023-06-05T20:54:48+0100,Its better than having to find the headset from a old man in the third city if i remember correctly before Fire Gym in Gen 8
2023-06-05T21:14:28+0100,That was such a needlessly obtuse way to access a key feature
2023-06-05T22:23:40+0100,you can speed up your swimming by pressing the left analogue Koraidon swims a lot faster than Veluza if you do this
2023-06-06T12:51:21+0100,Oh So thats why I dont have trouble with Veluza unless I accidentally run into one because I couldnt see it from a distance and I collide with it Im always holding down the left analog stick out of habit to traverse faster
2023-06-06T13:38:37+0100,Following Pokemon unable to keep up with you and therefore end up back in the ballI appreciate the accuracy for certain Pokemon speeds but even if walking there should like a set locator for them so they dont fall behind and keep a current paceAlso perhaps faster Pokemon should be set to follow beside you instead of behind
2023-06-06T14:08:26+0100,i hate not being able to turn battle animations off
2023-06-06T15:45:48+0100,I have a opposite the lack of battle animations are not shown in raid battles and the terastallization animation not activating or is heavily delayedAlso if on my second playthrough i tried going after Kofus gym instead of Iono as third but compared to her level 25 teamKofu is actually level 35 and the wild pokemon outside his city are in the level 40 range and if you catch anyone it wont obey of course because of low levelsThis is a opposite of a open game not adapting the gyms compared to your levels Tulip is also this her pokemons are near level 50 while Larrys is barely in the level 40s if i remember correctlyId prefer if the games would try to adapt like Brock did in the anime where he actually asked Red how many badges he had beforehand as a reason for which pokemons he would use Giovanni did the same in that anime choosing which ones on his team were strongest
2023-06-06T15:54:34+0100,Miraidon and Koraidon can also jump but are they faster than the RotomBike
2023-06-06T18:55:51+0100,This brings up another point for me The speed can be an issue even more this gen when walking with a Pokemon as its now part of an evolution method It can make those Pokemon a much longer process to evolve eg Pawmo to Pawmot
2023-06-06T18:58:04+0100,Id say about the same They can definitely outrun faster Pokmon wandering around but without any Sharpedo automatically targeting you and it being nearly impossible to outrun them in SV there is no way to be sure
2023-06-06T19:20:49+0100,I hate checking a Pokemons habitat in the Pokedex unlike previous generations it shows where the Pokemon lives on the map but not where YOU are currently on the map You also cant zoom in on the map to get a better look at the area of habitation You also dont have stamps to mark things on the map Yeah you can mark a destination but only one at a time What if you want to mark multiple locations to get all of your Gimighoul chests in one go
2023-06-06T19:24:06+0100,What I do is mainly fly to every watchtower and see if there is a Gimmighoul there Paldeas Highest Peak has one on top of the sign daily so thats also a must go to location for Coins
2023-06-06T20:53:15+0100,Gimighoul is definitely a one of the worst challenges I bought the game on launch day and i only have335coins screamsDoes Gholdengo register into the pokedex if you get one in a trade
2023-06-06T21:57:15+0100,Yes I got a hacked one through surprise trade I traded it to my other profile for the dex entry then released it
2023-06-07T00:11:58+0100,Thanks thats REALLY helpful I might do it for the annoying ones that only evolve while traversing maps in the online modeI already finished Pawmot but i dont know about Brambleghast
2023-06-07T15:11:59+0100,Yeah at least with Sharpedo you could see it coming from relatively far which gives plenty of time to dodge or at least plan for itSometimes Veluza even cross the start of the border in the land areaTrue but thing is sometimes I like crossing the routes on normal speed mostly to hoard for items And with the ocean routes its easy to miss if you go too fast
2023-06-07T15:45:48+0100,I think finding the Stakes to unlock the Ruins of Legend rather annoying I am missing one to get ChienPao which is one of the two that I actually want to use and for the life of me I cant figure where it is I am using an onl8ne guide that is rather accurate with a map with the markings where the Stakes are hidden and how to reach them but I spent two hours going in literal circles and looking exactly where the guide says to look and I still cant find the last Stake I want to get it so that I can move on to getting the other two
2023-06-09T18:38:06+0100,Paradox Pokmon are the most annoying thing the franchise has ever created Its more annoying than the funny Tera hatsI also hate that they take unique dex number Those dex slot could have gone to a real new Pokmon and we could have gotten a much better Paldea dex Choices
2023-06-11T18:45:30+0100,Theyre no different than the ultra beasts ultimately A group of stronger than normal Pokemon No different to the convergent Pokemon weve seen in PaldeaGiven Paldea has one of the larger exes amongst the last few gens this is a nonsense complaintIf you want an all only new Pokemon Pokedex youll be left waiting because I think every game since Alola has made it clear that Game Freak want to reinvent some of the older Pokemon each generation Thats a given now
2023-06-11T19:46:04+0100,Well at least the case of ultra beasts they are actually new designs and not just reimagined or reskinned versions of older pokemonWhat Im complaining about is paradoxes taking up unique dex numbers instead of just being considered as forms similar to Regional Variants
2023-06-11T22:33:00+0100,ToedscoolToedscruel and WiglettWugtrio take up dex entries and are basically the same thing If youre okay with these four Pokmon you cant complain about the Paradox Pokmon Different categories but amounting to the same thing
2023-06-11T23:18:41+0100,Diglett is based on a mole Wigglet is based on garden eel Tentacruel is based on jellifish Toedscruel is based on mushroomsMeanwhile Delibird and Iron Bundle are both based on a penguinTheres a difference there
2023-06-11T23:37:39+0100,You cannot be seriousWigglet is based on Diglet Wugtrio is based on Dugtrio Same for ToedscruelTentacruelToedscoolTentacool Theyre new interpretations of the original PokmonIron Bundle is based on Delibird in the exact same wayIts the same thing categorised differently for the purpose of the Pokdex and storylineCannot believe you are arguing there is a difference between them frankly
2023-06-12T10:17:12+0100,Pokmon being too small for me to see them in the wildBeing forced to use those awful preppy kids uniformsNew shinies being barely any differentNew evolutions being barely any differentCharacters describing ugly places as beautifulThe complete lack of level scaling for gymsHaving to use EV reducing berries once again aswell as having limited options to raise EVsEach of the three routes repeating essentially the same cutscene for most of the game with only a few little changesBattles taking too long to startAll TMs being breakable and the whole crafting system in general
2023-06-12T11:33:57+0100,Honestly I am generally fine the crafting aspect but I dont like how hard it is to get some of the materials necessary for some of the better TMs They should have stuck with non breakable TMs being found in various locations and have us craft TRs which do break but are some of the more commonly used moves such as Brick Break or Substitute
2023-06-12T11:48:59+0100,If they werent given their own dex numbers Paldeas dex would simply end on 1000 instead of 1015Its not like we would get 15 new Pokmon if the Paradox were treated as forms without their own dex numbers
2023-06-12T13:37:48+0100,I thinkTMs should always be unbreakableIn this game the pokemon you are looking for arent guaranteed to spawn and it can depend on time of dayOn my newest gripe i hate that you could get more clothes than uniform styles helmets gloves hair backpacks shoes and version exclusive uniform colors andannoying for those not wanting to buy dlcSword Shield had aamazingvariety of clothes Brilliant Diamond gave us themed clothes sets and a Platinum retro outfit Legends Arceus also had a lot of different outfits including a lot of and garchomp theme kimono and many color choices for all of the clothesLets Go was more limited but your partners can get outfits i didnt use them
2023-06-12T16:01:03+0100,The TM machine is a massive downgrade tbh The unbreakable TMs made putting together squads and useable mons so much easierI reckon using materials to manufactureitems would have been a good thing it was done in SwSh using the Cramorant machine albeit with a lot of randomness but the crafting for materials feels like a step too farAnd to be frank why cant we craft for elixirspotionsetc That would have been more useful by far
2023-06-12T16:08:55+0100,Good grief you are BOTH equally correct in what these new Pokmon are inspired by Copley Hill Gym gave the Pokmonbased inspirations while 1991 gave the realworld inspirations Neither of you are more wrong or right than the other
2023-06-12T17:34:45+0100,Yeah noIm not arguing that theyre not inspired by eels etc I am pointing out that the Paradox Pokemon and Convergent Pokemon amount to the same thingI am also saying that arguing for one group to not have Pokdex entries based on an entirely arbitrary and subjective definition is ridiculousEither way Paradox Pokemon and Convergent Pokemon both have Pokdex entries and that wont change thats an end of it
2023-06-12T21:48:41+0100,The fact that there is no icon on the map detailing the shops or places of interest eg the specific types of shops within the urban settlements other than the Pokemon centres Its something you can cope without of course but it would be useful when you are first getting used to the map to have an icon so you can find the specific shop you are looking for without having to check online or wander around until you find it
2023-06-12T21:49:59+0100,How quickly shinies can despawn in multiplayer Failed a Tatsugiri because of that
2023-06-12T22:38:28+0100,I try to adjust the camera to make pokemon battles look like in previous entries the trainer behind the pokemon but it always cut my character and depending on the size of the pokemon Im using it cuts them as well Not being able to enter buildings in a open world game lol
2023-06-12T23:12:52+0100,Actually theres an option to zoom the map ZRZL button I believe that allows to pick a few key places on cities Mostly shops and restaurants
2023-06-12T23:25:46+0100,That does seem to be the case Probably could be a bit more visible without having to zoom the map but ultimately at least its something
2023-06-12T23:36:02+0100,Veluza being Sharpedo 20 it can make exploring areas where they appear a bit annoying Same goes for Tauros since they tend to spawn in herdsDont mind the crafting TM thing too much though Spiritomb not being a potential raid spawn can make crafting TMs requiring its material a hassle you are limited to a few fixed spawns per day
2023-06-12T23:39:41+0100,It seems like every generation they want to change how we obtain TMs Totally annoying and unnecessary Unlimited TMs is the way to go
2023-06-13T00:52:23+0100,I definitely enjoyed the SwSh approach to TMs above all other games 100 unbreakable TMs with relatively weak moves that help progress through the game and then 100 breakableyet easy to obtainTRs that contained most of the strong and desirable moves I wish this was the SV approach or at least make some of the materials easier to obtain
2023-06-13T00:54:06+0100,I preferred the gen 57 approach All TMs should be reusable If theyre going to make TMs single use again why not bring back HMs too and make us carry a Bibarel around everywhere just for traversal
2023-06-13T01:33:53+0100,Found Tauross to be a bit more of a pain tbh And rather funny Kept on running into me so I try to give them a huge berth
2023-06-13T12:24:20+0100,Just go to watchtowers and maybe grind some I bought the game on June 1st and I think I have more than u
2023-06-13T12:31:29+0100,Ive been able to outrun most Veluza that I see while exploring and if I am attacked by one targeting me its because it sneaked up behind me I could never outrun Sharpedo Tauros I dont mind that they appear in herds as it makes sense given cattle tend to be seen in groups and are social animals What I dont like is how hard it is to find a Blaze or Aqua Breed in the herd Ive literally never found one in the Wild and only have them via trading
2023-06-14T03:04:10+0100,I wish there were better options for EV training in the early game The power items are expensive and you may need multiple of one type of band in order to train a team of six Vitamins are even more expensive and are locked behind gym badges For all the crap that gen 6 gets you will never convince me that Super Training wasnt the best thing since sliced bread
2023-06-14T06:17:18+0100,at least these arent locked behind Battle tower points
2023-06-14T09:51:46+0100,Having zero post game Didnt even have a battle facility
2023-06-14T15:00:18+0100,I think well get a battle facility its just gonna cost us thirty dollars extra
2023-06-14T15:01:57+0100,It will be the first time that I wont get the new dlc Not going to play these laggy and buggy unfinished games
2023-06-14T15:23:28+0100,I dont know where youre getting that they are still lagging They put out an update to the game so it loads less into the frames Obviously sitting in a hoard of Veluza or dropping into the bamboo forest might slow down the game But overall the game performs ok Im not going to rave about its performance but it really isnt terribleBugs It has more than its fair share of bugs Most have been addressed But there are still a few things they need to fix hereUnfinished Yes Entirely The video game industry has evolved in such a way that games are sent out 80 complete and then the remaining 20 is released through DLC Thats how it is now
2023-06-14T22:15:29+0100,The mention on HM slaves on last page made me realize the raidon is pretty much a glorified HM Slave They rock climb swim and even headbutt trees
2023-06-15T10:45:56+0100,Its always easier for some members of the Pokmon community to remain defiantly negative
2023-06-15T11:10:34+0100,The game lags That is not a matter of being too negative its merely a fact proved by countless testers who showed its unable to keep a stable 30fps certainly not just in a few areas even after the update which had some areas performing worseWhether you overlook that lag because you like the game its up to you but lets not spread misinformation and try to gaslight the others by acting like the update fixed it for the most part when it really didnt lmao
2023-06-15T11:15:12+0100,Dont call my Koraidon a slave I have severe emotional attachment to it and you will be severely emotionally damaged
2023-06-15T13:20:43+0100,Hey I love Koraidon too I was just pointing out that in a way the legendary also fills the role of HM slave
2023-06-15T14:01:29+0100,I forgot about that feature I always did enjoy watching the Pokmon hit the punching bag so hard that it flies off screen I think this was the only way Ive ever done any EV training outside of feeding Vitamins to Tyrogue in hopes of getting all three Hitmons
2023-06-15T14:28:17+0100,I actually am with you lets not spread misinformation Totally agreeBut lets also not pretend its so buggy and laggy that its unplayable Weve seen many of those negative voices one in particular on this forum basically complain at every opportunity and downrate the game to an unplayable mess when we know it isnt
2023-06-15T17:01:48+0100,The more ambitious the games are the more glitches will be and a lot of those people point about SV are stuff you expect in any 3D open world although when it comes to low frame rate SV definitely goes beyond what should be allowedWhat I think has become obvious however is that the yearly release schedule of Pokmon games dont allow for games as ambitious as SVYou either make a properly finished open world or you release one game every year You cant do both games of this scale take timeI wonder though if the people who complain endlessly about how unfinished these games are would accept waiting 35 years for a new game Because I seem to remember the same people throwing almost daily tantrums because they had to wait 2 months for news in 2022
2023-06-15T21:26:30+0100,So much thisIn any event I have played far worse games Just replayed the first two gens of Pokemon You want a buggy mess Yet of course I love Red and Silver Excellent games
2023-06-15T21:27:19+0100,Not to mention you power them up with Herba Mystica which literally has HM as its initials which is likely a reference too I think its a fun one off idea to have legends join us early I wouldnt do that every game but I think it works here
2023-06-15T22:10:40+0100,Gen II wasnt so bad with the glitches if you never used the Time Capsule That is where a majority of th3 problems came from
2023-06-16T00:02:03+0100,Breeding being locked into picnic is annoying You cant do anything while waiting for eggs
2023-06-16T02:02:13+0100,I just kick around the ball with Miraidon Ditto whatever Pokmon Im trying to get eggs of
2023-06-16T02:35:06+0100,I generally run around the picnic or I sit my Switch down for a bit
2023-06-16T14:06:33+0100,the fact that most plotrelevant characters got hair streaks but YOU CANT also annoys me without end heres hoping for Arvens hair in the DLC
2023-06-16T15:29:19+0100,I think SV had the best use of the legendary not going to lie He finally feels an actual character and he joining the player feel satisfying
2023-06-17T07:28:25+0100,When I run away from a battle and then immediately the Pokemon attacks me again and Im in the battle screen once more That is annoying
2023-06-17T21:12:02+0100,The fact you cannot buy Ice stones from a shop but you can buy some other evolutionary stones from shops Its not completely the worst thing in the world but it is mildly annoying that they cant be as easily obtained as other stones like the fire stone can be
2023-06-18T01:56:46+0100,I also think that is odd Its not like the Ice Stone wasnt easily bought in a Mart before as LGPE had them for sale and the Pokmon who can evolve with it arent exactly hard to find nor is the list as limited as the Dawn Stone I mean the Thunder Stone went through four generations where only two Pokmon could use it and even then it could be bought
2023-06-19T02:14:56+0100,You can take me off of Miraidon for everything else but picnics are where you draw the line Okay Game Freak
2023-06-19T19:25:00+0100,Ever since the DLC additions were added Ive been unable to do a union circle meet up with my Scarlet Violet games I used to do it no problem for stuff like raid battles mass outbreaks but now I cant have both games playing at the same time even though theyre on separate devices
2023-06-19T20:20:15+0100,Do you have physical or digital copies of the games
2023-06-19T20:48:19+0100,Scarlets digital Violets physical It seems to be working now because when I tried to load Violet it said downloadable content not working
2023-06-19T21:08:59+0100,Cant guarantee itll work but I have both as a digital game and I uninstalled both games when I had the same issue as you Once I downloaded the games back after deleting them the problem was solved Let me know if they worked Ill be happy to help you out
2023-07-09T00:49:07+0100,Id say some of the evolution requirements the fact that I have to take 1000 steps with a Pokmon with the lets go feature that is busted half the time is very frustrating
2023-07-09T04:50:14+0100,Uhh you can walk up and down the academy stairs 10 times and it takes 20 min to do in which you can watch Netflix
2023-07-09T04:52:36+0100,Yes but that was just one example it also doesnt change the fact that its still annoying and frustrating at times
2023-07-09T07:23:40+0100,I ran around Levincia City three times and got it to happen in ten minutes
2023-07-09T17:15:24+0100,I didnt try anything besides keep playing with Pawmo as the leading mon Took a while but I eventually managed itHope process will be easier if it makes the cut on Gen 10 and I do hope it does as Ive been wanting an eletricfighting mon for agesPoGo will make it another case of walk with your buddy to evolve how I hate those
2023-07-09T19:42:42+0100,Not being able to jump Its pain in the butt to retrieve items in places where MiraidonKoraidon cant reach because I cant jump or roll to get to it
2023-07-09T21:36:51+0100,Yep money gouging with unfinished games being bait on fishing rodsBreakable TMTRs are SO ANNOYINGI miss the days when the Alola games were the last to still have unbreakable TMsThe problem with items in any game starting from Legends ArceusGen 9 materials you cant always guarantee the right pokemon you need will spawn and the Gen 9 games wont let you track more than 5 TMsBDSP has a limited ammount of TMs especially SURF Not counting from the ones you can buy in the Veilstone Department Store and theHikers arent easy to find or the items they want for them
2023-07-09T23:13:00+0100,Oh even worse I found the TM Fly atop this steep mountain in Glaseado and the peak was so narrow Miraidon couldnt fit So I had spent half an hour trying to maneuver my way to the tippy tip of that damn mountain peak
2023-07-10T02:33:00+0100,Word Hated that one Koraidon couldnt fit either So it was a fiasco Same with the coins at the top of the mountains
2023-07-10T02:34:36+0100,Where was the TM tho I had 0 trouble getting my Koraidon fitting on Paldeas Highest Peak and that gimmighoul spot near the Leaking Tower
2023-07-10T20:47:51+0100,Never ran into issues with getting places with Koraidon tooBut then Im not that active on farming the Gimmighoul coins
2023-07-10T20:51:46+0100,Gen 6 Legendaries are related to life and deathGen 4 create time and spaceGen 3 create land and seaGen 9 they r bicycles
2023-07-10T21:09:31+0100,Gen 1 they are birdsGen 2 they are dogsGen 5 YuGiOhs Blue Eyes White Dragon Red Eyes Black DragonGen 7 spaceGen 8 wolves horsesAll the legendary Pokmon can be made into generic descriptions Just because the Paradox Cyclizar double as transport does not make them less legendary
2023-07-10T22:21:15+0100,Oh no this was at the top of one of those thin snow pillars on the lower end of Glaseado It was SO difficult to climb
2023-07-10T23:34:55+0100,Now do one with their personalities development and characterizationAlso Mewtwo the OG legendary was just a lab rat And will be forever more iconic and popular not to mention a far superior design than any of those legendaries that need some lifedeathtimespace godly attribute added to help make them remarkable So not really a good parameter
2023-07-11T01:37:16+0100,Ohh can you give me a vague description of the place Imma go check it out
2023-07-11T02:11:27+0100,Bro is so fking Kalos biased The Paldean Legendaries KoraiMiraidon are literally the sons of Terapagos and Dialga and the only reason you can catch multiple are because inuniverse they are the copies imagine mitosis of the true Legendary Why cant Pokemon make positive changes about the Legendary and the player creating a legend of their own And dont call them bicycles Go look into their damn origin before spitting out these blatant complaints like your home bug Spewpa Go devote yourself to Kaleido Star if you think the only good in Pokemon is Kalos or whatever early gens you like
2023-07-11T02:13:09+0100,The overabundance of encounter power electric among the restaurant meals which further pronounces the encounter powers that dont show up at all in those establishmentsLike this isif youre an electric Pokemon enjoyer a bit less so if you just want to grab a quick bite and not go through the hassle of whipping the table out to cram a sandwich down your face
2023-07-11T02:15:56+0100,Yea and the meals are overpriced and filled with random crap but then a 500Pokedollar Sandwich gives you Lv3 buffs Herba Mystica are basically free at this point
2023-07-11T14:22:06+0100,The SV Box Legendaries arent related to Dialga at all Cyclizar is where they came from and Koraidon and Miraidon are just evolved versions of Cyclizar I like to think of this as a Carbink transforming into a Diancie situation where there is a physical change in a relatively common Pokmon into another distinct Pokmon but its not an official evolution as not all Cyclizar will undergo the transformation Koraidon I know is said to be the prehistoric version of Cyclizar but its really more like a prehistoric evolution if anything
2023-07-11T16:35:18+0100,One thing was never established Did Koraidon only exist during ancient times and is during the AncientFuture times but are now trapped protectors in a Paradox situation If they have any connection at all to Cyclizar at allid say it is a forced evolution created by Arceusas if he has determined that something from the dlc stories are a impending threat to Paldea
2023-07-11T21:14:39+0100,Im thinking of something similar as it is very evident that people in Paldea Ride Cyclizar for transportation and even have safety gear for riding the Pokmon yet MiraidonKoraidon just happened to evolve from a Cyclizar without any explanation and it isnt an official evolution as the cause or reason why it had occurred is ever mentioned My guess is it has something to do with the time machine and Paradox Pokmon and there are two of the Box Legendaries because the process happened only twice when no one was looking We know Diancie is created when a Carbink stores enough special energy to cause it to mutate Cosmoem evolves into either Solgaleo or Lunala depending on how much sunlight or moonlight it stores in its body Koraidon and Miraidon seem to be recently discovered Pokmon as there are no mentions of them prior to ten years before the games began
2023-07-11T23:26:53+0100,One slight issue is with that while they are recently brought to the present these KoraidonMiraidon are the ones on the cover of the Scarlet BookViolet book and were seemingly named as the Winged KingIron Serpent This book is apparently around 200 years old not sure on the exact year and while they still may have been created recently I think its explanation I think will be slightly more complicated and tie into that expedition To me this isnt isnt really annoying unless they left it unexplained and given that Arven points it out I think we will get an explanation in the DLC as it seems like a deliberate mystery
2023-07-11T23:47:30+0100,Still Koraidon at least seems primal in design Perhaps Koraidon was brought back was a from a Winged King fossil guardian that went extinct Miraidon is probably way more advanced revival of a similar fossil but technology was used to create itBut what caused it to be sent to the present is a mystery
2023-07-12T00:37:07+0100,What caused them to be in the present is due to the time machine SadaTuro invented at least according to the AI and is backed up by TuroSadas journals According to them they believe that KoraidonMiraidon was brought from another period in time PastFuture The AI is fairly upfront with us on how they think the machine that they helped build worksI have my own speculation how i think it works but until the DLC is out its hard to be certain based purely on the information currently in the game and without leaning into rumours which is a whole other topic
2023-07-12T01:32:06+0100,You dont need to get off your ride to get that one The collision detection in this game is pretty forgiving as long as youre reasonably close to it you can pick it up
2023-07-12T01:53:26+0100,Lmao theyre not actually the sons of Dialga its that they arent bicycles and actually affect time so yeah connection to Dialga because he controls time so the raidons essentially are closer to Dialga than other mons
2023-07-12T02:40:18+0100,As someone who has used Eelektross in a playthrough they definitely had it float too close to the ground Sometimes it goes through the ground especially when it uses a move like Flash Cannon Its face goes directly into the ground while performing that move
2023-07-12T03:08:10+0100,I tried it For half an hour Didnt work lolI mean if it worked for you congrats But it aint work for me
2023-07-12T12:07:08+0100,Not being able to rematch the Elite FourNo battle towerBreakable TMs once again
2023-07-12T12:13:50+0100,The TMs breaking I dont mind since we can craft our own at any time as long as we have the recipe and materials required I dont like Thunder Wave or Confuse Ray and having the option to just ignore them is nice and I do like creating the TMs for Moonblast and Drain Punch multiple times You fight a lot of Pokmon while exploring anyway so TMs being useable only once isnt too bad
2023-07-12T14:25:38+0100,I always thought TM should be oneuse only until you beat the game to avoid cheapening the game by loading your Pokmon with an overpowered setBut once you beat the game they should become infiniteuse Theres no reason to keep it onetime only once the game is over
2023-07-12T15:37:31+0100,Or maybe they could have de AI be more intelligent have better attacks and stats plus higher levels Even with giving the player access to better attacks they could still be a challenge
2023-07-12T21:44:16+0100,This isnt purely a ScarletViolet specific thing but I wish the judge function was available from the start of the game I dont really see a reason why you cant know the strength of your pokemon from the getgo It would give players more options when training their pokemon if they knew their stats
2023-07-13T02:21:26+0100,They should also implement the difficulty option from BW2 and have it be available from the start
2023-07-13T17:48:56+0100,This is a nitpick but the Pokemon league rooms in Unova and Kalos are so beautiful while in Scarlet and Violet its just a plain room No epicness or charm whatsoever Maybe that was the idea since it represents school
2023-07-13T23:04:36+0100,I know this has been covered before and theres been a Mod come in butThey are bicyclesNo theyre Subtle difference If you play the game and get into it you feel fond of your steed Maybe this resonated with me more being a horse rider in my spare time but Koraidon in particular felt like a steed They basically made an Epona for Pokemon and that was no bad thing The Titan storyline involving the Herba Mystica HMs ha ha gave some more depth of story and feeling to the game and the new legendaries
2023-07-13T23:26:04+0100,Koraidon became my favorite legendary Hands downHe might not be the coolestlooking ever but the story made his bond with the MC truly remarkable
2023-07-18T20:10:50+0100,battle form Koraidon is one of the coolest critters theyve come up with in my opinionsomething that annoys me is that your dorm room remains bare even after all your adventures I expected at least to get our picture with Penny Nemona Arven and Koraidon put in the frame
2023-07-18T20:39:32+0100,Or better yet all of the selfies that were taken after defeating each Gym Titan and Team Star Boss They put so much effort and detail in them to be wasted on something that can only be seen once
2023-07-23T01:12:54+0100,I am not a Fan of ScVi semirealistic ArtstyleThey should have stayed 3D AnimeCel Shade
2023-07-23T01:27:15+0100,Be nice if we could customize our dorm room like a secret base
2023-07-24T02:19:06+0100,This will probably be a null complaint when it eventually releases but Im kind of annoyed on how the DLC is seemingly focusing on new characters and not your buddies in the base game Id particularly want Arven to be relevant since its about Area Zero and I want more info on Geeta the opposite professor and Heath which well probably getIm at least hoping they implement gym leaders in the DLC areas like how they did for SwShThe amount of two stage families when some of them look like mid stages I like Scovillain but I think it looks like a mid stage evo and we need a yellow pepperNo Starmie
2023-07-24T03:21:46+0100,Perhaps they feel that their character arcs are done after all the area zero team star gym challenge stuff but maybe theyll get a cameo in the DLC Now that I think about it SwordShield DLC mostly focused on new characters aside from Oleana having a cameo in the Crown Tundra and the Gym Leaders appearing all over Isle of Armor
2023-07-24T04:09:07+0100,Thats true but IoA and CT were disconnected from the main story Hidden Treasures of Area Zero is connected to the main story of SV
2023-07-24T19:19:50+0100,The lack of a blank plate It just seems weird to have all regular plates other than that one I know some people say its not needed as Arceus doesnt need it as its already normal type but I think there would be some use
2023-07-24T19:45:46+0100,Given that all of the other plates increase the strength of moves of their type there is an argument for the inclusion of that plate It does overlap with the Silk Scarf but the other plates overlap with the other type items
2023-07-24T19:50:53+0100,I sort of find it annoying that I keep finding the TM for Thunder Wave on the ground I despise that attack and wont teach it to any of my Pokmon and if any of the know it due to learning the move as one of their first four slots then I try to get rid of it as soon as I possibly can Same with Confuse Ray although I might keep it if the user can learn an attack that gets additional effects from the target having a status condition and because of possible damage in between turns
2023-07-24T20:02:38+0100,Im curious Why do you hate Thunder Wave I tend to use that sort of attack to catch pokemon
2023-07-24T20:18:31+0100,Every time I use it the paralysis never makes the target unable to move Ive lost so many Gym battles because of that Yet whenever the AI uses it on my Pokmon they can never move and lose the entire match I lost to Lance in Crystal once because he swept my entire team with his first Dragonite because of Thunder Wave and I had a full team at max health all unable to move because of paralysis I only took out Gyarados and then became unable to even inflict 1 HP of damage because of stupid Thunder Wave
2023-07-25T04:45:24+0100,Yes i so hate confuse ray no matter who uses them But Fantina Crashers Wakes Floatzel Crasher Wakes Gyaradoss Water Pulse Hoenn E4 Phoebe and Unova E4 Shauntal are the worst
2023-07-27T17:07:51+0100,One thing that really irritates me is how Maschiffs dex entry literally mentions its thick fat but it does not have the ability Thick Fat
2023-08-08T22:57:56+0100,They removed basic content ex battle facility and story elements ex any remote lore explaining what makes the box arts legendary of the game that every previous major mainline series game had as a default Basic staples of the game every previous entry either had right from the get go or with like 1 free update just to repackage it as 35 DLC People are having to pay 95 to get the same levels of content previous entries had for 40
2023-08-09T02:04:35+0100,Battle facility was basic content In what game Its always postgame Even in HGSS where you can access it early they wont let you competeAnd they explained the box art legendaries In all the years of pulling creatures through time only two of these ever came through indicating theyre at the very least extremely rare in the future And heck being really really rare was good enough for the legendary birds of Kanto yeah
2023-08-09T02:27:22+0100,Postgame that I didnt have to pay extra for It was already in the base game you just had to unlock it of course
2023-08-13T05:51:42+0100,Having certain Pokemon be limited events ie Iron Leaves Walking WakeIt sucks for anyone who prefers to take their time and not rush in a game or for those who rent games
2023-08-13T07:48:27+0100,But Iron Leaves and Walking Wake didnt drop until three full months after ScarletViolet debuted and theyve been repeated periodically since have they not Whats the threshold at which anyone who prefers to take their time and not rush has been deemed to have had enough time to prepareAnd Pokmon is simply not a game that can be effectively played if someone only rents it periodically how are they to somehow factor that in as well
2023-08-13T08:08:53+0100,I dont think Walking Wake and Iron Leaves are going to be only tied to that one event anywayEspecially since Raging Bolt and Iron Crown are found in the DLCThey were also found to have deleted Pokedex entries in the datamine and many Pokemon in that list have been confirmed for DLC
2023-08-13T13:34:06+0100,I hope so Because trying to get them via Home is impossible
2023-08-13T19:07:23+0100,When the raids were first announced they stated that they would appear again so the train has definitely not passed But I agree that there is a good chance that they will appear in the DLC as nonraid encounters as well
2023-09-25T01:26:40+0100,When I first visited the paldea league I didnt felt inspired to battle with this government looking office
2023-10-04T09:38:21+0100,I am pleased that the very first item in this thread not being able to pin the minimap to north was remedied with the DLC Now I can navigate like a true free adventurer always knowing where Im going
2023-10-04T20:09:28+0100,That really struck me as unfinished I think they planned to have voice acting for that part it would have worked so well Seems like they blew the budget on Ed Sheeran thoughI am just now getting serious about EVIVs It was a let down to find almost all of my mons are all rated just OK I was pretty excited to see some rated as amazing and great so Im going to start EV training them But yeah I wish I had had the benefit of getting good ratings earlyIm hoping this is an asset library problem Each successive generation built on the previous generations assets so they could copy assets and make new variations For the Switch the workload exploded The modeling has to be more detailed so you get all sorts of new tasks maybe trying to salvage old models but also highresing textures increased algorithmic complexity anchor points for tera crowns move animations for each mon And all of it has to be done while contemporaneously upgrading the game engine I can imagine that not all tricks that work to make things look nice in 2D25Disometric are going to work for 3D These last few generations on the Switch remind me of how gen 1 in that its rough outlines of a much richer and enjoyable game They probably do need to slow the release cycle thoughAs for me this isnt theannoying but it was kind of a let down in postpostgamewhen you go back to the depths of Area Zero and see aidon you cant interact with it I think that wouldve been fun to rebattle or have some kind of interaction with themAlso wish it was possible to do multiple map markings like what can be done in PLA Especially right now since Im not ready for five star raids being able to mark it as such on the map would be nice
2023-10-04T23:45:24+0100,Not sure whether not having the judge function until the postgame is out of fear people will adopt a Paullike mindset when viewing their Pokemon as numbers rather than pals Bottle Caps do exist but Hyper Training only really becomes an option in the late or postgame they are quite pricy even with the required level dropped to 50 that is pretty much lategame levels
2023-10-05T00:37:49+0100,yeah it seems to me most games avoid giving you the option to micromanage too much stuff until late game or even New GameMicromanaging is something that usually ruins the immersion so I guess developers want to avoid people treating every step they take on the game as a chore that must be optimized then blaming the game for not being fun
2023-10-05T06:58:18+0100,As far as voice acting why would they only have it in one single partAs far as the spoiler thereSpoilerwhat do you mean cant interact with it If you mean the second paradox dragon the Guardian of Paradise yes you can You engage with it and can catch it I have a video where I do it if you need proofI engage it at about the 28 minute mark
2023-10-06T02:22:15+0100,The freaking angles while battling It ruins the immersion why cant it be set like LGPE or even SS
2023-10-06T04:33:56+0100,A lot of games will do a mixture of both some scenes with voice acting and some scenes without My noevidencewhatsoever speculation is that they didnt have enough time to rework the dialog before release It would have been cool to have voice dialog with the Arven Nemona and Penny through out the gameI found out about theGuard of Paradisea few minutes ago and knew there would be a reply waiting for me about it I guess I didnt engage with it by pressing A
2023-10-08T19:03:05+0100,the fact that you can enter a wild battle literally directly after having just finished one makes me syo mad when im trying to avoid them
2024-01-03T05:15:16+0000,The annoying thing at least for me is the lack of store interiors and always having to squeeze by pokemon encounters of pokemon spawn anywhere near where you battleI missed where the stores have a kind of personality to them instead of just a simple menu Yeah we have the interiors of certain sandwich stores but yeah
2024-03-12T19:58:16+0000,Getting the EXP Charm in the Teal Mask as early as you do and being unable to switch off its effects Once I have it my team levels up way too fast and ends up trampling all over the major battles in midtolate game and everything becomes a bit too easy until you start the Indigo Disk
2024-03-12T22:18:25+0000,A barren open world with nothing but pokemon to fight no interesting sights or secret areas to find Its not even just the lack of side quests its the lack of people existing in Paldea Everyone that isnt a trainer is holed up in the cities and towns No team star goons to bump into no traveling merchants nothing Trainer NPCs have set locations and are sprinkled around the areas but theres also only a dozen or so if not less of them per area So you end up with like 90 of every area just having nothing to it no incentive for players to stick around and try to find cool hidden things you can just move straight to your next destination and thats it It also doesnt help that a lot of the environment can feel similar and even the names of the areas are blanduninspired with the Area One South Province
2024-03-13T12:16:43+0000,And u cant even enter buildings when you are in the citiesI didnt touch this game for a year and its going to stay like that
2024-03-15T16:09:59+0000,I feel the same way got discouraged to keep playing after defeating the league and Im not buying those DLCs either
2024-03-16T10:18:49+0000,Same why would I buy a DLC when the base game is full of low frame rates lags and bugs
2024-03-17T19:42:03+0000,Raid bosses that literally nosell your efforts even when you have the right counter and they take minuscule damage on from your super effective damagewhen it is a lowly 5 star or 6 I can understand the occasional need for it on 7 star events thoughI absolutely hate when i forget what weakness a Tera type is I has can attest to often using a wrong pokemon since i was sure it would workBut when the game decides thatonly fighting is effective on Ground type on a Garchompwhen GrassWaterIce would work but the boss shrugs it offFighting is not a common used counter on Ground in the base game
2024-04-20T09:38:53+0100,The new characters in the DLC are all annoying especially that emo kid
2024-04-20T10:25:24+0100,Amarys I thought was pretty cool on a few different levels
2024-04-20T11:51:22+0100,The fact that sometimes but not always connecting to the internet resets all the raid densThere have been so many times where Ive come to a raid thought That would be a good Pokmon to have but Ill probably need help from actual people to beat it only for the raid to disappear when I switch to online mode
2024-04-20T11:59:17+0100,Yea thats annoying Whats the point of it if youre not able to get help online with it
2024-04-21T06:44:32+0100,Most likely if you still have data for a raid event that has officially ended the forced raid den reset once you go online is to remove all the event dens from your map along with the data for said dens Not sure whether that is also the case for outbreak events
2024-04-21T22:16:14+0100,I only dislike Kieran Sure he is a growing kid or teenager But his attitude doesnt seem like a good a personality to respect Ogerpon or Terapagos or a Elite 4 ChampionHis sister is Carmine is a lot more mature despite being wary of outsiders and hiding it behind her angerOgerpon had a tragic and terrifying backstory and Terapagos showed it could be destructive in its final Stellarized form
2024-05-18T18:08:53+0100,I think its just the Pokemon Centers for meBeing outdoor gas stations although thematic are not practical for being a resting spot for trainers and a minihub to rest and shop atI am hoping next gen does allow more interior buildings
2024-06-16T00:42:15+0100,1 Veluza Its one of the most annoying Pokemon Ive ever come across since they ambush you easily and theyre hard to avoid in watery areas late in the games I thought the Sharpedo in the Isle of Armor were annoying but Veluza is so much worse lol2 The lack of building interiors It began to bug me after a while because it makes exploring cities and towns so boring Most towns are just a Pokemon Center or two and a ton of food shops now Even interacting with NPCs is basically pointless in these games since very few of them give you items 3 The fact that some Eeveelutions like Vaporeon are so common while a few others like Sylveon or Umbreon are much rarer Vaporeon is basically found inlake late in the games4 The way some Pokemon spawn right behind you I cannot even count how many times I stood idle for a few seconds completely sure that no Pokemon were in my vicinity only to have one pop up and ambush me when I least expect it5 The size of the region kinda grinds my gears Its huge but theres nothing really that interesting to explore It wouldve been nice if there were an occasional plot relevant building here and there to visit outside of cities and towns but all you get is grassy areas trees rivers and lakes and an occasional ruin Oh and a boring ocean that only has like 7 evolutionary lines of Pokemon in it It gets boring after a while when the vast majority of the map is so bleak6 Not the most annoying aspect but the treasures of ruin Legendaries are frustrating to unlock Ive seen people compare them to the Regis but I still think translating braille is easier and more fun than having to find 32 stakes
2024-06-27T00:17:46+0100,I thought about this and I wish more of the Pokemon programmed in the game were obtainableI halfway dont care if its via a tera event but like wheres my Enamorus
2024-07-14T04:38:19+0100,When I accidentally run into a pokemon and it makes me battle them then leave the battle instead of backing up away from them like when youre flying and accidentally collide into oneWe can only go inside a few housesThey dont tell you how to hatch eggs specifically I still dont understand it and I miss the daycareIt loads when you want to fly out of the main city and it doesnt do that with anything elseWhen I was playing the dlcs there was a lot of things I had to look up or find out myself because they didnt tell you what to do after something happenedNo one in the game told me about paradox pokemon I just found out about them a couple days agoWe cant exit the continue part of tera raids if you accidentally click it or you decide you dont want to do it anymore and you have to wait for it to finish loading
2024-07-14T12:36:32+0100,To get eggs you need to1 start a picnic with just the two Pokemon you want to breed2 make a sandwich with Egg Power The best ones from my experience are the Ultra Peanut Butter which needs butter jam banana and peanut butter Ultra Marmalade cheese butter marmalade and cream cheese and Ultra Pickle pickle basil olive oil and watercress3 Once your Pokemon have eaten the sandwich the Egg Power effect lasts for 30 minutes Stay in the picnic for a while and keep checking the basket at the picnic table It may take time for an egg to appear but it eventually will You may get a few eggs if you check the basket enough timesAlso when it comes to unlocking new sandwich recipes each time you earn a Gym Badge you need to go into one of the Every Wich Way sandwich shops in any town speak to the fat guy standing by the counter saying New Sandwiches and hell give you the recipes
2024-07-16T12:17:13+0100,Thank you so much this helped me a lot I appreciate it
2024-07-23T03:23:51+0100,I dont like how breeding works in these games I hate basically being forced to use egg powers since eggs are really hard to obtain otherwise Its just a time consuming system compared to the old way of breedingAlso I hate Draytons trial You dont get told that youll need to raise Pokemon caught in the Terarium until you talk to Drayton at his battle location so you have to go out and train a decent team to defeat the trial trainers before battling him which is a hassle even with Chansey running around If theyd at least foreshadowed this when you first get to the Terarium it wouldnt be a problem but they just spring it on you after youve probably spent hours hanging out there
2024-07-24T15:58:50+0100,Agreed That rule came out of nowhere but i used rare candies from online raids to ease the pain I can understand how the game doesnt want players to steamroll over Drayton with importedcaught before The Indigo Disk came out At least the pokemon near Drayton arent too ridiculously low leveled XDFinding the Rockruff with the Hidden Ability to get the Dusk Form Lycanroc in Gen 9 The game literally hates players hoping to find it and i had to import one from my Gen 8 save file I have two in Gen 9 now Im glad to have one since i love that design
2024-07-24T16:16:46+0100,Yep you cant even get a photo album for potential moments when you defeated a titan pokemonstar bossgym leaders Thosezoom past you really fast and its hard to time it with the switch screenshot button
2024-07-29T04:21:59+0100,Thats why you have to read the books in the library and the notes in the labs
2024-07-31T04:25:55+0100,i honestly randomly stumbled upon a dusk form lycanroc in north province area one first time i entered it
2024-07-31T12:14:45+0100,The shiny locks on the Snackworth Legendaries Aside from getting both of the scrolls for evolving Kubfu rather than limited to one tower per profile in SwSh and an easier mean to get extra Glastier and Spectrier there isnt much motivation to go out seeking all of them
2024-07-31T13:46:07+0100,How did that even happen Finding this pokemon directly in the wild is like a 1 chance spawn but it is still practically unheard ofNot even Gen 8 Raids or Dynamax Adventures or any online Scarlet Violet battles have ever had a Dusk form as a boss
2024-07-31T14:44:56+0100,funny you mention that tooi encountered a dragon tera type dusk mane lycancroc as well offlinealthough I have never seen a Palafin Family of 3 Maushold or a shiny tera raid
2024-07-31T15:27:13+0100,Its not entirely crazy The first Sinistea I encountered in SwSh ended up being the antique form Sometimes luck finds us at the right wrong times
2024-07-31T17:34:14+0100,I never bothered about the tea bottles A pokemon is just a pokemon Probably rarest thing i found on a recent console would be the shiny Shinx i found in the first realm you unlock This was on the hills close to where Alpha Snorlax It was less than 4 days after i bought it in real time
2024-08-02T06:09:28+0100,Theres a kleavor in the terrarium but we cant evolve scyther into kleavor Okay
2024-08-02T19:49:06+0100,I guess Black Augurite is extremely rare or hard to find in Scarlet and Violet Thats the only logical answer I have
2024-08-02T20:16:35+0100,That would be fair to say but the area where Kleavor spawns in the Terarium is covered in spiky black rocks that are very clearly supposed to be Black Augurite They definitely shouldve made it available it wouldve been fine as either a Pokedex reward or something you can buy from the School Store like Archaludons Metal Alloy
2024-08-14T18:58:19+0100,Sadly it wont happen Players will have to breed themselves in scyther from another game and train it stats before sending it into Hisui to get specific stats on Kleavor if you want to train it from low levels I havent tested if the fixed spots Kleavor in paldea always has the same natures or stats spread hes not on my watch list
2024-08-14T23:45:19+0100,I did something similar to this When PLA came out I went and caught a Scyther in the Gen III Kanto Safari Zone and proceeded to get as many ribbons from there all the way to Gen VIII and made sure to get the SwSh and BDSP ribbons before transferring into PLA and evolving itI did expect the Augurite to be available in SV but it seems like that was missed So except for the solitary spawn in the DLC Kleavor is locked into transfer only territory Aside from Wyrdeer I had expected all of the Hisui crossgen evolutions to be obtainable in game So that also makes UrsalunaH available by transfer only as well Annoying for players indeed
2024-08-15T00:10:36+0100,If I have to say it its the exclusion of potential egg moves most Pokemon could learn
2024-08-17T00:01:04+0100,Im stuck on a Tera Raid battle against a Copperajah whose tera type happens to be fighting Its a 5star battle and the moves I have seen it use include Heavy Slam Curse Iron Defense and Sandstorm And yet no matter how many times I try to go up against it it keeps winning with all the help I get It doesnt help that everyone who joins me always seems to use a FAIRYTYPE Its like these people ignore type advantages and just go for flashy moves and not think smartly But this isnt the only time something like this has happened Every time I try to get help from others to win a five to sixstar rated tera raid battle people always use pokemon with a type DISadvantage against the pokemon Im up against What is wrong with people
2024-09-03T19:02:24+0100,Not necessarily the fault of the developers but Im so tired of getting into Raids where people just want to show off random shinies who are not strong and are not of proper typing to take on the raid I think some of these are those advertisements bots but I swear its not just them This is really annoyingThe character customization I liked that we get to customize the face but then all of the rest of it is so lacking in comparison to recent generations XY SM and SwSh On top of that I just feel like everyone looks the same Even for us girls we all look the same as the boys because everyone has the same body types and there are no actual long hairstyles GF really dropped the ball hereSlow interface and animations Why is it that stat changes are still a thing that we have to have to pause and watch a full animation and text box for Why cant they just be a little ping on the side of the screen instead This is particularly annoying in Raids which are already so slow with all of the other strange stuff that happen in them This isnt 1996 anymore GameFreakUnobtainable Pokemon It is a thing in all modern Pokemon games now and I will complain about it with each one aside from Legends Arceus which has actual reasoning for it
2024-09-08T18:14:23+0100,They should add a way to kick people out of the pre raid menu because sometimes they spend all their time scrolling through their boxes just to leave
2024-09-15T18:30:53+0100,When the high level Tera raid bosses too often get scripted effect that resets your hard earned boosts during the fightTera Raid Bosses that arent taking damage from obvious weakness like tera dark taking way too low damage from a fighting type pokemonInstead you need odd strategies that you would probably never guess like using a Bug Tera Mew with bug moves against 7 Star event Mewtwo and even then it is a 80 chance that you would lose andwerent allowed to catch himif i remember correctly
2023-01-17T11:06:55-0500,Pokmon Scarlet and Pokmon Violet have been released on the Nintendo Switch for two months as of tomorrow January 18th and now that the new generation has had some time to settle I figured it would be a fun way to start posting in OI again than to talk about something everyone on the Internet loves to hate other peoples opinions Had I thought of this thread idea back in 2020 I would have considered posting a similar thread for Pokmon Sword Shield also but I guess it just didnt come to me until nowIn any case the premise of this thread should be pretty simple With every new generation comes popular opinions about them and with popular opinions being a thing the opposite is bound to be true as well Ideally this can be a space where we can discuss the latter whether those opinions be positive or negative feedback Its good to be back and happy postingIll start with an opinion of my own just to get some form of discussion going I genuinely think Tinkaton might be one of the most overrated Pokmon weve had in quite some time For a Pokmon with one of the best type combinations its battle performances honestly isnt that great and its Corviknight lore so to speak feels like little more than a reason for Game Freak to give it an incredibly lazy Shiny form since its only actually the hammer that changes
2023-01-17T14:26:30-0500,Nemona kind of sucks as a rival and I was surprised to see so much praise for her Shes just sooo generic For most of the game all she really does is talk about battling andor Geeta The likes of Hop at least had his relationship with Leon and eventual switch to researchI think the way they handled the open world kind of hurt her She never really interacts with anyone bar the player and Geeta until the end of the game and by then its mostly just background stuff in Area Zero
2023-01-17T15:21:05-0500,Oh I like these type of thread I can state things I consider true without being massively flamed AnywayI actually rly like dudunsparce Sure kinda anticlimactic all things considered But it managed to preserve all the things that I liked about dunsparce while also granting them better stats and stab boomburst Also and this isnt an opinion its just a fact dudunsparce has much more changes than just one or two more body segmentsThey also gain an extra pupil one more chin spike and a weird thing at the tip of the tailI also like other unpopular mons like grafaiai scovillain and spidops tho those dont get nearly as much detractors as the earth snakeThis may sound weird but I actually wasnt as bothered by the bugs as other people I mean they were certainly there and were kinda hard to ignore ButIdk really Maybe my childhood of watching movies on damaged cds made me overtly tolerant to sudden frame drops and stuff like that Oh well All in all Im happy that my brain wasnt bothered by that it certainly helped me enjoy the game itself more
2023-01-17T15:46:30-0500,The group dynamic between Arven Penny and Nemona is I feel somewhat overrated Ive seen a few posts around the web saying theyre what Hop Bede and Marniehave been but like in the grand scheme of Scarlet Violet your three rivals barely even interact with each other outside of the final mission I think people are mistaking them being strong individual characters that end up paired together as them having a strong group dynamic But really Penny and Nemona hardly even have a reason to be involved in the final storyline Im not going to fault Hop Bede and Marnie for never being shoehorned into a scene with one another just to exchange some snarky remarks about each otherActually expanding on that I feel like the writing for The Way Home is maybe some of the weakest in the game At least up until the very end The stuff with the AI professor and their relationship to Arven thats all good But when youre adventuring through Area Zero why do Arven and Nemonas IQs take a plunge How did Arven manage to confuse research stations for radish rations Why is Nemona like 10x ditzier than she ever was during the rest of the game Penny at least gets to be sarcastic about the whole affair but that running commentary is all she contributes besides turning on a lightswitch we really needed a STEM track hacker genius to handle thatI dont really follow your logic here Tinkatons hammer isnt made of Corviknight metal its made of metal from stuff like Pawniard and Bisharp see Tinkatuffs Scarlet Pokdex entry And in any case Shiny Tinkatons hammer is bronze which doesnt correspond to the Shiny colorations of Pawniard BisharpCorviknight so I doubt they had any kind of lore in mind when determining that
2023-01-17T15:58:41-0500,I liked their dynamic and I thought Nemona was still in line with the rest of her characterization but I agree Pennys contribution to The Way Home is so weird just being turning on the lights The entire reason shes brought on at all is because of the worries about the security systems but every single security system is handled by the AI even the more dangerous or beat up onesWonder if there was some rewrites there at some point
2023-01-17T16:11:38-0500,Well to be fair it still is logic in the sense its not that they would know beforehand that the AI would handle it so her presence there was a necessity
2023-01-17T16:20:28-0500,Im not a fan of open world Pokemon done this way It worked for Legends Arceus and I liked SwShs Wild Area and DLC places but theres something about SV I dont like Its just so uninteresting Too few landmarks for a map too big and it feels like its flat or mountainous with little in between The main exception is the field between the Grass and Electric Gyms but theres nothing there Going from Mesagoza you either go west to a different colored flat area or east to a different color mountainous area that I have to admit is more interesting but is annoying to navigate as the north east mountain areas There are some really nice areas like the cliff bridge leading to the Psychic Gym the Forest where the Poison Team Star Base is and even the area with all the lakes before Mesagoza but I just dont like most of SVs open world Maybe theres some other stuff I cant put my finger on too Im pretty sure the next thing I want to complain about is a major thing tooNot sure how unpopular this is but Shiny Pokemon areWAYto common in SV and makes even looking around at whenever Pokemon spawn when Im running around for Terastal Dens almost feel like Shiny Hunting They were already too common is Legends Arceus but SV makes it even worse by letting Pokemon despawn so easily to let new ones spawn They shouldve changed the odds back to 1 in 8192 for wild Pokemon or this may be a veryunpopular opinion but maybe even decreased the odds to 1 in 16384I dont see how Shinys Tinkatons Bronze is anything like Shiny Corviknights color but I completely see not liking Tinkatons Shiny for just changing what its holding Its still better than Shinies you cant tell like Paladian Tauros Why did they think a Black Shiny for a Black Pokemon was a good idea in a game with overworld Shinies At least it looks better than KomalaThis is probably because you cant make changes to make lots of people happy withoug making some others unhappy and Im in the minority but I think I liked SwSh better Not being able to hunt for a Ditto for breeding as easily as even PreDLC SwSh and not having a Battle Facility would probably be enough to make me feel that way because theres no postgame without a Switch Online Subscription but even other in game things too like Trainers being so ignorable instead of obstacles
2023-01-17T16:28:38-0500,I dont think the past paradox mons as a group look any better than the future ones It feels like they only remembered to have a consistent design aspect in the dinosaur tail for some of them and it looks pretty stupid on some of those
2023-01-17T16:52:50-0500,Tinkatons shiny form does actually change something about the body but its very subtle All three mons in that family have metal bits sticking out of their torso that changes color to match the color of the hammer though oddly their eyes remain the same color despite being the same color as the metal in the regular formIts most noticeable with Tinkatink since its metal bit covers most of its torso
2023-01-17T17:05:06-0500,I had nausea the type of nausea I get watching my siblings play Bioshock and me and my family play Katamari games watching my nephew go through Pokemon Swords Wild Area the first time and all I can think about with the openworld direction Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are taking is that Game Freak is losing a notinconsiderable portion of their audience with nauseainducing openworld gameplay I now have to watch my nephew playing the latest Pokemon games from behind the sofa not sitting on it like he wants me to be I probably cant play openworld games for more than 20 minutes at a time without nausea unless I use handheld mode on the Switch or only play games behind the sofa and probably getting drinks or bathroom breaks every 15 minutes or soRegardless of how close its design and the Naclstack lines especially Naclstack is to copyright infringement I actually think Gholdengos design is kinda cuteThe postrelease marketing for Natdex 9991000 is getting a little too on the nose though I get how Gimmighoul takes most of a playthrough to evolve but do the official Pokemon websites and videos have to emphasize the line and their positioning at the 1grand markmuch The official websites SV Trainers Guide mentioning this line abnormally often compared to other lines with weird evolutions is pushing me over the edge and this line is already probably my favourite lorewise in all of Gen 9Say what you want about all the future Paradoxes names beginning with Iron and all of those Paradoxes looking like robotic versions of their counterparts their official art all having cool white dot effects on body parts is anice touchI do not get how Maschiff evolves facially into Mabosstiff At all The other 2 dog lines make sense this one does not Its like they switched dog breeds in the middle for the please stay mastiffs lineI do like how its implied that Mabosstiff has given up completely when it comes to making children treat it seriously thoughCompared to the worrying levels of flamboyance in descriptions of Lechonk2s and the PinkHammer lines in prerelease leaks I like and appreciate how restrained Oinkologne and the Tinkaton lines designs turned out to be Tinkaton isa loli shes a teenager at oldest and she has a squaretoothed dwarftroll face to bootRoaring Moon on the other hand deserves all the roaring praise it got on its initial leak through gameplay Really cool design and MegaMence shoutout Game Freak did not hold back there and I appreciate that tooThis might be my habit of tracking Magic the Gathering set previews leaking in and most of the average MTG set consisting of bad cards by design but I prefer judging generations by peak design instead of average design And as floozy as several lines of birds and uncreative as 3 lines of 2stage dogs are well ignore the 3 lines of 2stage insectsarachnids because those arthropodsthat diverse IRL and as obviously derivative as every single Paradoxcategory Pokemon is Gen 9 has some of the zaniest Pokemon designs in years Honestly I think theyre at least as zany as Gen 7 if not more And that zany creativity is really nice to see
2023-01-17T17:13:44-0500,Scarlet and Violets open world isnt actually a good open worldFor one it only gives you the illusion of choice Yeah after the two hour tutorial you can do whatever you want but people tend to overlook there are like 17 tiny asterisks next to it Youre still going to be forced into progressing in a specific way because if you dont you cant swim or climb or glide and catching Pokemon soon becomes a pain in the ass But even the former can mostly be circumvented in clever ways The latter is all messed up because catch rates and obedience are tied exclusively to the gym badges where instead they should have been tied tooverall progressionTheres no sense of danger and barely any sense of discovery The most memorable open worlds are ones where the world itself feels dangerous and where through multiple playthroughs youll still discover something you havent in the previous ones Whats the point of high level areas where you can simply walk past them like any other area And all youre really doing in the overworld is scavenging items and collecting Pokemon wheres the sidequestsAnd then the three arcs dont even tie into the overworld all that much Team Star feels like the most neglected and wasted potential You have this whole group thats supposed to interrupt the whole quest in the first place but then they pretty much stay in their corner Plus all they unlock is just some TMs in which you can get most of them through the overworld in the first place Team Star should have done what Team Yell was doing in Sword and Shield and hinder your progress until you beat the snot out of them It would have made them feel moreThe Pokemon League a concept thats been around since the very beginning is downsized in its importance so it wouldnt outstage the finale I wouldnt be surprised if Game Freak outright removed the League and didnt replace it with an equivalent in Gen 10 because they seem to be doing this often Just look what happened to having all the Pokemon playable in one game and the Battle TowerArvens quest does manage to tie into the overworld because his arc doesnt even end at the completion of the questAnd then the actual layout in itself Its just geometrical shapes slapped onto each other that make traveling it pretty cumbersome There are actual 90degree turns and stuff within the mapIn many ways Scarlet and Violet is like the Sonic Frontiers of Pokemon games They both made a change to the formula after a controversial previous entry Both stories are held in a positive light because of the previous entrys story and characterization They both have some great highs maybe even some of the best in the series but also some egregiously disgusting lows that neither IP should be making when considering how old each franchise is
2023-01-17T17:28:10-0500,This game overall feels more like an elaborate tech demo or proofofconcept than an actual complete experience Complaining about TPCs crunch culture and lack of polish is nothing new or unpopular but frankly I think this game is little more than an unpolished template and feels horribly incomplete as an actual 60dollar AAA gameDo I want Pokmon games in the future to expand upon and improve from this template Yes 100 I do But I dont think these games will stand the test of time at all which is a shame because with just a bit more time to marinate say a 2023 release to better Soave it out from PLA it could have been something truly special Im glad that people found the game fun and I do to an extent but my frustration with it feeling blatantly incomplete outweighs that
2023-01-17T19:42:20-0500,I like the new egg system of idle hatching I know some folks are frustrated with the fact you cant hatch and get eggs at the same time which is fair but I still like the idle for eggs bit a lot I feel like Im wasting way less time going for shiny Pokmon when Im working on something else with Pokmon going in the BGJubilife Village should have been in SV and the big school should have been in PLA What I mean by that is that the game with segmented levels should have had a nice cool central hub I can explore in between visits to places while SV should have had a mostly tame little town you dont feel bad about not visiting a lot Ive still spent basically no time in the school I dont actually remember its name I want to drive around the open world not sit in some laggy city
2023-01-17T20:43:39-0500,Starfall Street is the best of the three storylines or at least a strong contender The gameplay is bad except the sheer hype of the squad boss fights but thats not what Im here to defendMost criticisms Ive seen of the story boil it down to just bullying bad but theres a lot more to it than that In fact I dont think it says much at all about howwhy bullying is bad it kind of just reasonably assumes that well accept that and focuses on other themes The word bullying is said often but there isnt a lot more in there about bullying itselfMeanwhile Starfall Street gives youVarious kinds of loveable misfits perhaps relatable to anyone who struggledstruggles at all to fit in as a kid I doubt I was half as weird as Atticus and I find him kind of relatable anywayThose misfits rallying together in the face of adversity and supporting each other in a really wholesome and endearing wayA group that seems abrasive at face value but then flips that perception on its head pretty much as soon as you beat any bossAt the same time a group that stood up for a righteous cause but ended up taking things too far and needed to be confronted about the path it was onAnd my favourite of all An authority figure who goes out of his way to understand the abrasiveseeming outcast group and ends up properly apologizing for the ways his institution failed them Its kind of weird how Clavell an extremely important character in this story seems to seldom even be mentioned by its haters Also Pokemon is partly a childrens game the SV stories all deal heavily in childrens story themes and I think the example of a respectful authority figure that Clavell sets is excellent for the kidsThrow in an okay gag with the Clive stuff a reasonably fun character in Penny and an identity twist thats obvious to adults but might plausibly fool some kids and youve got a solid story hereIts fine not to like Starfall Street this post is just sharing my opinion but this is one of those moments where a lot of the vocal critics dont seem to have even understood it
2023-01-18T13:28:49-0500,Team Star is a bunch of weirdos that deserved to get picked on
2023-01-19T18:34:09-0500,By the end of the game Nemona had cemented herself as my most disliked major character in franchise history I skipped gens 6 through 8 so Im sure that Ive missed some other clunkers but out of the games that Ive played I cant remember a single other character who left a strong enough negative impression to actually bother me This is partly because of how shes written but also part of my biggest problem with the adventure as a whole this game doesnt have a real antagonist Not until the final boss anyway which is mostly out of left field and not really built up toI dont care for the Team Star plot and think that its pretty lame on the whole but Ill at least score that one as a matter of taste and preference Theres at least a novelty to a nonvillainous villainous group so I can live with it even if I dont really like it But even taking that into account Team Star suffers further from the way the open world is set up the three major questlines are treated as entirely separate things and not one of them ever really has any bearing on either of the others In past games youd have the villainous team get in your way in some manner or another as part of your main quest diverting your attention and establishing them as a threat that needs to be defeated That cant really happen here with how SV is set up You can and I did ignore Team Star entirely until the other two quests are completed So not only are the stakes lower than theyve ever been in the series for a villainous team the way that theyre implemented here ensures that they have the least possible impact on the world around them They hardly matterArvens plotline ended up being my favorite of the three but even then I expected more out of it than what I got Like at first I thought okay this guy is using me for his own ends and is probably going to doublecross me at some point for one reason or another Or barring that his plan of reviving Mabosstiff is going to backfire on him and Ill end up having to battle Mabosstiff as the final Titan or something Neither happened there wasnt any twist at all And you know what Im okay with that too On some level its actually refreshing to have a somewhat competent supporting character whoneed me to completely bail them out in the end Way to pull your weight ArvenAnd that leaves Nemona the socalled champion whodespite being a supercompetitive battle geniusnever actually tries to defeat you and never once even expresses any disappointment for losing Thats an awful spot to be in for a rival character I dont need every rival to be a GBera jerk but I expect them to at least Nemona doesnt All shes good for is some of the most patronizing interactions Ive ever seen in a video game in the same encounter going back and forth between taking it easy on you with a weak team because youre a greenhorn and showering praise and astonishment on you for being a genius who knows how to utilize type advantages Its borderline insultingWith BDSP fairly fresh in my mind I think back to Barry for contrast He wasnt a scumbag out to make your life miserable like Blue was But he very much felt like he had his own goals to achieve for himself and wasquite literallyone step ahead of you throughout the adventure He plainly demonstrated as much through his actions Until he loses to Team Galactic 75 the way into the story that is and you switch places with him from that point onward being one step ahead of him for the rest of the way instead Thats a really basic but nevertheless effective way of conveying progress for the player characterSV doesnt have anything like that It doesnt feel like theres a single major character in the quest who is serving as a barrier for you to overcome It feels like the player character is never really given an opportunity to grow Its kind of a problem for all three questlines but it feels most pronounced for Nemona because out of any of them youd expect the rival to carry the load of being the designated obstacleIve said this elsewhere and got lol way to overthink a kids game lol in response and okay sure But every single Pokemon game is built for barelyliterate children and every other one that I played managed to have at least one antagonist
2023-01-19T23:41:44-0500,Look I love Nemona but I will say thisThere is NOTHING wrong with wanting to think a lot about kids media man I hate that condescending termI like kids media because it does so much of a better job sneaking mature themes in rather than the obviously adult media going LOOK HOW DARK AND EDGY WE ARE see HBO Maxs VelmaKids media doesnt have to be exclusively for kids It can be for everyone it just takes the right execution and screw people who think otherwise Im 25 and I still enjoy several kidrelated franchises and shows and movies Pixar is perhaps the shining example of this philosophy
2023-01-20T03:32:04-0500,Making it so the only buildings you can enter in the game are the school the gym lobbies the sandwich store and that restaraunt where you fight Larry makes this open world feel tiny and closed off Especially since most of them are tiny little square rooms Was it really that necessary to appease people who would joke about player characters barging into strangers houses in RPGs to make the world feel so barren
2023-01-20T03:42:50-0500,The benefit of this is that the game barely has any loadingtransition screens or guardhouses littered all over the map that do nothing but connect the actually functional areas Thats worth something and its a notable QoL perk in a game thats otherwise full of performance issuesBut it does make the world feel pretty empty at times Like there ought to be at least one notable and unique building per city to explore Or actual dungeons for the titan andor legendary pokemon
2023-01-20T17:34:40-0500,I hate the new designs of the human characters in this gamethe player characters for an anime aesthetic theyre coded as ugly
2023-01-21T14:25:41-0500,Disclaimer I have no idea if any of these opinions are actually unpopular But here goesI think the Sprigatito line is amazing in every possible way and Meowscarada is one of my alltime favorite final stage starters Im very happy that Sprigatito stood up because it wouldnt have been nearly as awesome if it had stayed quadrupedThe Fuecoco line is my least favorite starter line from ScaVio I dont dislike it but I just never saw the appeal in Fuecoco Crocalor did not really improve upon it Skeledirge on the other hand is the best member of the line but at the same time it feels very off compared to the preevolutions I usually like when Pokmon evolutions take an unexpected twist but here it bothers me I think I would have liked it better if the preevolutions had looked more similar to SkeledirgeFrom what I have seen it seems like several fans were disappointed by Quaquaval but I think it is fine Not my favorite Water starter but definitely my second favorite Paldea starterI think the only real negative about the new Pokmon on the whole are the low number of new regional formsevolutionsBeing unable to enter most buildings wasnt as bad as I thought since it makes things a lot more convenient while shoppingI think the Lets Go feature outclasses the following Pokmon feature in every possible way since it actuallysomething and it feels a lot more immersive than just having your Pokmon following behind you like a slaveThe bad performance of the game didnt bother me all too much I still consider it a negative since my game crashed once but even so I can live with itHowever one thing I consider to be a big negative is how battle animations cant be turned off I think thats my second biggest issue with the games the first one is obviously dexitNemona is a great rival While not my favorite overall she is still fantastic and Ill take her over Blue and Silver any day those are the two most overrated rivals ever if you ask meI think ScaVio are great games but I think they are actually about equal to SS which I am also a big fan of Though I think both are way better than LA With that said I do prefer the way LA handled the region design by having a linear open world as opposed to a full open worldTinkaton is the best Pokmon everOkay thats definitely not unpopular
2023-01-22T03:22:23-0500,I feel like poor pacing via presentation battle animations of menusprompts etc is an evergreen problem with the series Some aspects improve or regress over time but in general it always sticks out to me Like I can still remember how glacial DPs pace was and how much Pt tightened it up within the same genIts wild to me that trainertotrainer trades and box releases are still 1 Pokemon at a time Compare it with how much has changed granularly over the decades for the many aspects of raising competitive pokemon Trades arent any speedier than they were on the Game Boy
2023-01-22T11:50:00-0500,They clearly like making trades an event and probably do not care that people might want to trade multiple things in a short period of time Now you would think with how Surprise Trades work encourage you to keep the train going that they would make this a lot more instant or at least have a faster variant butno No they sure didnt huhMass box release meanwhile Youll note that Lets Go Legends Arceus both have it but I guarantee the logic is these aregames youre capturing things all the time for resources but the normal games arent that qed theres no reason to have it because most people arent capturing or filling in a million boxesIn the former just about everyone is capturing a ton of Pokemon In the latter very few people are doing intensive breeding or shiny hunting through eggs for a finizen my boxes are so fullnot to mention those hunts I did 3fam Maushold and 3segment Dudunsparces so they just do not see it as a thing that would be in there
2023-01-25T21:09:52-0500,For Regional Forms and Regional Evolutions thats understandable Several more regional forms wouldnt hurt anyoneFor new traditional evolutions I dont think weany more of those this badly since both it and LA just brought back traditional evolutions as concept for new Pokmon despite some caveats on the latters Pokmon At the same tine few more wouldnt be a bad thingAs for the thread Did anyone else thought we didnt explored enough of Geetas questionable decisions in action
2023-01-25T21:28:12-0500,I kind of floated it elsewhere in the story thread I think that we might get something more with Geeta perhaps the other characters in general in DLCEven ignoring the strangeness with Glimmora and that random errand she put Nemona on but didnt follow up with itd be a little odd though also very interesting for a Champion for the last impression of Geeta being shes a boss that everyone who works under her hates or is unnerved by
2023-01-26T15:20:31-0500,Thought Id voice my opinion on what I think Game Freaks mindset was going into this From their perspective the Paradox Pokmon must have felt like a sort of replacement of more traditional regional variants that also happens to fit better with the whole past and future theme of this game I get that with the existence of Paldean Wooper Clodsire and Paldean Tauros this argument only has so much to back it up but at the end of the day cant one still make the argument that say Iron Bundle for example is really just Paldean Delibird with a fresh Metal Coat of paintAlso just in case this comes up Brute Bonnet could still be a Paldean Amoonguss even though the base variant can still show up in Paldea I view these instances in a similar manner to how you can get a Kantonian Raichu or Marowak in the Alola games if you evolve a Pikachu or Cubone in Ultra Space respectively Exeggcute also works for this but unlike the other two I cant actually remember where to find a wild Exeggcute in the Alola games off the top of my head
2023-01-27T09:21:30-0500,One major difference to point out is the BST of the Paradox Pokmon often 570 BST and in the case of Roaring Moon and Iron Valiant 590 BST I can see where are you getting at with them being essentially Paldean variants in all but name and BSTI wonder if there are more Paradox Pokmon planned for DLC in addition to the Imaginated ones Scarlet Suicune and Violet Virizion
2023-02-02T23:51:47-0500,The answer is unsurprisingly Exeggutor Island also some other parts of Poni Island but only in the original SunMoon
2023-02-03T12:15:33-0500,I had a feeling this was the case but not only has it been so long since Ive played an Alola game for reals but I was also thinking about Exeggutor Island being a lategame location as such meaning the wild Pokmon would more likely be evolved
2023-03-02T17:32:15-0500,I wanted Sprigatito to stand on both legs when it evolves from the start just to tick others off
2023-03-03T11:24:50-0500,See the part that bothers me is going Quadruped to Bipedal If Sprigatito had stood one 2 legs from the outset I dont think nearly as many people would give a shit
2023-03-03T21:20:45-0500,Meh people still whinging about bipedalquadrupedal stuff annoys me Its been a thing amongst starters since Gen 2 excluding Gen 4 and it happens in other evo lines and people dont give a crap
2023-03-03T23:28:32-0500,Its more about bipedalhumanoidGen I All starters keep the same stance all remain similarly bestialGen II Cyndaquilshifts stance all remain similarly bestialGen III Mudkipshifts stance Blaziken becomes more humanoidGen IV Chimcharshifts stance all remain similarly bestialGen V Serperior loses limbs Samurott becomes quadripedal Emboar becomes bipedal Emboar becomes more humanoid Samurott becomes more bestialthis is where the problem startsGen VI Delphox becomes bipedal Delphox becomes more humanoidGen VII Incineroar becomes bipedal All 3 become more humanoidGen VIII Inteleon becomes bipedal All 3 become more humanoidGen IX Meoscarada becomes bipedal Meoscarada becomes more humanoidNow this is obviously subjective But there was a shift around Gen VI to having the starters be more humanoid have more distinct personalities built in and be bipedal People who object to one part of that are possibly objecting to all of it just not being specificHumorously I dont object to bipedal but I do very specifically object to humanoid Fenniken and Sprigatito are adorable and their evos are awful
2023-03-03T23:48:38-0500,I actually quite like Floragato It looks cool and its coolness is enhanced by a rose broach that doubles as a yoyoMeowscarada has fucky eyes and a strut I do not like it
2023-03-04T01:39:04-0500,100 agree with this The humanoid proportions poses and distinctive personality traits make them feel too much like people instead of just intelligent animals Even Pokemon that are abstractly based on humans in the past have not had as many distinctly human psychological traits ie a Conkeldurr or Gothitelle does not feel like a person as much as Meowscarada Cinderace is just straight up a guy in a soccer uniform Meowscarada could easily be some spellcaster character in another work of fiction It feels like these Pokemon are trying to more like individual characters than a species which I dont likeIts not even just starters either theres also Tinkaton Palafin and Maushold which do this Even Mimikyu a Pokemon I like does this its basically designed as the character youre supposed to feel sorry for though it doesnt seem as human as the others due to design and having personality traits which are less specifically human Theres more cases of this these are just the best examples off the top of my head Id argue that Charcadet and Salazzle fall under this but I decided to focus on clearer points firstCynically I feel like this trend is part of larger trends in marketing There are a number of Pokemon seemingly designed to replicate the success of previously popular Pokemon Cinderace taking traits from Incineroar and Greninja Fidough playing a similar marketing role to Yamper The influx of storytelling Pokemon which act more human seems like an attempt to replicate the specialness of LegendaryMythical Pokemon many of which also take more of a storytelling role and may actually specific individuals rather than an entire species particularly the movie Mythicals It doesnt seem like a coincidence given the increasing legendary spam over the generations
2023-03-04T12:33:25-0500,Personally I ended up liking Meowscarada the best out of the three fully evolved forms I agree it might have been a nice design if Meowscarada had more or less kept its look but was quadrupedal looking a bit more like a Sphinx or something I dont mind that it standsWhile I appreciate that Quaxquaval wasnt just water Blaziken I think the chicken bottom humanoid top ends up looking worse than pure humanoidFor Skeledirge I just cannot get over how its white head and mouth fire makes it look like a balding clown It really ruins the design for me Not a clowns are scary thing I just think it looks super ugly
2023-03-04T13:07:46-0500,Correct me if Im wrong but wasnt the whole starters all eventually become humanoidish a trend because it makes them more humanlike duh thus easier to get attached to for the kids thus in turn making mechandise selling easier
2023-03-04T13:14:56-0500,I feel like this is something Ive heard a bunch but never had an interview attached to it
2023-03-04T13:22:06-0500,Meowscarada is fine as is and I dont want its design to be changed Definitely my favorite of the 3 starters since it was first revealed and think its a marketed improvement over Delphox and Incineroar It really nails the trickster theme its going for gameplaywise too learning all the sneaky moves like UTurn Knock Off and Trick by level up Also feels a bit more fun to use than ingame compared Cinderace despite its comparatively worse statline due to learning more physical moves by level up egg move transfering letting it get its good egg moves easily My one complaint about it is that its hidden ability is by far the worst of the three Protean only has use of Choice sets which is fine but a bit limiting Losing its amazing STAB combo on other sets makes it feel like a liability especially since its STAB combo is all it needs most of the time I wish its signature ability was something more practically useful like Hustle Sniper or Magic GuardViolet Paradoxes are cool I like their chrome textures esp on the shiny forms and the futuristic neon energy lights most of them have are a nice touch too The only thing I dislike about them are some gameplay related things ie movepool oddities like Iron Jugulis not getting Nasty Plot
2023-03-04T13:23:10-0500,Yuck I hate both Incineroar and Primarina Too similar to Emboar for one and shoved down my throat for SmashSounds about right
2023-03-20T02:04:37-0400,So I watched my nephew play Pokemon Violet for the second straight Sunday this evening Day 1 actually wasnt too bad Today convinced me that Pokemon Violets openworld implementation was even worse than I fearedeven though I looked away from the TV about every 5 minutes and I was always behind the sofa Game Freak has my sisters money but it wont have mine until they stop making openworld gamesI remain convinced that Game Freak is losing a noticeable amount of their otherwise paying audience making nauseainducing openworld gamesOn another note the worst part of the Pokemon Violet viewing experience tonight wasnt the jerky legs and walking and it wasnt the disappearing Miraidon or Pokeball thrower It wasnt even the lag after my nephew plunges Miraidon into a water area yet again before it learns how to swimIt was the camera occasionally dropping to the ground and zooming in on the player character and pointing skywardThis leads to some lessthanintuitive experiences trying to control the player character at least IMO and probably helped make me motion sick watching Pokemon Violet onandoff tonight
2023-03-20T02:57:06-0400,I personally havent had this issue in 120 hours or havent noticed it I doubt GF is losing much either since I havent seen this mentioned at all anywhere else and a huge portion of sales come prior to any reviews being posted
2023-03-20T03:53:53-0400,I suspect Im one of the unlucky 5 who get dizzy and motion sick playing or watching certain video games but even that percentage has to be a noticeable audienceAs for the camera issue my nephew triggered that multiple times tonight and a week ago each I only noticed the disappearing Miraidon and the disappearing Pokeballthrowing trainer whose Pokeball amusingly did not disappear tonight and once each
2023-03-20T07:52:00-0400,There are other reasons to dislike openworld games besides nausea In my case interest in exploring 90 of the environment is not enough to be worth the tradeoffs made to the difficulty curve and the other 10 of the environment is the only area thats closed off Though unfortunately for both of us it probably isnt a net loss for GF even though it is a loss
2023-03-20T08:06:23-0400,I would point that not specifically linked to your issue with visual sickness when a franchise does a change in direction in this case moving from linear to open world its guaranteed that a certain chunk of the playerbase may get discouraged or stop playingbuying altogether due to not liking the new systemWhat the companies usually bank on is that the new players you will attract will outweight the ones you loseUltimately expecially in modern era you cant please everyone
2023-03-20T08:15:50-0400,The Sun Moon anime series does have a Mimikyu whos rottentothecore that resent the Pikachu species popularity which is noted as a large contrast to other members of its species GF should not make the species feeling onenote in terms of potential personality between each species otherwise it makes them too rigid for fanmade contents by making fans complacent about the species socalled behaviorsMeanwhile Im having mixed feelings about this generations power creepOne one hand GF really took one step forward two step backward considering an attempt of rebalancing Zacian Zamazentas nerf isnt so bad since it did get Body Press wouldnt care about Intimidate as much as the sword counterpart would making sure Terastalization isnt overwhelming like Dynamax and succeeded for the most part and making Protean a lot less oppressive but then we have even more overpowered moves and Pokmon within a single generation to the point where plenty of Paldeaintroduced nonLegendary Pokmon got either quickbanned or suspect banned within few months after Scarlet Violet release making their balancing act not sincere at allBut on the other hand barring a few stinkers they did succeeded at making many of the newcomers useful for ingame and competitive so its nice to see many new faces in Singles OU and Doubles OU as well as VGC It helps that most signature move and or Ability were actually useful and gel well with the Pokmons toolkit even it ended up working too well in a few casesTruth is the power creep in earlier generations arent that bad and it were the PseudoLegends Legendary Mythical and other restricted Pokmon to put the blame for it since those from later generations were oftentimes blatantly better than what came before While Gen 5 and when considering Mega Evolution Gen 6 were arguable exceptions it wasnt until Generation 9 that things went into an overdrive Though Gen 8 can be considered as a harbringer
2023-03-20T09:08:52-0400,As a singles player myself this seems a bit harsh on the balancing Given they tend to balance the game around Doubles as the format theyre trying to make an eSport out of the Generation has had some banworthy mons but I also think Singles has gained a decent number of influentialbutnotstupid Pokemon like Skeledirge and Meowscarada Roaring Moon Iron Valiant and of course Great TuskOf the Tiering Actions that have happened so far several of them are Pokemon that definitely are only busted in a 6v6 Singles context Last Resorts having more faints for power ChienPao and ChiYu Cyclizar for Shed Tail spam for example Terastalization got looked at but so far is considered balanced and Espathra legitimately feels like an accident in that regard as a onemon Baton Pass chain Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle seem like the only ones that stick out so far as massive misteps since they seem to have VGC viability on top of MinMaxed Singles playI wouldnt call the effort perfect but I cant call the balancing act insincere just based on this every Gens had some stand out players especially if we include the big players like Pseudos or Megas Garchomp in Gen 4 a lot of Weather Abusers in Gen 5 several Gen 6 Megas UBs like Pheromosa and Naganadel in Gen 7 etc
2023-03-20T21:40:45-0400,The difficulty curve isnt that hard to fix GF justdidnt Now Pokemon would find it harder than something like Skyrim or Dark Souls where player skill and build are much more important than raw stats A lvl 1 run of Skyrim which beats every boss is perfectly plausible In Pokemon if youre lvl 30 walking into a lvl 40 boss fight good luck So I get that fixing the difficulty would take a delicate touch But theres several ways GF could have handled each boss fight gets harder as you progress you are expected to levelup to compensate that wouldnt have been weve randomly scattered the various bosses around the map each of them has a set level and theres no ingame indication which is the nextmostpowerful
2023-03-23T15:15:40-0400,To be honest I was thinking if the real question is what the actual intend about the difficulty curve wasWhile our expectation was that trials can be beaten in any orderm theres a part of me that believes that the actual intent was to create scenarios where the player attempts a gym or trainer or story beat or something and gets absolutely murdered to create the Ill come back when Im stronger scenario Incidentally what happened to me a couple timesWhich isnt too different from back when in older pokemon games as well as several other RPGs you could tecnically access higher level areas right away yet youd get destroyed by the encounters It isnt even a huge deal in Pokemon considering theres basically 0 penalty from getting defeated other than a minor money lossSkyrim is often considered how level scaling done right works but even that one is imperfect with a decent chunk of people often complaining that the system defeats the point of growing up your character if the relative difficulty of the game stays the same so the aspect of getting stronger is completely removed when youre the almighty Dragonborn vanquisher of dragons and yet even the bandits near the starting area are as strong as the ones in the rest of the world for no apparent reasonThere are also plenty of examples of gamesseries that attempted level scaling and it fucking sucked with I think the most glaring example being Final Fantasy 8 which is infamous for how the game actually is easier at level 1 than it is at level cap by a combination of the power you can gain from external sources Junctions magic being way higher at lower level compared to the enemy strenght You can get basically maxed stats while having lower than level 10All in all as I said at start I do wonder if they actually want you to lose Some games are designed in a way that youre meant to find out by rude awakening when you are challenging something stronger than youThough if that was the case the game really should have given some kind of better hint about the actual level of a given gymtrial
2023-03-23T15:45:53-0400,Dudunsparce is a perfect evolution Dunsparce was a dorky Pokmon and I am glad its evolution remains a dorky Pokmon He is My Son and can do no wrong
2023-03-23T16:19:01-0400,I agree that the intention was likely that the player would settle in to doing the quests in level order after being pushed back However I think that they wouldnt be able to catch players with the same setup if the levels were clearly delineated since I expect more casual players will just follow the sequence anyway Effectively I think the part that breaks the system is that the bosses are too easy You have players accidentally sequence breaking because they didnt notice they were supposed to lose which then ruins anything they skipped over because those encounters arent capable of being engaging to a higherlevel party Spreading out the bosses levels either by reducing their number or using more of the level range pokemon games dont really do anything past lvl75 might help in additon to the obvious answer of increasing the challenge
2023-03-23T16:55:49-0400,Honestly I dont think there was a good way to work this system in the way they orchestrated SVIn general I think that if my assumption is right its a design that wouldnt really work in a turn based rpg like Pokemon specifically because of what you said if you do sequence break either intentionally or accidentally suddently the rest of the game becomes a jokeA very recent game that I still consider a masterpiece despite this issue in fact two are Octopath Traveler I and II These games operate on a similar design concept you have a open map 99 of the map is open right from the start everything except chapter specific dungeons and you can tackle every of the 8 char stories in any order The locations and level of every chapter are shown clearly on the map and yet its basically inevitable that you will eventually overlevel some of them simply because by the time you finished two of the last chapters your main party is signifcantly higher level than the chapters and will often end up carrying everyone else thus making the first 23 stories you finish pretty challenging and all others usually a breezeAbsolutely great games btw 100 recommend if youre into oldschool turn based jrpgsI just dont think theres a good way to do this its a inherent flaw of leaving the player free to sequence break but also not wanting to do level scalingOverally I think Pokemon should just adopt level scaling for gyms and similar challenges have them have multiple teams and pick whichever the player level is closer to maybe with a upper cap of 6070 aka their rematch Ultimately this is canon in the anime several gym leaders do say they pick their teams based on opponents experience and basically also canon in the games since rematches exist Plus iirc the bug gym leader in SV literally complains that shes always forced to use her weak pokemon because shes often the first gym the students take due to being the closest so she has to go easy on them
2023-03-23T21:43:30-0400,Same with Nemona only being able to go all out when were done
2023-03-24T23:35:48-0400,Theres even a Tell me where to go next feature at the pokemon centers that doesnt actually point you to the next leveled boss for some reasonWays to fix the level curveLevel scale the bosses based on your badge count obviousMake it more obvious where to go nextmake the boss route more linear Basically make the route up each side of the map very clearly point you towards the next boss sequentially instead of jumping around and having large gaps on each sideInclude a few more roadblocks to keep players to lowmidhigh level areas bettereither make it impossible to sequence break or at least harder Dont have a 20 level jump from crossing an unattended bridgeSome nonbattle related badgesthis wouldnt fix anything itd just be a nice changeRework the entire fight system to not be so leveldependent not happeningProbably other stuff Im forgetting
2023-03-30T09:08:44-0400,Theres a perhaps foolish part of me that thinks that while the main stat and damage calculation is strongly tied to level its still possible to have fights that dont lean as heavily on level as the current ones by using more of the other mechanics and less direct damage FEAR is the gimmicky extreme end of this idea as long as the opponent is capable of knocking down the user to 1HP no other stats are relevant
2023-03-30T09:47:08-0400,Some games do use actual damage scaling based on levelsOne of the most recent infamous cases is SMTV where if youre significantly higher lower level than the enemy there are massive damage buffs penalties at play to the point where if youre 5 or more lvls below a enemy you basically do negligible damage yet get absolutely deleted by them It is still possible to beat bosses underleveled speedruns do that but it requires significantly more game knowledge and planning on top of luckI wouldnt exactly trust GF to make this kind of level scaling work but it is something some other games do
2023-05-06T19:32:02-0400,if one more person complains about how buggy sv is i will commit a crime of an unspecified but noninsignificant scale game freak has to pump out a new pokemon game every three years otherwise no new pokemon come out that means the anime stops the merch stops to some extent the card game stops and all sources of income for gamefreak are halted until new pokemon come out and these pokemon have to be good when people bring up gen 5 pokemon do they bring up bisharp volcarona zoruark hydreigon haxorus krookadile or any of the other cool pokemon it has to offer no they only bring up the lines of kling vanilite the monkeys and garbodor those are just 14 of the 156 new pokemon introduced in gen 5 and yet they are the ones that get all the attention and thats just the concepts they have to come up with they also have to implimant the data for all of the previous pokemon they made all in the best graphics feasable for the time this may have been fine when there were only 300 pokemon but in case you havent noticed theres a bit more than that now they have to code over 1000 pokemon in 3 years while also coming up with new concepts for pokemon people places and stories they tried to mitigate this by including only some of the pokemon but despite there being statistically 0 people who like heatmor fans were outraged that game freak were hesitant to not include over 1000 pokemon in the new games thats not the only shortcuts they tried to take to keep their buisness afloat sword and shield is a very unpopular game and yet few people try to ask why it was so bad if they want to impliment 1000 different pokemon a bunch of flashy mechanics a giant world to explore a compelling story ballenced gameplay and new creative designs thats gonna cost the weekends of the aproxamately 400 employees who worked tirelessly to make sure the game was even released on time people like to complain about the situation the games come out in but under these circumstances they were gonna complain no matter how the game came out unless it were to be delayed which is not an option if game freak wants to keep their buisness running do you have any idea how cruel the japanese coding industry already is on the workers they worked tirelessly to feed their families and you have the audacity to insult their results
2023-05-06T21:30:16-0400,I just recently got around to finishing the main story of Violet for the first time and while I havent had any major issues with the game myself there may be people that have had issues with this game andor the other Switch core series games With a multimedia franchise with as big of dreams as Pokmon trying to please everyone was not an option from the very start They have to satisfy so many people and ask if their efforts will be worth it because we all know Game Freak as a company is entirely carried by the core series Pokmon titles at this rate As for The Pokmon Company International theyre out here trying to make ends meet every three years like you said so whats the problem here if its not Pokmons faultSimply put a lot of your comments while perfectly valid such as that on the Japanese coding industry for instance are hurt significantly by the fact that other Japanese IPs dont have many of the issues that the modern Pokmon games do It speaks volumes about product quality that franchises like The Legend of Zelda Xenoblade Chronicles et cetera can run perfectly fine on the Nintendo Switch hardware when they have enough time to cook in the oven Im almost positive Pokmon fans would be more than willing to pay 60 a year for new corse series games that werent released on such a tight scheduleThe problem as I see it isnt anything Nintendo Game Freak or The Pokmon Company have done Rather this seems to be an issue of poor communication between all three and for whatever reason this has resulted in the Pokmon franchise as a whole developing an unhealthy phobia of wanting to delay their newest products until theyre up to the standard of quality consumers should expect from a 60 firstparty title In other words its not just the core series games that should be delayed The next generation of merchandising on all fronts would have to be delayed so the guys over at Game Freak can have time to play catchup
2023-05-06T22:00:32-0400,Elite 4 and Geeta was a letdownThe rivals were great though especially Nemona she was the best rival ever for the whole game But the world map sucks Its a critical part of every open world game and ScarletViolets map really aggravated meAlso the overlaid grid is just a transparent layer that does not change when you zoom in or out Its just a clunky decoration
2023-05-06T22:22:09-0400,Tbfh to be precise the people who complain about SV quality that arent just being pepegas for the sake of it are complaining of GameFreaks leaderships choice to not expand the development teams nor seeking help from other Nintendo studiosAnyone with a grain of salt knows this isnt the employees fault if anything theyre likely suffering from the poor reception on top of the amount of threats they got last generationThat doesnt remotely excuse the poor decisions of the leadershipTheyve always been notoriously bad with 3d graphics and the game development suffers greatly from it As you said this isnt 2d games anymore the small staff doesnt cut it anymoreIf they didnt own 33 of the IP chances are theyd have been all fired ages ago and TPCI would have hired a different company for the gamesAnd honestly Monolith studios are a 260ish employees company also owned by Nintendo and is capable of producing masterpieces like the Xenoblade series on the same platform GameFreaks have 170ish employees and still pretend they are able to keep up with the one game per year release cycle that Nintendo demands of themWhatever the fuck GameFreaks leadership is doing its been horribly hurting the quality of the games for a while and probably the psyche of their employees too
2023-05-06T23:34:30-0400,I feel the need to point out that while Nintendo likely bears some blame in so far as they also own a third of TPC and likely does influence developmental decisions and timelines and could likely step in and go hey were not doing this as much as they can hey were doing this it probably is far more on Gamefreak who are the ones actually developing the game the ones presenting their game plans to Nintendo for approval the ones working with Nintendo on the timelines and the ones that provide that guidance for the conglomerate of TPCs various other stuff based on what theyre doingAlso want to point out while were here that the remaining third is fucking Creatures IncLiterally a company dedicated to thisAnyway all that aside the series would easily be able to like delay things if needed Hell it already has the SV TCG set didnt start until a few months after the games came out and the anime didnt start up until April And the anime barely even needs to be about the new games at this point and the TCG certainly doesnt either And theres plenty of nonGen 9 merch lines they can put out or merch focused on ones already revealedAnd above all they can literally just go from the start of development this will be a 4 year dev cycle if they want and everything is planned around that But they dont GameFreak themselves likely feels there wasnt a problem despite all the problemsnow that they had to publically apologize for how buggy the game was maybe theyll go perhaps the next one can be longer in the oven but that likely wont help thenext game thats likely locked in
2023-05-07T08:03:20-0400,Im at the point where my interest in the current mainline games isnt enough for me to buy them so while a game might be releasing every year I sure havent been playing a new pokemon game each year Effectively a longer dev cycle that leads to a more complete experience stands toincreasethe number of new games I would be buying and playing
2023-05-07T10:00:44-0400,your asking them to stop all means of income for them just to apeal to some ungrateful crybabys that cant handle games having bugs in them even though gen 1 exists thats not happening even if game freak wanted it to happen because they are a second party developer for nintendo all the complaining about the bugs is doing is ruining some japanese programmers day
2023-05-07T11:15:03-0400,I cant believe Gen 9 delays stop the sales of their 300 Charizard ToysReal talk though this is a point for stretching the Gens out more to me I barely had time to remember or internalize most of the Gen 7 and 8 mons outside of the big Mainstay Legendaries with Anime appearances because by the time I got a feel for any of them we were on to something elseIron out the games before jumping into the next Gen both so the new games function better I love SVs design and region but the 18 FPS genuinely hurts my eyes if I play as long as I usually would a game and so that the old ones have time to make more than a superficial impact on the brand
2023-05-07T11:55:55-0400,No because they can just keep making merch of the stuff they already have until a new game is out Itll be okay I promise the entire pokemon apparatus wont spiral out of control if they have to go another year without brand new Pokemon even ignoring that if they revealed it earlier as teases they have Pokemon to make merch of anywayI will say as a minor aside the the point of I barely had time to rememberinternalize might be more of a you thing The 3year cycle has been a thing for a long time Gen 2 Gen 3 was about 3 years Gen 5 Gen 6 about 3 years Gen 6 7 about 3 7 8 about 3 tooExcusing Gen 1 2 since that whole thing is kind of a mess that involved a full reboot of what GS would even really be Gen 3 4 was the only time we had a 4 year cycle certainly but I think that its not a year per say that really stops you from internalizing it There can be all kinds of factors Not as young disinterest in the franchise orspecific game theres a ton of Pokemon now playing other things taking up your timemental space real world stuff etc etcLike personally anecdotally I have no problems interliazing these generations I know other people who likewise dont have much of an issue I also know people who never internalized anything after gen 1 or gen 2 even in the generations they still really likedAnother year in the oven could have helped but it also easily have just still not internalized them for you is what Im saying
2023-05-07T12:07:22-0400,Personally I havent had any glitches or bugs in Violet or even framerate issues Honestly it feels very overblown BotW has many glitches but I never saw people whinging about that obviously it is a better overall game plus many of those can end up being used in a positive way If a game is worse people will whinge more about stuff like this just to denigrate it further Plus these things get completely overblown by people posting shit on the internet and whining when the glitches themselves are extremely rareIve learned to block out these sorts of criticisms of video games in general over the years
2023-05-07T12:22:35-0400,Look sir idk what kind of emulator you are using but there is no way you havent noticed the absolutely massive fps drops in the lake area
2023-05-07T12:52:06-0400,and people wont by 5 different versions of the same pokemon new pokemon boost merch sales drastically the point im trying to make is that from an economic standpoint waiting even a year longer in between games is not an option as a second party developer they are under a lot of stress to make as much money as possible and that means cutting corners to get the games out on time if you have a solution for them that dosent involve shouting at them to do better or telling them to take their time and dont worry about their income like for example maybe dont do it in hd take pokemon concepts from fans debug using known glitch hunters cut out move animations ect they would probobly love to hear it but complaining about the final product will only get the games and the game makers undeserved hate and ruin everyones day this isnt a leadership problem this isnt a technical issue this is an unavoidable side effect of trying to keep up with the demand of the highest grossing media franchise of all time even now the devs are still working tirelessly to fix the issues with the game even though its already out no one here is in a position to critisize gamefreak for this and it makes my blood boil every time i see someone do this
2023-05-07T12:58:37-0400,they absolutely positively will buy them shown if nothing else by them People will buy merch because it looks cool or because it has their favorite Some lines are Eternal SellersIt is one 1 extra year It would be fine Theres a ton of Pokemon they can find new little lines to create and put outor as I mentioned before put out merch of revealed Pokemon Or bothor the lag in the various cities or in mesagoza or the very public memory leak glitches at launch or seeing all the pokemon enter their T Pose or simply running around and just seeing the game stutter trying to handle Koraidons speed loading in the next area spawning the Pokemon Or anything going on in Raids the jankiest battle styeThe really bad glitches are relatively rare but the game is absolutely full of them and really easy to notice just by casually playing the game Like I like the game I like running around Paldea It is impossible not to notice the jank and framerate
2023-05-07T13:46:31-0400,My favorite is the information admittedly hearsay that apparently one of the contributors to Scarlet being preferred for Speed Runs is because Miraidons particle and light effects make the game more prone to slowdown
2023-05-07T13:53:25-0400,Violet does lag compared to Scarlet but its not because of Miraidon since runners lose time even before they get the mount Nobody actually knows why it lagsViolet also has an outofplace loading zone in Area Zero which would save time if not for the constant lag
2023-05-07T22:32:18-0400,My issue isnt framerate or glitches its the draw distance I mean I get minor movement glitches on a regular basis on the Ride Mon but theyre not a big deal and I can handle lag But mons appear next to me if Im sprinting fast enough which does not make moving around smooth or easy
2023-05-08T18:05:46-0400,Sorry to disappoint but no I havent If there is one it hasnt affected my gameplay experience at allI have had certain lag issues in Online Raids but Ive yet to come across a game with online features where this is not an issue so no complaints here
2023-05-08T19:58:14-0400,I dont even mean lag in raids I mean things like desynching the turns the text boxes not working properly wasting time by showing the actions of another turn when it shouldnt be the ability of the game to just not acknowledge that the enemy is actually dead for like 2full turns even when doing a CPU raid
2023-05-09T01:50:48-0400,I dont understand why they cant just get help from another Japanese developer More manpower cant hurt can it
2023-05-09T03:03:51-0400,So hows the taste of bootBut seriously there is so much wrong with this Even if Game Freak stopped making Pokmon games they would still make an insane amount of money from merchandise as long as were alive as thats where the vast majority of the money comes from Charizard Pikachu and Eevee sell well enough theres no need for new Pokmon every three years All the games clearly reuse a lot of code so no they dont have to code 1000 Pokmon every single time Also best graphics feasable for the time Dont make me laugh Also thats a big strawman of people who dont like Dexit its easy to make it sound silly by focusing on one Pokmon but when hundreds are missing its easy to see why people are upset especially when features such as graphics online play etc are not improved nearly enough to compensate You can appeal to the poor Japanese workers all you want but by shutting down all criticism you are defending this system Scarlet and Violet is a mess that is so buggy that Sonic Boom laughs at it has online play that would have been seen as lackluster in the 2000s has less content than the Gen V games and graphically looks like it could have been on the PS2 And the thing is higher than Marvel higher than Star Wars so there is absolutely no excuse for this crap Game Freak doesnt care about what theyre doing because they know theyll make money either way hell Scarlet and Violet sold as much as Elden Ring and things would be much better for both the fans and the workers if they stopped but apparently its not enough that theyre already the highestgrossing media franchise they just need to squeeze out every last penny
2023-05-09T03:13:21-0400,GameFreaks doesnt make the merchandiseThat one goes to Pokemon CompanyI think you may be not aware that the games are the only thing GameFreaks makes and gets money from everything else is TPCI and Nintendo
2023-05-09T05:31:53-0400,Is that really the case though Wouldnt the directors like Masuda Ohmori and Takao Unno also get some of the money especially since the former works at TPC now
2023-05-09T10:48:17-0400,So a quick perusal of the Wikipedia page lists TPC as a joint investment between the Companies of GF Nintendo and Creatures as opposed to just individuals within those companies so my guess is that Gamefreak does majority work on the games and there are some terms in place about how revenue from the various branches of the franchise are distributed in turnOf note is that apparently Nintendo specifically handles international publishing of the Console Pokemon titles and the Console version of multiplat releases like Pokemon Unite compared to TPC in Japan in particular not sure if this remains true for SV but was true as recently as Unite in 2021 With little basis beyond that my interpretation would be that GF gets a larger cut of sales of the game among the Japanese audience due to having a larger stake in the publishing entity there compared to abroad which by extension would mean theyre more concerned with Japanese feedback about the products in particular unless prodded on it by shareholdersthe other companies
2023-05-09T13:30:16-0400,I really dont think that Scarlet and Violet were released in as bad of shape as everyone says they were It might just be me but Ive had multiple playthroughs of both games and there have been little to no noticeable bugs glitches or anything of the like Some of the famous examples just seem a bit exaggeratedAlso an honorary mention to an opinion that isnt so uncommon THERE ARE SO MANY STORY CUTSCENES Seriously if you watched the WR Pokemon Scarlet Any runs you see that the runner has a40 MINUTEgap between the game starting and when the runner is finally set free to go catch Flamigo Sure a bit of story is nice but why is there so much Its honestly just too much I dont want to mash A for any longer than like a minute
2023-05-09T13:37:52-0400,Someone has never played a final fantasy or persona game before
2023-05-09T13:42:13-0400,As someone who has played several Final Fantasy games and thinks Persona is prone to overdoing this at times I think the issue is less the amount of story cutscenes for me than their density at the beginningYou have the near hour long intro with meeting Nemona the Ride Dragon enrolling in the school and finally starting the treasure hunt and then after that you get maybe a 2 minute cutscene every 2530 minutes on the objectives many of which are fairly templated in several parts Penny showing up after a Star Base Arvens sit down to make a sandwich etc The end game in Area Zero goes back to a more frequent but still fairly tame pace for cutscenes now that youre back to a controlledlinear progression and I think the intro would have done well to streamline things a bit more to that kind of rate like maybe starting off the individual routes with their respective tutorial battles Nemonas first use of Terastalization with the Pawmi outside Mesagoza Arven giving you KoraidonMiraidons Pokeball and Penny being recruited by Team Star instead of placing them all before they open the world up to you
2023-05-09T14:32:39-0400,To be honest I was kinda memeing on that but as far as speedruns go weve been memeing in long time how in some of the older rpgs like P3 the run beats the tutorial boss after over a hour and halfI dont think that 1 hour until the starter is a huge deal what I still dont like is that they still dont let you skip cutscenes or similar things Which hurts even more due to lack of voice acting hurted much more in LA imo Most games by now either have cutscene skips fast forward or press here to skip the tutorialPokemon games could really use starting to do theseThen again they still dont want you to have multiple saves I guess they dont even consider the fact someone may want to reset and replay the game as a thing
2023-05-09T14:40:15-0400,im gonna be cancelled for thispokemon unite might be better than scarlet and violet fight me on that
2023-05-28T20:42:00-0400,Please bear in mind that this is not only the first time Ive been on here for at least a year but that Violet version is my new first Pokemon game since Ultra MoonDont know if this is an unpopular opinion but while Mints are nice and all I wish that they kept the outofbattle Synchronize ability as a secondary method to obtain the preferred nature Ever since at least as early as SunMoon Id start farming for Synchronizers right away It was kind of part of my way of settling into a new regionAnd now that practice has been rendered moot and I have to wait until I start finding these Mints instead
2023-05-28T21:24:15-0400,You can buy them wholesale in the game No need to hope for finding the one you need on the overworld or grinding for BP like in Sword and Shield
2023-05-28T23:07:23-0400,That is one experience I am more than happy to skip Grinding for BPs just to get the right naturenope just a ton of nope
2023-05-29T08:45:34-0400,I love that too its really a good step forward to making Pokemon more accessible as an Esport and facility type battles if they return in the DLC
2023-05-29T08:58:06-0400,Kind sir can you share your source of copium I too would like some of this
2023-05-30T21:22:30-0400,I just found another thing that I liked that SV has gotten rid of breeding egg moves onto hatchlingsI just found this out after transferring some hatchlings from Ultra MoonIm sure that most of these moves can be replaced with TMs and leveling up in due time But one of the most fun parts of breeding was choosing four moves and breeding them on and made Pokemon that would give otherwise useful a purpose It also made receiving Wonder Trades all the more fun and I imagine that many new players enjoyed the breeding spitbacks I randomly unleashed on the Wonder Trade networkSure it made the hatchlings even more ridiculously powerful but that too was part of the fun of raising them I wish that they kept the egg moves even if only for older Pokemon as a legacy to Gen II I loved how Gen 5 made stacking egg moves easier and I used the hell out of that starting in Gen 6I will mourn those days perhaps even more than the days of being able to transfer whatever Pokemon you like to every new game
2023-05-30T21:38:49-0400,You can still put the eggetc moves you learned onto those Pokemon in most cases you just have to use Homes move reminder Itll remember egg moves and stuff
2023-05-30T22:34:15-0400,Thats nice to know if they ever make egg moves usable in game againI bred Iron Tail onto my Gible for example
2023-05-30T23:07:00-0400,Uh Gible just doesnt learn Iron Tail this Gen but Egg moves as a concept are still around and work exactly how they did in previous games as a baselineNew Pokmon do also have full sets of Egg moves as usual since you asked For instance Shroodles Egg moves are Toxic Super Fang Swagger Copycat Cross Poison and Parting Shot thats a big selection with options it can use really wellIf breeding for them is your preference and thats all you wanted to know they definitely didnt take anything away thereIn addition to that they made it by far theits ever been to get Egg moves onto alreadyhatched Pokmon using a Mirror HerbThats one of the new items in Gen IX during a picnic it instantly copies Egg moves from other Pokmon in the team to the holder if it has a free move slot and it doesnt even get consumed so you can keep reusing it In general customizing movepools with stuff like this is more efficient than its ever been since deleting and remembering moves is just part of the regular menu nowThis makes Egg moves usable for a casual run ingame in a way they have basically never been the nextclosest things were getting one Egg move at a time from wild Pokmon through DexNav in ORAS or the Grand Underground in BDSP but now you can easily get as many Egg moves as you want onto the same Pokmon without replacing it or even going all that far out of your wayWhat RN told you is a way to get Egg moves back onto your old hatchlings from Ultra MoonScarlet and Violet youuse them ingame just as long as theyre still part of the Pokmons currentGen movepoolIron Tail for Gible is an unlucky exception but Im sure most of your hatchlings can rememberof their Egg movesIt seems like the weird exceptions and losses are moves thathappened to be TMs and TRs in SwSh but not in SV SwSh Iron Tail removed from Gibles Egg movepool because it was a TR anyway and SV just didnt put it back so it lost it more or less by accident
2023-05-31T17:30:28-0400,Okay lets see what happens if I try thisTorkoals moves like Clear Smog Eruptionand Flame Burst are missing from the relearnable movepoolSame thing for every other hatching actually Every egg move they hatched with in Ultra Moon are not relearnable outside of leveling up and TMsIts great that Pokmon can still be hatched with egg move in Violet But it sucks that you cant transfer them from previous games I havent tried it with moves only in the Violet egg move pool yet which I might have to try
2023-06-04T22:53:05-0400,First of all Comparing SV a 20 million dollar game to TotK a likely 120 million dollar game isnt fair secondly your switch has performance issues Sound like your machine has a skill issue to me AlsoDo you see my pointAlso SV is peak PokmonYeah I said it
2023-06-06T11:25:08-0400,Okay so SV or the post Gen 7 games in general have a number of issues that Id like to see fixedThe inability to transfer Pokemon with moves obtained via TMs and Egg moves from previous games even if those moves could still otherwise be obtained by those same methods It has made breeding moves in Gen 7 useless seeing as how they will be automatically deleted during the transition to Violet versionId like to be able to grow berries againThere are some moves I wont miss that have been removed such as Bestow Good for them nobody cares Then there are some such as Flame Burst in this case a move that served as a nice midlevel gap between Ember and highertier moves that I wish that they kept in the game It would be like removing moves like Psybeam or Aurora Beam for exampleBut Ive also found that Gen 9 is the most fun Ive had in a Pokmon game in a long time3D models of Pokmon with greater detail and character than in Gen 7A wilderness so vast it takes at least an hour to fully explore each part and it is so easy to get lost with constantly regenerating item Every time into the wilderness is like a treasure hunt Also I think that hunting for Gimmieghoul coins is another noteworthy addition and its fun looking for the little guys Even in towns and cities you might find items on the roofs making full use of the box legendary All and all you can do more than just run around even when you get to the point where youre mostly just breedingAccess to areas with highlevel Pokmon Ive even encountered Pokmon with levels at 60 before my third gym badge This would be terrifying to younger players but offers a challenge to more experienced players like us Even a level 40 Veluza was impossible for me to stop a couple of days ago but the good news is that my Pokmon are growing fast and could probably give that same fish Pokmon some trouble now Paldea is more like how I imagined the Pokmon world would be filled with a vast wilderness full of surprised and dangerous creatures If anything wild Pokmon are more of a challenger than the Gym Leaders I have also found that this game offers more opportunities to catch evolutions than in any previous game making it easier to fill out the Pokedex faster than ever before Ive already spotted a wild Raichu and a wild GarchompFree rein of the entire region which youre free to explore in any particular orderSo yeah there are definitely things on our wishlist that we wish that they would fix or add into the game Im still hoping that well get to revisit the neighboring Kalos region and bring back Mega Evolution there are quite a few Pokmon already in the games that could use the return of this mechanic and cement the Paldea region as my favorite region Knowing Game Freak now they probably wont
2023-06-10T10:16:01-0400,Maybe this is an unpopular opinion but I think that Megas were a great way to give Pokemon most players wouldnt otherwise give a second glance a chance for viability Sure some of them were overpowered but I think thats part of the charmIt was also fun designing teams around a single Mega
2023-06-10T12:40:35-0400,As a Gallade fan I think SV Gallade would be better than mega Gallade as sharpness increases your power even further beyond what CC can offer
2023-06-10T12:56:50-0400,The speed difference is a killer regardless of the power gain from Sharpness
2023-06-10T20:34:40-0400,That requires an additional setup turn on a Pokemon that does not take hits well its not a clean solution
2023-06-10T20:47:29-0400,Ok equal they both have their own ups and downsGalladeMega has to rely on Zen Headbutt for psychic Stab while regular Gallade uses 105 bp high crit psycho cut If they give mega Gallade sharpness it will truely outclass regular Gallade in my eyes
2023-06-10T21:21:41-0400,You know gen 9 National Dex is a thing you could go test this out empirically At present it looks like the Mega is winning being in RUBL while the base form is in regular RU note that Natdex doesnt have an official NU or lower so the power gap may or may not be higher than it seems Beautifly is also NDRU
2023-06-21T13:56:19-0400,Clear Smog and Eruption are level up moves for Torkoal not Egg moves Flame Burst stopped existing back in Gen 8
2023-06-23T18:22:06-0400,Ok after all the official mons got leaked theres one line that pretty much captured everyones heartsThe tinkas And ngl I see why Theyre pretty cute they have a godlike type combination they have decent performances on in game runs and competitive matches not la creme de la creme or anything but still solidand theyre sociopathsThis is all well and good tho for me personally Imay or maynot prefer thebread dogsFor all tinka fan who arent losing their minds rnYeah basically I like the dachsbun line more than the tinkas The reason for this iswell Im not sure tbh Maybe its the combination of being more appealed to their designs the tinkas hands have always been a little weird to me and fidough and dachsbun seem cuter in a way that I cant describe and having used one to great success in my playthrough lvl 18 play rough is still insane Tho with that said I by no means think the tinkas are horrible Theyre pretty cool and I can see why people became obsessed with them I just wanted to put my silly little personal preference out thereWith that said I still stand by my opinions I put earlier in the thread dudunsparce is still not disappointing and the bugs still arent that annoying If anything lake casseroya has gotten a little less laggier for me tho thats probably just my system idk That or I got too used to them to the point I dont notice idk
2023-06-29T05:36:26-0400,GameFreak should have waited until early 2023 to release these games This would have given them time to fix the huge number of glitches and bugs in these games Because the amount of glitches make the game feel rushed and unfinished in my opinion
2023-06-29T05:56:02-0400,Im not quite sure how this is unpopular if anything thats what everyone thinksRegardless thats not a possibility GF doesnt make the release datesAny complaint about release schedule has to be directed toward TPCI or Nintendo whichever makes them and we pretty much widely aknowledged by now that pushing back the releases isnt something they are able to do short term since itd fuck up the schedule of literally everything else in the Pokemon FranchiseIn order to take more time between releases itd probably need a very long term rescheduling of the pokemon franchise as a whole something TPCI is definitely not willing to be bothered with
2023-07-04T06:42:24-0400,Thanks for the reply Glad to hear my opinion is quite popular Its a shame TPCi arent willing to change the release schedule of the series Since if the new games had an extra year development wed get a much better Pokemon game Instead they seem to now choose quantity over quality sadly
2023-07-04T12:12:09-0400,GameFreak is probably very involved in release date projections TPC is literally made of a third board members but even beyond that theyre the developer and likely work in tandem with nintendo on projected release dates and issuesLikewise I think people overstate the series inability to make a 4 year plan instead of a 3 year plan Theres plenty of merchandise they can and likely would be able ot make and if they had a sudden delay that also wouldnt matter because theres nothing stopping them from making merchandise of what has been revealed Also likely why they dont hit the ground running with full merch of stuff that hadnt been revealed yetIf theres anything the end of last gen showed its that it doesnt matter if there was a delay The TCG didnt launch until 2 or 3 months after the games came out the SV Anime is 1 still not even really SV and 2 premiered 5 months into the generation Things can be unmoored for a bit and adjust on the fly Heck the anime has been flexible for a while in how it acknowledges midgen games too DP only barely had a Platinum tie in it threw a small chunk of episodes that could have been moved around for HGSS ORAS was acknowledged mostly just through Megas and to an extent the new rival BDSP was handled by just having more Sinnoh episodes in this the anime that just went everywhere in the pokeworld and Legends Arceus was contained to a separate special that also didnt even actually advertise Legends Arceus The little side materials like Hisuian Snow are web animes that can likely be held onto until theyre ready to meet hte delay or aired as a preview if Nintendo can sit on games for over a year then TPC can sit on completed web animes that dont have any real merch to rely on until its game is actually outAnd thats again just on the delay metric the moment they lay out a 4 year plan this all becomes less of an ordealPoint is The Pokemon machine is overly complex but I think if Gamefreak the ones literally making the games or Nintendo the ones approving producing and distributing the games either needed more time up front or needed a sudden delay then TPC literally just a marketing merchandising arm thats made of 23rds GameFreak Nintendo would just have to deal with it and it becomes significantly easier to deal with it when youre working on a projected 4 year schedule and not a 3 year scheduleBasically its probably more of a mutual problem Perhaps one theyve started thinking more about DLC expansions likely takes less manpower and time than a proper third version giving BDSP to ILCA is still an interesting move even if LA was meant as a similar time frame if nothing else but still one theyre all just going this is probably fine about
2023-07-04T12:51:54-0400,I mean when it all comes down to it the games despite any issues and complaints sold amazingly as expected and the other aspects of the franchise continue to truck along I mean has the perceived quality of SV in particular made any actual affect on profits As long as they keep bringing in the money as it surely looks like for the foreseeable future their mindset will surely be if it aint broke dont fix it
2023-07-04T12:53:56-0400,Well yesntHaving low quality games that still sell due to franchise is a risky path to walk because it means that if you end up doing one mistake too much you will have much less chance of people to skip over it due to the qualityObviously that doesnt exactly mean that either of the 3 parties cares but theres a inherent risk of producing several low quality titles in a row you risk breaking the rope
2023-07-04T16:16:56-0400,Alright what Im about to say is probably the EPIDEMY of unpopular opinions and it might probably make everyone in the fandom flame me But frankly idc This is what the thread is for after allDespite all the technical goofs scarlet and violet are imo still good gamesAre they flawed Oh absolutely The bad performance the confusing open world the regional gimmick the powercreep all that jazz However Ive always personally believed that the reactions have been a LITTLE overblown Like people just seem to overlook the positive aspects they provided all because of the graphics and all that Which fair enough if graphics are a decisive factor for u then maybe these games arent ur cup of tea But it does frustrate me that it practically undermines the fun characters ost new mons and better in battle poses at least better than before u cant tell me ss leafeon looks more dynamic than sv leafeon Not gen 5 sprite level of movement but definitely an improvement etcNow frankly this probably contributes nothing to the conversation unless the opinion of a conformist was needed and then again I already probably talked about these elsewhere I just wanted to contribute my two cents to this And again its ok if u dont like them Im not on some grand quest to make everyone like em thatd be ridiculousTLDR I like SV despite all the glitches and stuff Pls dont kill me for it
2023-07-07T09:45:43-0400,Oh u know people not knowing where exactly to go and thus ending up challenging gym leaderstitansstar bases theyre either too underleveled or overleveled for I had seen a lot of comments about that so I decided to mention it tho I think I couldve worded it betterOh well
2023-07-07T10:28:26-0400,You could ask for pointers in the Pokemon Centers tho
2023-07-07T10:30:22-0400,The Pokemon Centers literally just point to the nearest thing you havent done yetThis is actually the crux of that specific problem because a bunch of people beat Brassius and then the Centers near by just say to try Mela
2023-07-07T21:42:55-0400,Anyone else think that the gen 8 models look better than the gen 9 ones I mean look at pult
2023-07-07T22:30:54-0400,The slightly jaggier tail doesnt bug me too much I think Ive seen it smooth out in game but I do like SWSHs textures on the models more yeahThe trade off being I think the new ones react to lighting better but SWSHs colors are quite vibrant across the board in a way that SV is not since its going for a different aesthetic
2023-09-06T09:48:38-0400,Pokmon Black and White are average at best and Scarlet and Violet are the best games in series
2023-09-06T09:54:50-0400,Thats because it likely is made out of shiny Revavroom that has been worn by the desert winds losing its shiny gold making it look bronze
2023-09-06T09:57:25-0400,Fracterra you know you can just edit your posts or queue up multiple quotes at once in the reply box right
2023-09-06T10:07:32-0400,And GF has 169 employees compared to Nintendos whatThere were also people working on the dlc and on the next Pokemon gameI did not know the second partWe love her because she is a sociopathAnd other notable open world games Cough Cough Tears of the Kingdom have much longer open endings like 2 and a half hour openings
2023-09-14T02:02:01-0400,GAMEFREAK should just do the right thing and disqualify everyone from worlds Im pretty sure that will solve all the problems
2023-09-14T11:49:52-0400,Forget the Championship Gamefreak should cancel the world while were at it
2023-09-15T06:52:54-0400,I mean I dont think this is necessarily unpopular if you break the rules you should be disqualified its more people wanting the rule to be changed for the future
2023-09-15T08:27:57-0400,I dunno I saw a lot of people go they DIDNT deserve it because how can gamefreak expect people to make them legit when theres still so much cruft to work withWhich lord knows gamefreak still needs to alleviate various factors the tera shards are only partially better after the DLC the pokemon availability thing is still not resolved but does seem to bury the whole cheating at a competition that doesnt want you cheating is playing with fire if they ever decide to crack down on cheating thingmy opinion is if youre going to cheat Kurts run down of rental teams shows people aaaaabsolutely know they just dont care to hide it even though its so easyAnd this applies to the idiots on GTS who couldnt hack a proper Legends pokemon to save their lives
2023-09-15T13:16:11-0400,It is definitely a controversial opinion at least Some part of it is legitimate gripes about how hard it can be to get certain Pokmon Others are less legitimate and quite frankly boil down to the fact that cheating is so normalized in the VGC community that the minute theres halfway decent enforcement people cry about how unfair it is they are punished for breaking rules they agreed to Frankly Showdown doesnt help with how easy it is to just simply simulate a mon that may as well be impossible to get Remember how much of a common option for Chansey and Blissey was Wish A move that you could only get in Gen 3 from a specific event In the actual games if you need a Wish ChanseyBlissey for your team you have to either cheat one in or just suck it up and find something else to fill that role On Showdown it doesnt matter Itbe legal therefore you can just put it inIt also doesnt help that the people who are much more vocal about the cheating problem have their own issues to put it lightly Kurt is probably the best person saying how its a problem but given how hes the one who made the software used to gen in the first place it makes him less credible Add in the drama chasers we wont mention here even though we all know who they are and bad arguments from the anticheating side which often devolve into cheating is wrong because cheating is wrong it isnt surprising to see how it can be an unpopular opnionReally the only way I see cheating going away is if there is physically no way to do it As much as people say it gives no advantage it clearly does or else so many people wont do it It cuts down the time and effort needed to build a decent team so you can spend more time actually battling as well as giving you access to mons that are otherwise to impractical to get on your own Even if they had something you could use to lower a Pokmons IVs or otherwise modify them to give you anything you could possibly need genning would still be faster as you dont need to gather those resources or even catch the Pokmon to begin with
2023-09-15T13:53:54-0400,Yeah theres never not going to be cheating they could simplify it even more and should to be clear theres really no reason for things like ability patches and HA to still be this level of annoying PP Maxes should just be sold tera shards should really only take 25 max and should honestly be something yo ucan freel yswap between once bought for that pokemon IV lowering thing the EV cleaner should have been base game and so forth and it would still be there because unless its literally a battle sim pokemon editor its always going to be too much And even if they had that youll still have people who dont want to bother and just want someone else to do it for themThus I say again if youre going to cheat cheatbecause a properly cheated Pokemon will be indistinguishable from a normal Pokemon Or at least have differences so imperceptible that most people wont notice Then we can just go back to the you know we know you know we know standoff and everyone can just keep cruising alongAt least have a dedicated community cheater who hacks up on all the needed items or something
2023-09-15T14:05:51-0400,Ironically iirc that was the main reason for the bans people who got banned had very poorly made mons that were super easy to scoopThere were a ton of genned mons as usual and the properly made ones did not get punishedI do however moderately disagree with make everything easily accessible Sadly it does fight with what they want to do with the games aka keep some pseudoliveservice to keep people playing them even after beating themI know how annoying it is to get ability patches and tera crystals I hate it myself but if they dont force you to grind partecipate to raids the games online will be dead within a month outside of the actual VGCThey would need to change design model before they can allow easy access to competitive changing items
2023-09-15T14:17:49-0400,Which is why I keep saying cheat better Look at your better cheating peersYou can absolutely do both make things easily accessible and pseudolive serviceLike Ability Patches You can make those a 5 or 10 drop easy and it would immediately be better while still needing you on The Grind25 tera shards still takes time especially if you want to keep swapping them across your teamTheres 0 reason you cant buy PP Maxes its just convenience Honestly same for gold bottle caps too The ones they sell at the auction house are just a scam compared to buying the bottle caps you needEverything still costs money which you have to earnand so on
2023-09-15T14:21:47-0400,TBH a problem is you have people who claim that they absolutely dont cheat or offload responsibility by saying they have friends to catch them which creates a false impression for some people that cheating is less of a problem than it actually is If youre actually involved you know its omni present If you arent its in peoples best interest to keep it hidden because shockingly TPC might not be too happy when prominent VGC voices are telling people to break the rules or that they might do it themselves This only makes it harder for people who are just getting in because they might not be aware that the reason they are too slow to adapt to meta trends or that they cant seem to get the exact right stats for their mons that everyone else seems to have is because they just genned themOn the one hand I can understand wanting to not have it so that everything is given to you with no challenge but on the other hand reducing grinding is generally a good thing To borrow a phrase complaining about making the grind easier is like complaining about empty traffic Besides people will still do raids for other reasons I mean not everyone goes into the game wanting to be some VGC champ
2023-09-15T14:23:58-0400,calling nemona xenophobic or racist is dumb as hell if i thought my town was becoming some tourist trap for people who didnt respect my culture id beat them with rocks if they were spanish id beat them with hammers
2023-09-15T14:29:59-0400,I assume you mean CarmineAlso I guess I shouldnt be surprised people feel that way about her But even ignoring the valid feelings shes also like what 17 18 tops Honestly probably even 16 but with a big ego Its fine for her to be overprotective about the place you love hm weird almost like this is a character flaw that applies to the rest of her life well anywayEspecially when by the end she realizes she overreactedIt is very funny that the Caretaker is absolutely trying to turn it into a tourist trap though lmfao he lets it slip in the post game
2023-09-15T14:35:38-0400,oooh im dumb as hell id edit it but its funnier to let it uppokemon fans have this issue of constantly going grrr grrr why is there no mean rivals anymore why is everyone so nice but as soon as we get protags that have a bit of nuance theyre all bad people or something with carmine its not as prevalent because she made a quick 180 but even then having to see ppl say shes xenophobic or abusive to kieran over the most basic teenager characterization made me realize pokemon fans only want very shallow mean rivals and evil teams which is kinda lame
2023-09-16T10:17:01-0400,Yeah its silly I mean BlueSilverGladion are some of the most popular if not most popular for me they are probs my top 3 rivals in the series All 3 are generally dicks though Gladion gets some heavy backstory and character growth Silver does too in the remakes But yeah so mean rivals good but then people complain so stupidIm hoping Kieran is just a mean mean person in all of Part 2 we already have his backstory ofc but I kinda hope he just treats us like trash
2023-09-30T15:51:25-0400,Getting rid of Scald was the greatest competitive choice that Scarlet and Violet made and Im honestly still really disappointed that they chose to bring it backIt is true that they limited Scalds distribution pretty drastically and I like this approach with Toxic its a powerful defensive tool but its available to a few nonPoison types that have reasonable associations with poison Its a much better approach than simply giving Toxic to literally everything I will say it is certainly an improvement over preGen 9 where practically every single Water type could learn it This is a concession Ill readily make the state of Scald and its distribution isbetter than it used to beFor starters I just think Scald is fundamentally an unbalanced move A Water type move that can burn is just very difficult to deal with because Water covers the one type that can safely switch into a burn move Just from a flavor standpoint I also dislike the idea of Water types being just as if not more consistent than Fire types at burning things We also got Chilling Water just this gen a much more balanced move that fulfilled a similar function to Scald without being as overtuned lower BP and a weaker effect but also a much moreone I dont know if Chilling Water ever had widespread usage in any format but I think its still a much more reasonable power level than Scald which was everywhere Why introduce this move to begin with if youre just going to bring its superior version back with DLC Matcha Gotcha is an even stronger move with the healing but A its a signature move meaning its distribution is nil and B its a Grass move so you can switch in a Fire type with no concernAnd among the mons that they chose to give the move they still gave it to annoying bulky Waters Nothing as bad as Toxapex but even if Slowbroking learn Flamethrower I really dont think they should be able to click such a defensively powerful move Alomomola also got enough of a buff with Flip Turn if you ask me If they had to keep Scald around I genuinely do think it should be limited to Simipour and Volcanion only both of whom naturally learn it and have the flavor to justify it Itd also be fair game for any FireWater types to learn it of course I still believe in the glorious return of Bomushika
2023-10-21T15:00:39-0400,Friend Guard Evolite Clefairy is terrible for raidsNot because of stats or strategy but because unenlightened internet randos will assume youre a troll and abandon the raid
2023-10-24T13:02:20-0400,Yeah I like using that set its very goodI disagree I dont like rivals who I want to commit unspecified acts of violence against because of how there head is stuck up their rear ya get me Bust I respect your opinion
2023-10-24T20:09:02-0400,Yes thats why committing violence against them wont get you in trouble
2023-10-30T10:57:27-0400,Yeah and I dont have that kind of money if that explains my reaction
2023-12-23T23:47:53-0500,Ok I will say something controversialI believe that SV is better than PLA and I have 4 main reasonsMore new Pokemon to play with discover etcThe imo best rivals the series has ever hadArea Zero is goddamn beautifulCool new widespread moves
2023-12-26T10:21:13-0500,I would agree SV is better than PLA for all those reasonsMy unpopular opinion is that the DLC isnt really worthwhile and its only redeeming feature is to give you a few more pokemon you wouldnt get otherwise
2023-12-27T22:53:48-0500,I know my opinion on the SV DLC isnt worth as much when I dont have it but no Battle Facility makes it much worse than the SwSh DLC Restricted Sparring is really fun and no Battle Facility is why I didnt get the SV DLC
2024-03-29T05:27:56-0400,No increased Shiny Odds on the baby event is absolute bullshit fume
2024-03-31T00:37:47-0400,As a Pichu fan who is not only a Pichu fan but would also appreciate a reason to hop on my Violet save again Ill have to agree with thisLets ignore the fact that unfortunately Pichus Shiny just isnt that different from the original in these games anyway
2024-03-31T16:08:29-0400,I think they should get rid of shinies entirely unless the player is actively hunting for them the joy of catching a random shiny is infinitely outweighed by the pain of failing one
